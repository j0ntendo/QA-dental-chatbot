Dr M: This tooth does have a large filling, but does not appear cracked. Based on this photo, and the lack of any symptoms, you don't need to crown the tooth right away. If a part of it breaks in the future, you can then consider a crown. adodplantation: It's completely understandable to feel skeptical when a dentist suggests additional procedures, especially when you're not experiencing any discomfort.\n\nI'd recommend getting a second opinion from a different dentist. They can independently assess your situation and provide alternative treatment options or recommendations. It's also important to understand the potential consequences of delaying treatment, such as further damage to the tooth or surrounding area."

Also when I go to bed I put some of the toothpaste onto the tooth as well.\n\nI am only drinking water, tea and milk. I have cut out all sugary foods and drinks.\n\nThe filling is still in place, I do not really have pain when drinking hot and cold things, just a slight discomfort. I can chew on it ok, but only done it for a test, again just brings discomfort. I have a constant dull ache that throbs every now and then. I also have a metallic taste in my mouth as well. \n\nI did this on Tuesday 7th April, will the tooth be ok?

A damaged filling can expose your tooth to bacteria, leading to decay, infection, or further structural damage. Waiting too long can exacerbate these issues, resulting in more extensive and costly treatments, such as root canals or crowns.\n\nIdeally, you should schedule an appointment with your dentist within a few days of noticing the damage. This prompt action can prevent complications and ensure your tooth is properly protected. If you experience pain, sensitivity, or any signs of infection, it's essential to seek dental care immediately.\n\nFor those looking for professional and prompt dental care, FloMo Dental offers comprehensive services to address issues like damaged fillings and more.

    "dialogue": "Bluebellas: Hi, so I have done a RCT on my upper left molar but 2 weeks after the treatment, pain presented in the gum area near the treated tooth. This subsided but there’s still some pain (2 out of 10 pain level) and the treated tooth hurts on pressure. Dentist says to observe for a month. My gut feel is the RCT has failed.\n\nDuring observation, I used my right side to eat. My right lower molar had a bad chip and my gums hurt badly. This subsided after abt 3 days. I have since gone for the first session of RCT with another dentist for this tooth.\n\nMy question is, I’m due to visit the first dentist on the “failed” RCT before I meet the second dentist to complete the RCR. If the first dentist suggests retreatment, should I do it after I complete the RCT for the second problem tooth or even after the crown is completed? Dr M: Do you have any x-rays you could share about the tooth in question? The pain could be,because of a lot of reasons. Sometimes the filling is a bit too high, or sometimes there is a gap, leading to food impaction, which leads to gum pain, which can feel like tooth pain."

    "title": "Pain after onlay",
    "dialogue": "djaychela: I recently had two onlays.  My #6 and 7 teeth on the lower right-hand side had old amalgam fillings from when I was 20 or so and one of them had broken up a bit.  So my dentist said I needed both of them replaced (he's always angling for replacing the amalgam as he says they look bad; I don't really care about that as I've had them for 30 years)... and £750 later I had two new onlays.  One definitely felt proud when the anaesthetic wore off.  I was in pain straight away, and this is on a tooth with no history of pain (and was NOT the one where the filling was starting to break up).  It's constant discomfort, and eating or cold makes is really bad - a sharp stabbing pain that takes minutes to subside.  I've been taking paracetamol so I can sleep.\n\nLeft it a week as my wife said I should see if it settles down, which it didn't.  So I called the dentist, went back a couple of days later with my concerns, and was asked to sign a root canal authorisation before I'd even seen the dentist, which I refused to do (as aside from anything else the paperwork said I'd seen the dentist and discussed the situation and my questions had been answered, none of which was true).\n\nSo he dressed the proudness (took three goes to do it), plus there was some (UV?) light shone in there as well.  He gave me a week's course of antibiotics.  I'm a few days in and there's no change, and if I continue on his suggested course then I'll be back in for a root canal, and according to his price list this will be at least £650 for this.\n\nI don't see why a tooth with no history of pain or tenderness would suddenly start hurting unless something was wrong with the inlay?  When I brought this up with the dentist he just sidestepped the question with a \"not every procedure works every time\" kind of answer. Dr M: It does sound like the nerve was damaged. Drilling on a tooth, if there is no  clear indication to do so, unfortunately always caries a risk. The risks, as well as possibility of a root canal, should have been discussed with you as part of the informed consent process,"

    "dialogue": "PaulY: Five months ago I had a post and core crown fitted. After two weeks it fell out. I had the crown re-glued and four months later it has come loose again. This time the post is still firmly glued in but I believe that the glue between the old root and the new crown has deteriorated and come away and now the tooth wobbles. My dentist is reluctant to put pressure on the tooth to try remove the post and re-glue it in case he fractures the root so has not offered any treatment . Can anything be done to stop the tooth from wobbling? Dr M: Do you perhaps have any x-rays of the post that you could share? It is strange that it comes loose so often PaulY: Unfortunately I don't have the x-rays. I have a feeling that it might be my dentist's first attempt as he told me he had sent pictures to his professor of the finished work. With this in mind maybe he used the wrong glue or didn't ensure everything was dry the first time. The tooth in question is number twelve and fractured leaving only the root. I assume that when it was glued into place a certain amount of glue was used between the base of the crown and the root as well as the post ( a sliver came out a couple of weeks before the tooth loosened ) and that it is this which has come loose creating a small gap. I don't know how it all works and just wondered if a dentist was able to unsolidify the glue to re-position the crown. As I said he hasn't offered to do this. Do I have to just put up with my wobbly crown? Dr M: You can use a ultrasonic scaler tip, that vibrates, in order to loosen the post. If your dentist is not experienced in this, ask him to refer you to someone, that might be able to assist in your area PaulY: Thank you that makes a lot of sense! MattKW: When you say tooth 12, do you mean American numbering (UNS) or International numbering (FDI)?\nIf FDI 12, then those lateral incisors have a very poor chance of success with post and cores. I would normally advise patient to start saving for an implant. \nI have done hundreds of posts, both direct and indirect.

Unfortunately my dentist has indicated that he thinks it a minor miracle that he managed to perform the procedure and seems at a loss as to how the crown has loosened. In your opinion how strong should the crown be and could using floss and interdentals on it be the cause of it loosening?"

MattKW: About 5-10% of crowned teeth develop the need for an RCT. I can't say exactly why in your case, but generally speaking, a tooth that needs a crown has already had extensive fillings, so the \"nerve\" has been damaged many times. A crown prep can be all that's needed to push it over the edge. If not settling within 2 weeks, I start getting ready for RCT. The risk of an RCT is normally discussed when talking about the pros and cons of crowns."

    "title": "DENTIST NOW SAYS I NEED 19 CROWNS - a few months ago it was 1 minor cavity.",
    "dialogue": "Crick74: Hello….this is the first time I’ve ever been in this forum so I appreciate your taking the time to read my post. I know this is long but please read bc I really need some help, please. \n\nAbout three weeks ago, my life changed completely. I was scheduled to have a root canal / crown on one of my front lower teeth at my dentist. I’ve had root canals and crowns before so I’m very aware of what the procedure involves. My dentist numbed my mouth and began working, and after about 45 minutes he stopped and told me that he wasn’t going to be able to save the tooth….that it cracked into when he was drilling. Then something happened that I had NEVER experienced at any dental office. My dentist, who I have been seeing for around ten years, begins acting very strange. It is very difficult to explain, you almost have to have been there and personally experienced this to understand what I’m talking about but he almost acted as if he was appalled by me and giving up on me as a patient. He looked like he had seen a ghost or something, just had this mortified expression on his face and acted like he was at the end of his rope with me. He told me that he doesn’t know what to do anymore with me. He said ‘Every one of your teeth are going to need some type of restoration. I see at least fifteen or so teeth that are going to need crowns because we can no longer continue doing patchwork with fillings. It’s time to decide if your going to want to restore your teeth or just give up on them.’ And it wasn’t necessarily what he said to me as much as how he said it that puzzled me. This dentist had done all kinds of work on me for ten years and he suddenly treated me very rudely and almost acted like he just wanted to wash his hands of me and move on. I am just a patient and don’t know anything about this stuff, so at this point I was feeling very shocked and uncomfortable. I was confused, and let me explain why I was confused. This was a few weeks ago near the end of February. Allow me to go back around five months to my last cleaning and appointment with him. I have my teeth cleaned twice a year, every six months….I would say I am in the dentist office more than the average person and I try to take care of my teeth but over the years, I have had to have a lot of work done. My teeth have always been prone to cavities and I’m sure some of my habits don’t help , but all my life I have had my teeth cleaned every six months and when something comes up that I need, I always have it done.\n\n Anyway, five months earlier I am having my teeth cleaned and at the cleaning, the following issues were discussed…..\n\n- I had a tooth in the very back that had a crown on it. I believe it was a crown that he had done a couple of years earlier. This crown had become loose when me and my family were visiting my wife’s mother in Orlando a few weeks prior to this appointment. This crowned tooth ended up just falling out when I was out of town. It just broke off. I didn’t do anything to cause this. I’m guessing that it had been gradually becoming loose wout me knowing and food had been getting up under the crown and causing more decay. That’s my best guess. I had never had anything like this happen. It just came out. And the root of the tooth remained. When he saw this, he almost acted rude about it, like it was my fault. He said ‘Well, I see you lost a tooth’ but in a very fed up tone. Like I caused this crowned tooth to fail and just fall out. He said ‘at some point we will need to remove the root of that tooth but it’s not urgent.’\n- The next issue was another tooth in the very back that he said needed to be crowned and have a root canal. He said this is the priority. \n- He also said I needed a root canal and crown on a front bottom tooth. A few months prior to this I had come in to ask him about this one bc I noticed what felt like a filling come loose behind the front tooth and I could feel the place that it came out. I thought it just needed to be refilled. When I went in he said…..’no, that’s going to need a root canal and crown. Are you feeling pain or sensitivity?’ I said no, it didn’t hurt at all. I really questioned needing a root canal and crown. I thought it should just be filled. I didn’t have the money at the time so it was put on hold. \n- Other than these TWO bigger issues, they told me at my cleaning that I had only ONE OTHER SMALL CAVITY TO BE FILLED WHICH COULD WAIT UNTIL AFTER THESE OTHER TWO BIGGER THINGS WERE DONE. This is a key element in this story. At this cleaning ……I had ONE small cavity to be filled. \n*****THERE WAS NO MENTION OF MY TEETH NEEDING FIFTEEN OR MORE CROWNS, basically a full restoration to save the teeth I have left. *******\n\nI made an appointment to have the root canal and crown on the back tooth and I went in the following week to have the work done. When he started drilling, same thing happened…..he said he couldn’t save the tooth, that it was too decayed. He extracted it instead. I then made an appointment to fix the front tooth a couple of weeks later. I ended up needing to reschedule the appointment bc I was still trying to save up a bit more money to have it done, and they knew this. I said I could have the money in two weeks, but they said the next opening for me was nearly four months away…..even though this was important. I took it. And when the time of my appointment rolled around, it ended up being too late to save the tooth and he made me feel horrible for waiting. I didn’t want to wait that long. I needed to get the funds together and when I had them, then they pushed me off for four months. \n\nSo now, let’s go back to where I began the story. I am sitting there hearing him tell me that ……\n\n- The tooth in the front couldn’t be saved bc I waited too long (it was actually bc I couldn’t get an appointment sooner).\n- And now, the doctor is telling me that almost every tooth in my mouth needs ‘restoration’ or I will eventually loose them all. That he can no longer use fillings to fix any areas of decay. He pointed out around 15-16 teeth that he said needed a crown. He said that at this point these teeth are still healthy and can be saved but thinking long term, they will all need to be crowned. THIS WAS MAJOR. \n\n****JUST FIVE MONTHS EARLIER AT MY CLEANING, I WAS TOLD I HAD ONE OTHER SMALL CAVITY TO BE FILLED BESIDES THE TWO OTHER BIGGER ISSUES I LISTED (the back tooth and the front tooth). Now 16+ teeth need to be crowned! I felt like this was a huge jump from my last cleaning. ****\n\nAnd it was also how he told me …..the way he made me feel. I have super thick skin. I have been through A LOT in my life. I don’t get my feelings hurt. When I left his office, I felt like a horrible person who cares nothing about themselves. I’m a 49 year old man, husband of 26 years, father of two 13 year old twins, and I went home and immediately called my sister crying. That’s how bad this dentist made me feel. How he looked at me. Dentists are supposed to be comforting and supportive, not break people down. I am paying him to work on my mouth. He made me feel like I would be lucky if he gave me another shot. He made a comment in front of a female assistant that I had some stuff in between my teeth and he said i obviously don’t have good hygiene skills. And I said ‘Well what is where that tooth was?’ He said he put a temporary in its place and that it would probably start giving me problems after awhile. He didn’t offer any other options , that’s all he said is that it probably wont last long. I said ‘so what do I need to do?’ He said….’well, my first thought is nothing bc it’s obvious that you don’t care about your teeth.’ I said I do care. And then he said in a very frustrated and rushed way…..’well, here. I have a few more minutes I can spare. Let’s take a look. ‘ then he started naming off tooth numbers to the assistant…..listed around 17 teeth…..he said these all need crowns because fillings wont work anymore and if you don’t crown them you’ll lose them and have to get dentures or implants . But if your not going to take care of the crowns there’s no sense in getting them. \n\nLet me say this…..I am not one to give excuses for my mistakes but this isn’t an excuse, this is reality. Fourteen years ago I injured my lower spine and I was never the same. After failed back surgeries, I was never able to be free of severe pain in both of my legs …..every single second for fourteen years. It never left, not one second. I’ve dedicated myself completely to raising my son and daughter who are now 13. Every bit of ME went into them. I haven’t been able to work full time in over five years. My wife supports us. We have no funds to spare. I have always cared about my teeth and oral hygiene, but I will admit, yes there have been times that I didn’t pay enough attention to taking care of myself exactly as I should as far as my teeth are concerned. I’m not making excuses, I’m just trying to say that life is hard and sometimes it’s easy to overlook things and not care for ourselves 100%. That doesn’t mean my dentist of ten years has the right to make me feel that I should just go bury my head in the sand bc my mouth looks awful and I’m a 49 year old man w poor hygiene. This embarrassed me! I am a fantastic father and a loving loyal husband and I went home literally crying to my sister about how much of a loser I have become and that I’m never going to find a way out of this. That my life is just a constant cycle of getting further and further into this hole that I can’t escape from. And now I can’t get out. \n\nThe past few weeks have been horrible. I tried to put it out of my head. When I got myself together, I called them and asked for a treatment plan. The plan is for 19 crowns and it is $20,000 of dental work. And I was left w a temporary tooth in front with no indication of how long this will last or what to do. I can’t afford this. And I’m so confused. I thought this was the reason I went in every six months to have my teeth cleaned…..to avoid something like this coming up. Just five months ago…..ONE MINOR CAVITY! What happened, what changed? Now $20k of dental crowns????? \n\nI have done a lot of research into this. I was concerned that the root of that tooth that fell out could be creating bacteria that was damaging my other teeth but I asked them about that and they just ignored me. Now I am looking into going to Turkey to do this for much less money. Honestly, I don’t know what to do. I feel like this is the end for me. I have been feeling panicked. I don’t even feel like me anymore! Dr M: This case sounds complex. There is a chance that a lot of work is needed and the dentist failed to inform you about this earlier and only did ''patch'' work. I would suggest seeking a second opinion before doing any major restorative work such as crowns, since this can be very destructive to your teeth, if not indicated. Crick74: Okay, thank you. I do have an appointment with another highly recommended dentist to get their opinion. I may get their opinion wout even mentioning what my dentist suggested. So that it’s an unbiased opinion. Am I correct to think that it is strange that only four months ago I was told that I only needed one minor cavity filled? I think it’s also worth noting that I have already spent thousands of dollars on dental work in the past few years. Just a few years ago, I had four teeth done. Root canal and crown on all four. One crown I had done that was in the very back began getting food caught up under it and the tooth decayed so much that it just came out. I had no idea until it was too late . And he has extracted three of my back teeth. I know nothing about teeth except what I need to do on a daily basis to care for them. So I can’t on my dentist to advise me and do what’s needed to keep my teeth and mouth healthy. And bc of some of the things that have happened the way they did, I just can’t help but think that some of this could be his fault . I’m not trying to make excuses or cast blame but just four months ago I needed one minor cavity fixed. I’ve even wondered if this has something to do w him feeling that I am wasting his time when I come in and he cannot complete the root canal and crown on the tooth bc the tooth has died. Maybe he doesn’t like me for this and is giving me a treatment plan that will make me leave. My teeth aren’t beautiful but they also don’t look THAT BAD. But this is causing me major stress. If I think he may be to blame for some of this should I consult with a lawyer? Dr M: Wait for your second opinion first."

    "title": "Re-crowning vs. Extraction",
    "dialogue": "Michael Thomas: Hello,\n\nI had a layered zirconia crown placed on my first molar (bottom left). It was a recommendation to prevent fracture as I have a history of grinding. Prior to the crown prep the tooth had a moderate divot on the surface and a dull ache (reoccurring PDL sprain). Aside from that the tooth was healthy and fully intact - no previous fillings and/or damage. After the crown prep I still had a dull ache but the tooth also became sensitive to hot and cold and painful to chewing. One year after the crown prep I had a root canal due to the symptoms persisting. Following RCT the tooth still has sensation - including a dull ache as well as occasional sensitivity and chewing pain. My 3D scan did not show signs of fracture and the endodontist reports a successful RCT as he did not find anything wrong with his microscope. It’s been suggested that the tooth may have been over-reduced during crown prep and that the RCT exacerbated the situation. The endodontist and my new dentist have speculated that the tooth has structural damage and needs to be extracted. I’m struggling with this opinion as the purpose of crowning was to prevent fracture, extraction. Question: Can a tooth that has potentially been over-reduced and has ongoing symptoms after RCT be re-crowned or is extraction the only option? \n\nFor additional perspective, I’ve provided a 3D image of the tooth prior to RCT. \n\nThank you. Brause: I am in a similar situation...and after hearing from a friend that one of his mandibular molars received RCT and he broke two crowns: extraction!\n\nOne of my molars received RCT, which did absolutely nothing. It was extracted. This after a 5-month period of pain and $$$$ of useless treatment.\n\nI have talked to a lot of people, most of them had experience with RCT...and it worked well in the fewest cases. RCT is temporary patchwork imho...a time bomb in the end.\n\nNow I have a similar issue again and will not put up with all that crap again.\n\nAnother issue I have after extended experience with dental specialists in my environment recently: they are really greedy! Excessive profits with pain: goes completely against my grain."

The crown was placed 12 years ago, root canals were done and a short post inserted.\n\nA few days after it happened I went to see a dentist to check on this tooth, and I felt discomfort and some pain when using water pick around that side of the tooth where the popcorn shell damaged the gum. The X-ray was done and no visible damage to this crowned tooth was determined. It was recommended to give it time for the gum to heal.\n\nGradually after, the crown started to move. I have the appointment scheduled to go to the dentist and would like to be prepared for possible treatment options.\n\nWhat might have happened to the crown? Is there a chance to glue back the same crown? Might I need a new crown?\n\nI would appreciate the professional opinion Dr M: It might be that the post either came loose or fractured. If the post is only loose, it can be recemented, if the seal is good. If the post fractured, but the remaining tooth structure looks okay, a new post and crown can be made. If the post fractured in such a way, that it can't be removed without fracturing the tooth, the best option would be to consider extraction, with replacement of the missing tooth. oceanmd: Thank you, Dr M, for your reply.  \n\nMy dentist suspects the root fracture and referred me to a Periodontist / Implant specialist for a 3-D X-ray.\nI am still experiencing pain on one side of the tooth when using water pick on the side of the tooth.\n\nI am reading about implants now and have a few questions:\n\n1) Do you absolutely always have to use bone graft after you surgically remove a tooth.\n\n2) What is the best material for a bone graft? Dr M: The best material differs based on various factors, such as size and shape of defect, position of tooth in mouth etc.\nIt is however not ALWAYS necessary to place a bone graft. If you did indeed have a root fracture, the extraction might be more of the surgical type and therefore lead to more bone destruction and therefore a graft might be more beneficial. oceanmd: Thank you, Dr M,\n\nWill a 3-D X-ray show if there is a fracture in the root?\n\nCan a body start the bone growth and create its own bone tissue after a tooth extraction? Dr M: The CBCT scan will more accurately be able to tell if there is a fracture, yes.\nIf the extraction is atraumatic and the bone socket is more or less preserved, the body is capable of filling the socket with its own bone yes. oceanmd: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe CBCT scan will more accurately be able to tell if there is a fracture, yes.\nIf the extraction is atraumatic and the bone socket is more or less preserved, the body is capable of filling the socket with its own bone yes.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nThank you for your reply, Dr M,\n\nWill the socket be filled by the existing bone kind of sliding into the hole? Or will my own bone be generating NEW bone tissues? Dr M: You can google bone formation in extraction socket. There are some nice videos that will most likely explain it better than me. But usually the socket fills with granulation tissue, that changes into woven or unmineralized bone, that eventually becomes fully hardened. The adjacent bone does not slide into the socket. It is new bone."

But I think all glass-ionomers convert to trace amount of fluoride, calcium, strontium, and aluminum [electricity conductor = yikes].\n\nIt broke during college 10 years ago; should have been replaced then; I've been sawing down part of it to try to get it off. But it's covering a lot of the tooth, tooth-~10. I now know that these fillings are stronger than regular enamel, which explains why it's hard to get it off and see where it ends and the tooth starts; and why it's damaging the enamel of the tooth below it when I saw down the side with dental sandpaper, because it shifts my bite a little.\n\nI know I should just get it fixed but money or something is keeping me from repairing it, maybe I'm angry/traumatized that it will break again. But that was because I didn't replace my lingual-upper-brace-retainer so my anterior front teeth bunched together breaking the tip of the glass ionomer, releasing whatever is inside it including desensitizing-chemicals, maybe aluminum and fluoride. At night, the resin-glue with the aforementioned characteristics would fill up the left cheeks where the saliva flows, desensitizing other teeth that did not need to be desensitized, blocking certain nerves like my spleen/liver/sexual organs from fully functioning. Now that I've been sanding it down more, the saliva is corroding more surface area but I know what the problem is so I can deal with it better.\n\nFor my questions:\n\n0) do all glass-ionomer fillcings convert into trace amounts of fluoride/aluminum when they wear down? is that why it's wearing more tough on my bottom tooth? or in this case are ruptured/broken and consequently corroded with saliva/citric acid/fruits etc?\n0.5) are all glass-ionomer fillings made with Poly(acrylic acid) which polymerizes? that would explain why my mouth feels like there's goo in it; the resin is polymerizing with the food and nanoparticles, which in turn electrifies that side of my body at night. The resin is also getting on my hands and body when I spit it out.\n\nThis is the article I've been studying about GIC's:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA Review of Glass-Ionomer Cements for Clinical Dentistry\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nThis article is an updated review of the published literature on glass-ionomer cements and covers their structure, properties and clinical uses within dentistry, with an emphasis on findings from the last five years or so. Glass-ionomers are shown to ...\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\twww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n1) could I get it light-cured but without repairing it all the way with new glue/resin/composite/cement? or does it need to be filled over again with some external shell? I heat it up with a spoon and hot water and that stops the corrosion for an hour.  \n2) or just get it filled in again, but then how long will it last? research says composite fillings only last about 3-5 years; I don't want an amalgam 3-surface filling if it has metals in it. maybe the new filling/glaze/composite will last plenty long enough if I also get an upper-lingual-brace to keep teeth from falling inward again if I do things like car-accidents or gymnastics. \n\nYeah I guess I'll just get it fixed soon when I have the cash. I'll leave this here because I want to be more certain about the structure of these fillings for my future health choices. Thank you so much for your feedback."

    "title": "Question about Deep Margin elevation",
    "dialogue": "Jacques: I've just lost a 30 year crown on #15 upper left molar which also has deep decay below the gum line. No pain. My general dentist recommended extraction of the tooth, but I'm looking for an alternative solution. I moved to a new dentist who was willing to refer me to an endodontist and a periodontist. But I've heard that deep margin elevation is a relatively new procedure and that some specialists may lack the necessary skills. My question: Are there dental providers who specialize in deep margin elevation and if so how does one find them? Dr M: Do you have a recent x-ray of the decayed tooth? Deep Margin elevation might not even be an option if the decay is subcrestal. Jacques: Yes, I have an X-Ray taken a few weeks ago showing #14 & #15. I'm new to this Forum so I'm not sure how to upload the image. Jacques: OK, Image attached. Dr M: The best option would be to see a specialist in your case. The root canal treated molar, almost seems like there is root caries present on the distal root, which makes the long term prognosis questionable in my opinion. I would also possible opt for an extraction in that case.  The second molar does have deep decay. In my opinion the tooth would need a root canal before permanent restoration can be attempted, and even then the tooth seems like a periodontally compromised tooth.\nIn cases such as this, you have to think long term and not only short term. It is clear that you have some bone loss present between your teeth, which might be an indication of underlying periodontal disease. I would suggest seeking the opinion of a periodontist. He will do a tooth by tooth analysis and determine which teeth can be saved in the long run, once the perio has been stabilized. Might be better to extract if you are looking at the broader condition of your mouth. Jacques: Thanks very much for your reply.\n\nI have an evaluation referral to an endodontist the day after tomorrow. But just reading the posts in this forum gives me some hesitation about how to interpret his findings. I'm under the impression that the outcome may very well depend on how skilled he is and how cautious or conservative his approach might be.\n\nI take note of your advice about keeping the \"long term\" in mind. Did I mention that I'm 86 and that \"long  term\" has a different ring to it than it did when I was 50? My principal concern at the moment is the preservation of those teeth so I can keep chewing. An excavation of my mouth at this age presents me with a number of difficult prosthodontic problems which may not have easy or affordable solutions not to mention potential healing issues.\n\nSince I was aware that #14 and #15 were compromised by decay at or below the margin, I looked at potential remedies other than extraction, which is why I raised the questions about Deep Margin Elevation and Crown Lengthening. A previous dentist did propose crown lengthening several months ago. In light of the above, my endodontist may recommend the more cautious remedy. I'm not at all sure what to do in that case given my reluctance to extract those teeth. \n\nYou speculated that the root canal treated molar seems to have caries on the distal root. My untrained eye doesn't see it. So far I don't have pain or sensation in either tooth. I suppose the endodontist will test the root canal treated molar (#14) for caries and then also test #15 to determine whether root canal is indicated? In the forum (Matt KW, Verified Dentist), I came across a case like mine which was recommended to be treated with root canal and subgingival amalgam as the most cost-effective solution.   Another case (also recommended by Matt KW) involved treating the decay with an onlay, filling the pulp chamber with amalgam and utilizing a post/core buildup.\n\nI appreciate your help and look forward to your insights. Dr M: Taking your age into consideration, I then tend to agree that alternative options should be considered rather than extraction. The decay  I mentioned is distal of tooth number #14. The endodontist will most likely take a 3D scan to confirm restorability of both teeth.\nDeep Margin Elevation is a well documented procedure for teeth with decay below the gum line, although not all practitioners have the skill to perform this. Unfortunately this means that you will have to bring this procedure up during the consultation with the endodontist, and if he is not comfortable doing it, there is a chance he can refer you to someone in the area that can.\nSubgingival amalgam is also a good option, but to do a proper filling, you will need to ensure adequate marginal seal, and either crown lengthening or deep margin elevation will be required to achieve this seal. Jacques: Thank you so much for your guidance.

When I showed him a diagram, he acknowledged having seen something like it under a different description. I asked whether he knew another specialist who might help me but he demurred.\n\nThe endodontist I saw is part of a network served by the dental insurer which covers me. When I first mentioned DME, he called it a \"heroic\" procedure without much chance of success. It occurred to me (with no real evidence) that network dentists may not be paid enough to use procedures other than those which have been taught in dental schools for decades. \n\nExtracting #14 and #15 is an undesirable outcome for me, but finding someone skilled in DME who would be willing to restore them is more difficult than I anticipated. Today I became aware of a supply house named Garrison Dental which hosted online  webinars on DME so I called them and got a list of their customers in my county. Possibly one or more will know someone who is capable in the field.\n\nThe endodontist's report today said that I was asymptomatic upon presentation. It reminded me that I am lucky not to be in pain from #15 which lost its crown and that I may have \"enough\" time to locate a DME provider with the necessary skills.\n\nThanks again for listening."

    "dialogue": "annamichellexo: I recently got a six unit bridge on my upper teeth (for cosmetic reasons, no infection or root canal or anything. perfectly healthy teeth). My teeth were ground down and the temporary was placed on about five days ago. One of the teeth started hurting a few days ago and upon inspection with a mirror I found that there is a hole (about the size of a sesame seed now, it's about twice the size it was yesterday) on the inside part. The crown is just really thin in that area so I think it just wore away somehow. My question is, should I just leave it alone and keep up with brushing, or should I go back to the dentist and see if they can fix it? I get my permanent bridge in a little under a month, so it's quite a bit of time. Is having a hole dangerous to the tooth since it's been ground down? It hurts but I figure that's just because it's exposed. I don't want to get an infection or something and end up needing a root canal. Sorry if this was all over the place but I really don't know how to describe it any other way. Input/advice would be greatly appreciated! drmins: It would be better if you can consult the dentist and get it covered well. As the enamel are ground,you need to protect the dentin from getting exposed to food debris or other contamination.\n\nStay cool. Keep smiling.\ndr.mins sendicott: How long does it take for a permanent crown to adjust to your bite MattKW: A small hole in a temporary crown may be OK for several weeks. The most likely issues that might arise are tooth sensitivity, or the temporary cement gives way and the temp crown/bridge comes off - so in your case, go back. You won't get an infection.\nHowever, a temporary crown is about the same thickness as a permanent crown, so this may indicate that your tooth was not prepared deep enough. Ask the dentist about this too. If you're getting a PFM bridge then it may not be a problem as these can have a metal backing of as little as 0.3mm. But if you're getting a full ceramic bridge, then it must be at least 1mm thick all over."

If the wisdom tooth is redundant, it's better to take it out while there's something to grab onto. John Morgens: It is not possible to do a filling on a moist area of a wisdom tooth to avoid extraction. If a tooth is decayed or damaged, a filling may be a viable option. However, if the tooth is severely damaged or impacted, extraction may be necessary. During the extraction, the area will be numbed with local anesthesia, and the dentist or oral surgeon will work to remove the tooth as gently and efficiently as possible. After the extraction, gauze will be placed over the area to help control bleeding, and ice packs may be used to reduce swelling. It is important to follow post-operative instructions carefully to promote healing and prevent complications. If you have concerns or questions about the extraction process, it is best to discuss them with your dentist or oral surgeon."

Is this a sign of sensitivity to the PFM or an ill fitted crown? I don't know where to start. I feel like I keep going back to a place that is not listening to me when I say something if wrong. A pic of post RTC and post crown. MattKW: Can't say why. RCT looks reasonable as does crown. I could understand if it was initially too high that it might cause issues, and perhaps even though the bite may have been solved, you may have entered into a pain cycle. Nausea is not directly related to high spots or RCTs or crowns. Maybe go elsewhere for 2nd opinion that the bite is fully corrected. If that checks out, then consider your general doctor. jdent106: Okay. I will get a second opinion and take it from there. The most odd thing that bothers me most, excuse the typo in the title #31 is molar on the right side, when I'm sleeping on the right side I get a jolting sharp pain that wakes me up out my sleep every time its so odd. jdent106: Its looking like a potential tooth fracture unfortunately."

    "dialogue": "worrier: I had a white filling only 2 days ago. It doesn't hurt or anything but I notice there is a small black spot on it. Does this sound normal? I'm not bothered about the cosmetic effect as it's a back tooth but am hoping this isn't something that could affect the health of the tooth and shouldn't be there. Dr M: Might only be a stain. Difficult to say without more information. worrier: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMight only be a stain. Difficult to say without more information.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nThank you for your reply. I thought two days was far too soon for a stain to appear on a band new filling but I'm really hoping that's all it is. John Morgens: It's not uncommon to notice minor color variations or imperfections on a newly placed white filling, particularly within the first few days after the procedure. Here are a few things to consider:\n\nMaterial Settling: The composite material used for white fillings may experience slight changes in color or appearance as it fully cures and hardens over the initial days. This settling process can lead to temporary discoloration.\n\nStaining: External factors such as food and beverages can cause staining on new fillings shortly after placement. Dark-colored foods or drinks may leave temporary marks on the filling's surface.\nResidual Debris: There might have been some residual debris or material on the tooth or filling during the placement, resulting in a small spot. This can happen even when the utmost care is taken during the procedure.\n\nNatural Variations: Natural teeth have variations in color and texture, which can become more apparent when a white filling is placed next to the natural tooth structure.\n\nSince you're not experiencing any pain or discomfort and the spot is on a back tooth, it's likely that this is primarily a cosmetic concern and may not directly impact the health of the tooth. However, to ensure that everything is progressing as expected and there are no underlying issues, it's a good idea to contact your dentist. They can assess the situation, provide guidance, and determine if any adjustments or further actions are needed.\n\nIf the discoloration continues or if you have any concerns about the filling's integrity or your oral health, it's best to consult your dentist. They will be able to offer personalized advice based on their examination of the filling and your tooth. For getting more informations from Dental care professionals please Visit Mylifesmiles. worrier: Thank you for your reply. It's very helpful. I rang my dentist and she explained to me (by phone) that this sounds like a small stain and she is not concerned about this as she has seen me recently but to let her know if it gets bigger or worse. Otherwise she will review it at my next appointment in October."

    "title": "New crown does not feel natural",
    "dialogue": "Eric2005: Three days ago I got a crown (#12) where the  tooth got broken.  The new crown is not painful but it does not feel natural.  Hard to explain - I just feel conscious of it.  The inside of the tooth feels too thick.  In general it feels heavy. As I said, it just doesn't feel natural.  No pain however.  I don't recall having this problem with other crowns.  Is this a matter of getting used to the new crown?  I should point out that the tooth next to to the crown was extracted and an implant put in at the same time that the dentist worked on the mold for the crown.  Then on the last visit when the dentist installed the crown he also extracted another molar in the same area and installed an implant. John Morgens: If your new dental crown does not feel natural and is causing discomfort or doesn't match your bite properly, it's important to address the issue. Here are a few steps you can take:\n\nContact Your Dentist: Reach out to your dentist and let them know about the discomfort and the fact that the new crown doesn't feel natural. Explain the specific issues you're experiencing, such as discomfort, sensitivity, or difficulty biting.\n\nSchedule a Checkup: Your dentist will likely want to examine the crown to assess the fit, alignment, and your bite. They might take X-rays or use other diagnostic tools to ensure that the crown is properly placed and isn't causing any underlying issues.\n\nAdjustment or Refinement: If the crown is not fitting properly or is causing an unnatural sensation, your dentist may need to make adjustments. This could involve refining the crown's shape, adjusting its alignment, or modifying the bite to ensure proper occlusion (how your teeth come together when you bite).\n\nTemporary Discomfort: Keep in mind that it's not uncommon for there to be a brief period of adjustment after getting a new crown. Your mouth and bite might need some time to adapt to the changes. However, persistent discomfort or an unnatural feeling should be addressed promptly.\n\nFollow-Up Appointments: Your dentist might schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your progress and ensure that the issues are being resolved. Be sure to attend these appointments and communicate any ongoing concerns."

All those years ago the tooth snapped at the gum due to football/soccer injury. \nA root filling was performed and the crown was fitted.\nAround 5 years ago the crown came loose and my privately funded dentist refitted it.\nAll was well until recently and it came loose again. I have moved house since then and I am now registered with a national health system (NHS) dentist and he refitted it. I'm sure he did a good job, but it came loose within a few days. He told me that within the NHS I can only have the tooth taken out and a replacement tooth on a pallet fitted.\nThe NHS in the UK is the state partially funded dentist system.\nAs far as I am aware the remaining tooth is sound and it has been there since childhood, albeit only half the size for 45 years.\nI would like to know what my options are for a replacement tooth.\nAnother crown and post? Implant? \nI am 68 year old and that may have a bearing on my choices.\nAny help appreciated.\n\nJohn MattKW: Without an Xray, I can only give an opinion based on my experience. 45 years for an RCT/post/crown is an excellent outcome for a front tooth. When they eventually fail, it often means that some of the remaining natural tooth has fractured off, leaving it even weaker than the original accident. It's likely that another post/crown would fail within a short time; better to consider an implant.

    "title": "New crown gave me headaches, earache",
    "dialogue": "Scorp: I'll try to keep it short. A little backstory.\n\nAbout 7 years ago I got my first crown in my life on my lower-left molar (not the last one, but the one next to it). I had no prior experience with crowns. For the next 3 days the crown had me on my knees in pain. It was horrible pain. And then for the next 12 months I always felt pressure there, and my gums were always sensitive. I didn't know if this was how it's supposed to be, so I lived with it.\n\nThen I changed dentists, and the new dentist removed that crown. Said it was way too big. I felt such a relief immediately, I remember that vividly. And for the next few years I always went to this new dentist, and I did about 10 crowns there. All of these crowns are Cerec crowns. The same-day crowns. This was like a dental office, so I had one person do my root canals, and another one take the print for the crown, make the crown, put the crown in, and cement it. Each person did what they're trained to do. I will say that I never had a single problem there. Not a single infection, not a single bad-fitted crown, not a single anything at all. It was a beautiful thing man.\n\nAbout a year ago I moved to my hometown, and I finally needed a dentist recently because my lower-right molar (not the last one, the one next to it) chipped - a piece broke off. So I looked for dentists online, and I choose one based on google reviews, and how his office looks, and how he looks, and I went there. He cleaned up a tooth and did the root canal. Eventually he took a print for the crown (using the paste method, not digitally). Eventually the crown arrived, and I went to get it put in and cemented. We agreed to leave it in uncemented for 2-3 days to see how I feel. The crown is pretty tight between the adjacent teeth, so it hasn't fallen off once, and it only wiggles a tiny tiny bit, barely noticeable.\n\nSo I come home from the office with my new uncemented crown, and within the hour my head starts hurting, then my ear starts hurting, then my jaw/neck starts hurting a little bit. The crown is in the lower-right side of my jaw, but the pain I was experiencing was on the left side of my head mostly. And this pain remained with me for the next 30 hours or so. Then for the next 30 hours it was less painful, but still it was painful and I was feeling pressure in my head. And today, 7 days later, I still don't feel perfectly. I still feel weird, like pressure in my head (entire head, not just the left side). I went for a run earlier and the crowned tooth/area was pulsating a bit after.\n\nI'll just say, the root canal was done perfectly. No problem with that.\n\nI went and I got an x-ray. Here it is (the crown is the big one in lower-right side):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI did get a second opinion. He looked at the crown, said it looks good, but he can't tell exactly unless I get an xray.\n\nI got a third opinion. She looked at the crown, and the x-ray, and did the bite test with the strips. She told me that \"maybe\" the crown is a bit high, maybe it's a bit too large. But still nothing conclusive!\n\nSo here I am, I guess, looking for a fourth opinion. How does this all sound and look to you?\n\nThank you so much. jdent106: Hi, were you able to get some type of resolve from this? Scorp: No, I didn't. This ruined my life.\n\nAbout 3 months after getting the crown, I got a filling on a tooth above the crown, and I got the crown next to the crowned tooth shaven down a bit after an occlusion check. On that day my headaches stopped \n\nSo I was right, the problem was occlusion.\n\nA few days later while I was eating something, my TMJ (jaw joint) clicked on the right side, and it's all been downhill from there. My jaw joint on the right clicks, my right ear hurts, I have swollen lymph nodes on the right of my neck and under and behind my right ear. My right tonsil is swollen. And since about a week ago I have ringing in my head.\n\nI've been to about 25 doctors. Maxillofacial surgeons, oral surgeons, dentists, ENTs. They're all quite useless. I've had Xrays, CBCTs, and an MRI done. I learned nothing. I have no idea what the problem is, I have no solution. I'm holding on for dear life right now.\n\nI should have removed that crown after a few days and refused to have it put back in. But I didn't. I tried to make it work. I thought I'd find a good dentist and they'd know what the problem is and we can fix it. But no one cares.\n\nSo there you go. Sorry, I wish I had some better news jdent106: Oh no. What kind of crown is installed? In your first post you mentioned you got Cerec crown. Is this new crown different.\n\nI recently got a PFM crown installed on my right lower molar 2 months and the dentist has just been brushing me off with the discomfort. I had shooting pain in my neck and ear. In this final visit I finally got a little relief in the last 3 days because they shaved the top tooth, and the contact has lessened but still odd sensations on this crown. Scorp: I got a zirconium crown.\n\nWell, if your problem is resolved, then you're good now, right? Are you still having discomfort? jdent106: I don't think its resolved because still having sharp pain after a specific point of contact on the crown that still shoots down my neck and ear. Also, get sporadic burning sensations in that specific gum area. Its weird, very uncomfortable, and affecting my sleep. Scorp: Did you have a root canal on that tooth? jdent106: Yes I did, the most odd thing that bothers me most, when I'm sleeping on the right side I get a jolting sharp pain that wakes me up out my sleep every night. Scorp: Are you sure the pain is from that tooth? Could it be from one of the other teeth nearby?\n\nDo you have pain in the tooth on hot/cold? Do you have pain in the tooth if you tap it with something? Does it hurt when you chew? jdent106: Most definitely isolated to that tooth. Tapping it is sensitive and there is a constant subtle throb sitting up right.. The xrays supposedly doesn't see infection. i don't know what to make of it at this point."

Taking the teeth lower involves no new crowns, and is far less expensive, but I worry that my current situation is actually protecting my molars and front teeth from my bruxism, and I might start doing more widespread damage after that happens.

The dentist said filling is not an option due to the size of the divot and my grinding history. I’d prefer an onlay over a crown but his office does not offer an onlay option. I’ve considered finding a dentist who does onlays but first I’m wondering if an onlay would work on this tooth (#19)? \n\nAlso, if a molar is prepped for zirconia, porcelain could the prep still support a gold crown at a later date? Or would the zirconia, porcelain prep remove too much tooth to redo the crown with gold? Thanks.

I'm 40. X-rays attached.\n\nI drank soda and ate candy regularly in my teens and twenties, but I've never had issues with my teeth other than a couple of cavities. I did buy an electric toothbrush a few years ago after the hygienist said my mouth showed signs of acidity. My diet is clean (post-workout sports drink, occasional citrus fruits). I floss and brush daily. This is the most worn tooth in my mouth. \n\nThe tooth has dull ached before. It usually goes away after a few days, week. I assumed it was caused by grinding harder than usual (I wear a custom guard). This time the ache has persisted for over a month. The dentist says the enamel is gone from the chewing surface. He says filling could cause fracture. Also, continued grinding could cause fracture. He is recommending a zirconia, ceramic crown. MattKW: Thank you for the info and pics.\n\nOnce you lose enamel, the teeth start getting sensitive. Yours are not the worst I've seen for a 40yo, but you're still only 1/2-way through your life. Also, it appears as if your front teeth have started chipping.\nIf you still have a post-workout drink, at least rinse your mouth afterwards, and allow 30 mins for saliva to reach protective levels again. Really, I'd prefer you skipped sports drinks altogether (see attached). Also read conclusion to this.\nIf you're eating citrus for the Vit C, then changing to bell peppers (capsicum), strawberries, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower), or white potatoes will meet daily requirements.\nThe cupping on that molar is moderate. It might be simply covered with composite. If there's not enough retention, then some minor drilling might be needed. At your age the pulp (\"nerve\") has receded enough to allow this.\nA crown is way overkill. Just drilling for a crown would potentially disturb the tooth much more than a small filling, and about 5% of crowned teeth need follow-up RCT due to such damage.\nIF... you did do a crown, then gold is the most conservative technique, and also the most tooth-friendly for the opposing tooth to chew. Prepping for zirconia is very destructive, and personally I think they are vastly over-rated.

I appreciate this information and your help.\n\nI will consult another local dentist about this issue and the potential of composite. You mention the possibility of \"minor drilling\" - would that be an onlay?\n\nAlso, out of curiosity, I asked the dentist if a zirconia/ceramic crown could eventually be replaced by a gold crown. His response was, \"Yes, the gold crown would just have to be thicker to accommodate the zirconia/ceramic prep.\" Is that true? Could a tooth that has been prepped for a zirconia/ceramic crown someday support a gold crown?\n\nThanks again. MattKW: Minor drilling - I mean making the existing cupped-out lesion a bit deeper and squarer for a normal small composite filling.\nThe dentist told an inaccurate statement. A gold crown prep is the most minimal thickness of any dental crown material. Monolithic zirconia (solid zirconia) requires slightly more drilling. Layered zirconia (zirconia with a layer of porcelain) or full porcelain requires more thickness again; and is liable to chipping. Porcelain-fused-to-metal is similar to layered zirc (attached 1 with my annotations).\nAlso, gold is gentler to the opposing teeth when chewing, and zirconia is not advised in bruxers (attached 2). David L.: @MattKW, it's very kind of you to help people this way. Thank you. Goldzircstein: @MattKW ,  If a gold prep is the most minimal thickness, would that preclude a gold crown from being modified to go on a tooth that has received a pfm or zirconia prep? MattKW: No, you could place a gold crown on one that had been prepped for PFM or zirconia. The gold could be a bit thicker than necessary, so it would simply cost you more. Goldzircstein: Good to know, thanks for responding. Goldzircstein: How much metal would typically go into a crown for a molar? Is there a way of figuring out what the lab fees for a gold crown would be? There are dental fee guidelines in some places but sometimes they say \" + Lab \" w/o specifying how much that part would normally cost. MattKW: It would depend upon the quality of the gold alloy (preferably high precious) and the amount required (per gram). Unfortunately, the lab wouldn't be able to give an exact quote on the amount required until they had an impression of your prepared tooth and could see how much was required. However, they might be able to give you a range of usual costs.\nMost people want yellow high precious (yellow gold); my lab used Bego PontoLloyd G at 84.4% Au (see attached). You can see that in this brand, white high precious kicks in when the gold content drops below 80% Au. To qualify as a high precious there must be 60% noble metal, of which more than 40% must be gold. \nFor a very good layperson overview of dental alloys, go to here. Goldzircstein: Hello again, and thank you for your invaluable assistance. I've heard that many dentists in North America use labs that are in far away Asian countries so as to be able to make more profit on the crown. The profit part doesn't really bother me but is there any way to be certain of the quality control? Are the dental prosthetics labs regulated with transparent oversight? Does the dentist and/or patient have a means of verifying that the crown is made of what it is supposed to be made of? MattKW: Ask your dentist if they use a local lab.  Ask to see the itemised invoice if you want to check on the gold alloy used."

    "title": "Crown for molar: gold alloy versus lithium disilicate, zirconium, etc.",
    "dialogue": "dentalquestion: I have a molar with a large 30+ year old amalgam filling, and there now appear to be cracks in it (a known risk of amalgam filling metal expansion from heat).  It may eventually need a crown...\n\nFor crowns, my understanding is that gold alloy is generally the longest lasting and requires the least removal of tooth material.  Are there any disadvantages of gold alloy versus other crown materials besides appearance (which is not a concern for me for a molar, since no one else outside a dental office will see it)?  Is there any difference in how likely it is to fall off?  Are other crown materials less opaque to X-rays, and does that make any difference in the usefulness of X-rays to detect problems under the crown? MattKW: Firstly, let's dispel the myth that amalgam causes cracking. It certainly doesn't cause it from heat expansion. It can weaken teeth more than composite because amalgam doesn't bond (glue) to teeth and sometimes need more tooth structure removed than a composite. As a teacher in clinical dentistry, I encourage students to try amalgam in selected cases; it is sometimes much better than amalgam; unfortunately it is grey!\nGold alloy is my preference for 2nd molars. Minimal preparation and has similar wear characteristics to enamel of opposing teeth. Monolithic zirconia (not layered zirconia) can also be used in a similar fashion. but... crowning a tooth causes indirect damage and there is ~8% chance of the nerve dying. If that happens, then it is easy to cut through gold alloy and do an RCT, and keep the crown. If you cut through zircionia (really tough!), then you will have to replace the crown. If I ever need a crown, it will be a gold alloy.\nThe glue that holds either a gold crown or a zirconia is about the same amount of grip. The glue should not be the determining factor in holding on a crown. With special treatment it is possible to get a better grip on zirconia than gold, BUT the preparation of the crown with fairly parallel sides is more important. Most crowns I have seen come off have been where they were over-prepared (too tapered).\nRadio-opacity doesn't really matter. If you develop decay under any crown, it will be at the margin where the crown meets natural tooth. Decay will go under the crown and also below the crown onto the root surface. So, it will be visible on the root surface anyway, and that's enough reason to assume the same amount is under the crown, and requires the removal of the crown. dentalquestion: Would lithium disilicate be similar to zirconia in the above (and similarly less desirable than gold alloy for molar crowns)? MattKW: Lithium disilicate should not be used for molars, only up to 2nd premolars. It has a better translucency and \"look\" than gold or zirconia, but much weaker."

    "title": "Root Canal Through Crown. Any Alternatives?",
    "dialogue": "sunshower21: The tooth in question has already been drilled to a nub and a temporary crown put on top. No root canal was done. It started giving me pain all of a sudden when I would drink coffee and would last for an hour. I called my dentist thinking there might be a crack in the crown. He prescribed me antibiotics and it actually worked. I go in today, took an xray, there was no crack and he tells me he wont be able to do the root canal bc it would damage the crown and my insurance wont pay for a new one. He said I'd have to go to a specialist to get a hole drilled in my crown and do the root canal that way (which would take 2 hours) instead of taking it off. I'm a little angry at the whole insurance issue. Has anyone been in a similar situation and had to get a root canal through your crown? Is there any easier alternative? MattKW: So, do you still have the temporary crown in place or has the permanent one been cemented? Do you have xrays to show us? sunshower21: The temporary is still in place. Unfortunately, I do not have an xray MattKW: If it's only a temporary crown, then it's made of plastic, and glued on with a temporary cement. You haven't paid for the completed crown and therefore haven't claimed through your insurer. \nAn endodontist would simply remove or drill through the temporary, then you can get the real crown cemented. There won't normally be much change to the underlying tooth, so if the permanent crown has been made and is waiting for you, it should fit on easily after the RCT is finished."

I am supposed to have an Esthetic screw-retained Zirconia Crown but the paperwork states Porc/Ceramic Crown.\nWhen I see the crown, how can I tell that it really is Zirconia?\nThank you very much MattKW: Ceramic is a general term encompassing silicate ceramics (of which feldspathic porcelain is a subgroup), polycrystalline ceramics (of which zirconia ceramics is a subgroup), and resin matrix ceramics. So, the paperwork is a bit ambiguous, and you won't be able to tell just by looking at it. Ask to see the lab invoice which should have more details including a brand name. oceanmd: Thank you very much. I was told that there is no special code for Zirconia, so they had to use Porcelain/Ceramic code D6058.\nIs it unusual to ask for a lab invoice? MattKW: That sound fine. It would be unusual, but you are within your rights. For example, with implants I make sure to give the patient all the barcodes and related info so they know they are getting genuine parts, and can easily show to another dentist if any issues arise - I won't live forever! oceanmd: Thank you so very much for your help. I will see if I can diplomatically ask for the crown invoice."

    "dialogue": "LSxBakakos: Hoping to hear some positive news lol\n10 weeks ago I had 5 teeth extracted(wisdoms plus another) and one bone graft done. I had been seen at 1&2 week intervals. No infection was present, however I did have irritation but I was reassured i was healing great. I'm 10wks post op, have a part of gum tissue that seems to be alternating between a light reddish/pink and normal gum color. My camera makes it a little bit more red looking than in person. I am a smoker, however I believe I hit the graft site with a piece of crust the other day. When I got home last night it looked inflamed I had dabbed a tissue on it and saw a tiny bit of pink. Other than one time when I had caught a non absorbed particle has it bled, normal brushing normally does not seem to have any affect on it unless I still am brushing too rough. I'm paranoid with healing after I had a nasty infection prior to the surgery. I'm hoping it's just my mind and that I'm in good shape as far as healing but would like an experts advice. The few websites I've seen has similar images to 3,4,5mo intervals however I've only seen one other with this kind of pigment LSxBakakos:  LSxBakakos: Update. I do believe where the bump was a tiny part of graft particle pushed its way out, this is how it's looked so far today. Spoke with a friend's wife who was a dental tech, she said it didn't look infected, but did look like it was irritated. Also was told salt water rinses shouldn't be longer than 2wks or irritation will occur, I've been doing them for the last 10...\n\nStill would prefer a doctor's opinion\n\nThanks in advance MattKW: Looks OK. There is no problem with continuing salt water rinses; it's just a mild antiseptic. However, smoking is a risk factor in healing, and also for the longevity of implants. LSxBakakos: I can't even explain how greatful I am for your response, truthfully, thank you thank you thank you! That's also good to know I can continue salt water, since I've stopped using it and went to an alcohol free mouthwash the graft has less of a \"raw\" feeling to it. Also the spot where it keeps changing color(did it last night as well) is that just pigment or granulation tissue changing? As far as smoking I've recently been trying to cut down, I know it's not a cigarette/juul but regardless it's not a good habit to keep LSxBakakos: Sorry, tried to edit but it wouldn't allow. I meant it is not a cigarette, and is a juul, but I'm sure just as bad MattKW: If it contains nicotine, then unfortunately it's bad for gums, healing, and implants. \nAnd we still don't know the long term effects of the other ingredients in vaping yet, but it's not looking good.

The other one proposed to take images of the mouth and see if an implant is immediately possible. MattKW: It is generally assumed that by 18yo the face (esp the upper jaw) had ceased growing. The risk is that placing implants at an earlier age may allow the bone to overgrow the implant, so that the fake tooth starts to be left behind as the growing bone moves the real teeth downwards. The attached 2019 article 1 reviews this concept in patients <18yo, and shows cases of implants as early as 10yo. If you look at the parts I've highlighted, the successful studies (<10% failure rate with a long follow-up?) with young children involve small number of patients. \nThe second study article 2 shows that studies suggest that facial growth usually stops at 18yo, but in some people may continue afterwards, and there was no absolutely reliable way of determine when facial growth stops.\nMy daughter also missed growing her upper lateral incisors, and I forced her to wait till she was 21yo before implant placement. She is now 35yo without complications. Maybe I could've had them placed at 18? Maybe her growth might've continued after 21yo, and she was just lucky?

If there is indeed leakage and it is left untreated, the decay could spread and lead to further tooth destruction.

About 5-10% of crowned teeth end up needing root canal therapy (RCT) because of 1. and 2.\nAll ceramic crowns require greater cut-back than a good gold crown, so there is more damage to the tooth than a gold crown.\nBonding to zirconia is more tricky than other ceramics (or gold)\nThere may be other issues e.g. poor margins\nIf a crown isn't starting to settle within 2 weeks, I get concerned."

A crown will not get much grip on the broken side (lingual). If you try another gold crown as on the adjacent tooth (I love gold crowns), it may well fail. Even building up some sort of core (pin retention?) is not much better.\nYou need a bonded ceramic crown (or onlay encompassing the buccal cusps) and still cross your fingers for the long term.

Can you please elaborate why you suggest a ceramic crown is recommended over a gold crown in this instance?  (Is bonded ceramic a 3D printed/Cerec type of crown?)\n\nThanks MattKW: Gold crowns are not glued onto a tooth.  Although a cement is used, the cement (glue) may stick (adhere) to the tooth, but will not stick to gold. So, in most situations with gold crowns, we want a lot of tooth structure with parallel sides so that the grip is more frictional than adhesive. The gold crown on your 2nd molar will be \"glued\" like that, and that's how most gold crowns are done. Similarly for zirconia crowns (which are a non-silica-based ceramic), it is technically very difficult to get a \"glue\" that sticks to the zirconia, so you want as much tooth structure as possible. \nYour fractured molar has very little real tooth left, so you would want a silica-based ceramic or a resin-crown which will allow a \"glue\" to stick reliably both to the tooth AND the crown. CEREC crowns are typically zirconia, although I think they make a resin type too. The main advantage to a CEREC crown is that it can be made on the same day as the preparation of your tooth - that's it, no special physical qualities.

Modern technology involves incredibly durable build-up materials (so I'm told).  In my mind I picture leaving the buccal side largely in tact as an underlying lateral sheer stabilizer, with the lingual side built up, so under a gold crown it shouldn't fail from lateral forces.  And the crown would have friction from buccal tooth material on one side, with build-up material on the lingual to hold it in place.  Again, this is me knowing nothing but generalities, but hopefully I explained that adequately.  I do understand the notion of wanting the best adhesion possible, but am still not quite following why a gold crown would be more likely to fail in this scenario than other teeth I've cracked above the gumline.  Unless a build-up does not provide sufficient tooth substitute for friction to hold  a crown in place over the longer haul.  Is that basically the concern in my case with using a crown other than a silica-based or resin ceramic crown? MattKW: A gold crown made for tooth fractures above the gumline can be great. You need a fair amount of tooth all around to take the lateral forces of chewing, because there will be no bonding. Yes, if there's not a lot of tooth structure above the gum you can compensate by building up a composite core, but the main strength for an unbonded gold comes from whatever natural tooth you can use. In your case, you have NO natural tooth wall on the lingual side.\nIf you did a core build-up before making this crown, the buildup would either be composite with pins(?) (bonded) or amalgam with pins (unbonded). Pins won't really help in such a big fracture, so I wouldn't bother. \nSo, you might do a bonded composite core, then shape it to take a gold crown. The strength still depends on the bonding of the core - no advantage, just an unnecessary step.\nYou are no better off (and arguably slightly worse off) than simply using a solid bonded ceramic, a lab-made bonded composite crown, or a CEREC bonded resin crown.\nSo much depends on a good bond across that large fractured area. There's still a moderate risk that it will all fail. If this tooth was already dead and root-filled, I would extract and do an implant. You have an option to try and save the tooth only because it is still alive. SonicExplorer: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tA gold crown made for tooth fractures above the gumline can be great.

I recall they said the new bonding materials are so strong they can almost act as a tooth by themselves. But I suppose that doesn't necessarily mean it bonds well to the tooth...which is what I think you are trying to convey as one of the main issues with considering the gold crown vs. another type that is better suited for bonding in my case. \n\nThank you (and Dr. M) for sharing your excellent knowledge and insight. It is tremendously helpful, and I'm sure it will help other forum members who read this discussion in the future.\n\nSonic SonicExplorer: Correction, meant to type \"I recall they said the new buildup materials are so strong they can almost act as a tooth by themselves.\" MattKW: No problem. It just seems like doubling-up unnecessarily to bond the crown to a bonded core. It's really just the bond of the core, or the bond of a ceramic crown directly to the tooth, that will ultimately determine your chances. And keep the cusps flat-ish."

    "dialogue": "Michael Thomas: Hi,\n\nI had a crown placed on a molar (bottom left). After three months of headaches my night guard cracked. The dentist said the crown was too high and filed it down. The headaches have stopped but my (once even) bite now feels much heavier on the right side. \n\nIs it possible a crown being too high for three months could change, damaged my bite?\n\nWould having the crown redone fix the problem or would it require braces, etc.? \n\nThank you. Dr M: Good day\n\nI don't think it is necessary for a new crown and/or braces. The dentist most likely took the crown out of your bite, which now makes it feel like you are biting more on the right, than the left. This was done due to you having 3 months of constant pain. I would suggest getting a new bite plate made for now. Chances are you will get use to this new \" normal\"."

My dentists haven't been the best ones so far for sure. I lost one tooth next to the left upper incisor because it was badly decayed so the dentist told me I required a root canal, but he didn't protect what was left of the tooth with a crown. One day my tooth literally broke to pieces, I had to wait 5 days till a clinic took out the remains of my tooth out of my gum.\n\nEver since I waterfloss 2x a day religiously, never miss a day. Brush 2x or 3x a day for around 4 minutes each. All 3 surfaces of every tooth. Floss the lower arch with string floss. Cannot yet floss the upper arch with any sort of floss other than waterfloss, I have an upcoming appointment with the dental hygenist so I'll ask her to show me how I could do that because my mouth is very narrow, small and I can't get the angle right.\n\nMy teeth still keep on hurting almost every day for a couple of hours even tho I really take as much care of them as possible. I also require jaw surgery because my jaws are very recessed, small, underdeveloped, just like my bite. My parents badly neglected my health when I was a kid by not putting me on braces, probably I wouldn't have anywhere near the issues I am having every day had they been good parents.\n\nWouldn't it be best to take out all 26 of them, replace them with 2 all-on-4 implants (upper and lower arch) so with that not only would I get my bite back (I can't chew with most of my teeth, only with my maxillary and mandibular molars in the back on the sides) but also I could just get straight into the jaw surgery without wasting 2 years on braces. Again, I should have got braces back when I was 12 but my parents messed me up real good. If only I could turn back the wheels of time.\n\nNeedless to say, I have completely changed my diet ever since. Take every vitamin, mineral, eat a dairy-rich diet, lean meat as well, very very minimal sweets and energy drinks if any at all on most days.\n\nAlso many of my teeth are rather loose or at least feel that way according to my latest dentist.\n\nPlease, any input, thoughts, recommendations would be GREATLY appreciated, thank you very much in advance, heartfelt."

    "title": "What happens when a filling is too low?",
    "dialogue": "Kels_: I recently had several fillings done. however, I am thinking of a back molar (back left) the filling is slightly too low. Suddenly I am feeling like my front right upper tooth and one of the front bottom right teeth are hitting and it hurts but NO work was done around there. I also feel a little edge where the filling is not flush with my tooth on the back left the tooth is higher its slight but I can feel it with my fingernail. definitely is not high on the back two molars there had fillings.\n\na week prior to the back molar fillings the same dentist replaced two fillings in my upper molars one on each side of my jaw. that had caused bite issues as well, I had one adjustment the next day it felt high and the following adjustment the day he did the lower molars. he had to adjust my right premolar to stop them from hitting a new spot.\n\nIt's been now nearly 2 solid weeks since my bite is wrong (and seems to change to some extent) and I am not sure what it should feel like anymore but I know it didn't hurt anywhere at all before. I did say I was concerned about doing more work before my bit was good. and now so many things have changed I'm just confused. I also now have a mild dull ache on my upper right molars one of them had a filling replaced 2 weeks ago but I had no dull ache that I am aware of until this week after he did the lower left back molars. (Perhaps the area he adjusted was caused more discomfort I didn't notice the ache but I think I would have) \n\nSo my un-education theory is that the lower left molar filling or fillings are slightly too low causing extra pressure on my right upper jaw as well the front right teeth. It is extremely hard to find any information on a bite being off because of a low filling... Is this a thing? What does this sound like?\n\nThe fillings are composite, if the filling is low can it be added too? what should happen if it's low?\n\nI am supposed to go in on Monday morning. If he wants to adjust the high teeth that had no work to them and just smooth the edge of the back tooth is that something that is ok? I am worried that at this rate every tooth is going to be slightly ground down to make my bite good. I had braces as a kid and prior to this work, I had no complaints of pain or toothaches. I don't wanna cause more harm. Kels_:  MattKW: You wouldn't notice it if a standard filling as you show was too low. A high filling is immediately noticeable because the tooth will take more force than expected, but is easily adjusted and will provide immediate relief. There is likely to be some mild discomfort for up to 2 weeks after a fresh filling. Composite fillings are much more technique-sensitive and likely to cause post-op sensitivity than amalgams, and continued sensitivity after a composite may require redoing the filling, or replacing with an amalgam. I've seen many patients where they have had multiple useless \"adjustments\" after composites rather than having it redone. Kels_: It must be a high spot but they did so much work it got very confusing, it almost feels like a marble in that tooth and is creating soreness as my teeth just don't fit right and slide weirdly or something there's just too much tension I guess. like a tiny marble is in that tooth somehow I already had adjustments and it's still there I am not sure how he can't find the high spot or the cusp ridge that is running wrong. he cleaned up some margins he said and to try that but it's still not right. it the second molar on the right top."

Thisbites: Im guessing this is old news, but i can attest for myself anyhow that if all is well with your crown and the fit etc. and no pain or discomfort you can have temp cement on your crown no problem for 3 months.\nI have a lot stress around my teeth, and had the same concern. I still am ok with my crown having temporary cement and have not seated it w permanent yet. i dont even want to as it rattles me, and do not want to open up another pandoras box.\nI personally wouldnt worry about it as long as it feels ok. Scorp: I'm having a bit of an issue at the moment. I've been running with a permanent crown for 7 days, uncemented.\n\nWe agreed with the dentist to leave it uncemented for 2-3 days, to see how I feel. I'm so glad I did, because the crown gave me huge headaches and earaches \n\nSince I already paid for the stupid crown, I can't go to get one done to my old dentist in a different city (I never had problems when he did my crowns). My old dentist took the print for the crown digitally and made it on the same day, and it was always a perfect fit. My current dentist did the traditional \"paste in your mouth\" to take the print for the crown, and it's just not as good of a fit.\n\nIn any case, I'm probably going to have this new dentist shorten the crown a bit more, in case my problem comes from the crown and the tooth above it touching too much. And then I'm gonna have him do a temporary cement of the crown. If the crown continues to cause pressure in my head, in the end, I'm gonna throw it away and go get a new crown made where they do it digitally.\n\nSo yeah, temporary cementation is good for some cases in my opinion"

Usually when the crowns are designed, they are designed in such a way to prevent them from \" biting\" too hard on the opposing teeth. Your bite is also checked by your dentist, once the final crowns are cemented.\nOver time, there can be some wear on the opposing dentition, depending on the condition of the opposing teeth as well as the movement of your jaw and teeth during function."

MattKW: Feldspathic porcelains were the mainstay of crown for many years along with metal-fused-to-metal (\"VMKs\"). Nowadays there is a much greater variety of ceramics available. Yes, zirconia is very strong, but requires more tooth removal and is damnably hard to adjust or remove if the need arises - I avoid using zirconia. If you ask most older dentists which material they'd prefer, you'll find we often have a penchant for gold crowns on molar teeth. They can be made very thin with fine margins, and have excellent wear and strength characteristics. We've seen them last a very long time (up to a lifetime) with the usual maintenance."

The tooth it replaces was lost about 10 years ago so I do understand that I need to get used to have a tooth there again.  However, the teeth seem so big - I keep biting my tongue when I eat and sometimes when I speak.  There seems to be “pressure” in the bridge which I can feel if I push it with my tongue or try to chew anything harder than cake or vegetables and also when I use Tepe brushes on teeth near it.  (The bridge is the last 3 teeth on top right).  I cannot chew meat at all.  I can’t say it hurts but it does cause an uncomfortable sensitive feeling.  As I said I knew I would have to get used to it but I did think they would feel like my own teeth but they do not, they feel like large lumps of plastic in my mouth which get in the way when I try to eat and I am constantly trying to move them out of the way.  Logic tells me that an impression was taken of the teeth that were there previously so the crowns should be exactly the same size and shape.  My dentist says that the bite is perfect and I can close them together without any problem but if I chew anything substantial there is discomfort.  I am waiting until two weeks have passed before I return to the dentist but in the meantime would be interested to hear others experiences as at present I am not sure whether it is me and a settling in period or not.

I got the filling about 1 month ago and the first couple days I did not feel sensitive to hot or cold but chewing on it felt a bit tender. Oddly enough, after a few days it felt better to chew on but started sensitivity to cold but very slight.  The cold sensitivity slowly grew until it was pretty sensitive a couple weeks after the filling.  If something cold hit it, it would feel very sensitive but as soon as the cold was moved away, it felt almost immediately fine.  However by about 3 weeks after filling, once the cold was removed it immediately felt a lot better, but it would have a dull ache for a couple minutes and then feel fine.\n\nAbout 4 days ago hot tea started to have the same effect as the cold (but not as bad), so yesterday I went back to the dentist.  They did the paper test and slightly adjusted my filling because it was a little high and marked the paper blue.  They said the filling was fine and that maybe I would need a root canal because it was a big filling.  I do not want to rush into a root canal and wanted extra eyes on the before and after for others to hear the situation.  Seeing if maybe it is worth waiting awhile and if it stays sensitive to try to get the filling re-done?  If you look at the before and after (see attached 'Post-Filling_circled'), I notice an area below the filing where it looks to me is the edge of the cavity, could some of the cavity have been missed?  I pointed it out to the dentist but they said that was nothing.\n\nI had never gone to this dentist before and they had a very hard time at certain stages of the filling and reaching the spot.  At some point I think they got their glove stuck while trying to position the (Matrix?). It seemed like the glove was stuck there for awhile and I could see the dentist looking at the assistant and vice versa with an 'aw crap' look on both of their faces.  Anyway, this did make me feel less confident and wonder if maybe bacteria could have gotten under the filling or the dentist could not adequately access the area to get the entire cavity?\n\nYour advice would be appreciated to guide me on next steps and if it is worth avoiding a root canal more.  I have a bad experience with root canals because my 4 front bottom teeth were knocked back in a sports injury and needed root canal.  Many years later they got infected and I was told by a clinic to do apicoectomies which were done very aggressively and did not work and also made my gums feel weird and scar tissue feels stiff. \n\nThat same clinic wanted to pull them and give me partial dentures.  I went to a very reputable endodontist that said it was a shame that I didn't see him first and that he could see a missed canal that probably caused the problem for all 4 of the teeth and if treated would have remedied the area, but that now since the other place took over half of the below tooth structure of all those teeth, I cannot keep any of them.  I am actually just healing from a special bone graft with special bone protein just for hopes that enough bone can grow for getting an implant supported bridge instead of dentures.  So I am extra bummed about this cavity because I feel like one very long tooth saga was about to come to an end as I am hoping to get the 2 implants for the bridge soon.  Now I only have one section of my mouth that I can comfortably eat with.  So even though normally a cavity is not so big of a deal, this is just kind of feeling extra depressing for me.\n\nI also looked back on older x rays and I can see this cavity, only smaller.  I always went to the dentists that took my not so great insurance and now I wonder if they told me the treatment best for me or just ones that they would cover or something.  I do not know why no one saw the cavity for years.  I also was told apicoectomies were a minor tiny procedure and was told it was better than re-treatments, which is what I originally came to them asking about.  They wound up taking half of my teeth and leaving a defect in my jaw bone which another endodontist said was not even necessary.\n\nSorry I kind of went off topic.  I guess while typing this is my entire mouth situation is getting to me.  Anyway for the main cavity issue, just a couple last notes that are maybe helpful:\n-My bite never felt very off but I do remember touching the surface of the filling with my tongue and it felt kind of flat. A few days in, about the same time sensitivity came, it felt a bit more concave.\n-Only one specific area is very sensitive.  I tested it with a frozen corn.  I could place the corn all around the tooth and nothing, but if I placed it at this one spot on the side looking out of my mouth down by the gums t would be pretty intensely sensitive.\n-The sensitivity is sometimes worse after I wake up which makes me feel like maybe the filling is high and while I am sleeping I am bothering it more than when I am awake and actively trying to be careful with it.\n\nThanks a lot for your time\n\np.s. This dentist also said that I needed scaling, which I was warned about by the dental clinic who did my apicoectomies.  I was on Chlorhexidine for like 2 months which is way longer than you are supposed to from what I've read.  They said it is fine but I may need special cleaning due to the long use Chlorhexidine causing tartar build up, or something like that.  Is that something that can be seen in an x-ray to confirm that I need?  If it can be seen in an x-ray I can post it in a different topic if it does not count as this topic, thanks."

    "dialogue": "Owl333: I had perfect teeth my whole life: strong, no cavities. My dentist retired and another one took over. I pointed out a tooth where there was a gap between it and the next tooth, and she looked at it and pronounced it severely decayed. No ex-ray or anything. Being an idiot, I let her drill into my tooth. Her filling increased the gap between my two teeth. It was also slightly too high, meaning that my tooth squidged into my gum every time I ate.\n\nThe next dentist I went to tried to replace the filling, but I reacted too sensitively to the drilling. He asked me if I felt air blowing on my gum, and I did, so I said Yes. He then told me that I needed a root canal, even though my tooth didn't hurt at all (but did feel as if it were on an unstable surface due to the squidging).\n\nI went to an endodontist who, when I said my tooth didn't get numb during the drilling, decided that I didn't need whatever tests she was going to perform and that she needed to conduct the root canal right away.\n\nNow, I have a crowned tooth after two procedures I think were unnecessary. And my current dentist is telling me the tooth will not last through another crowning should this one go bad. I'm absolutely terrified. Is it true that a root-canaled tooth can be too whittled down and fragile for re-crowning? If I have to get an implant, how risky and awful will this be? I'm a 45-year old female and have a family history of osteoporosis. I'm in a frenzy thinking of how stupid I was to not do more due diligence, and how much I stand to lose in money, health, and peace of mind. honestdoc: Once the tooth gets a root canal, the strength of the tooth and root greatly diminishes.  It is unpredictable how much damage will be underneath the crown should you need to replace it.  You can still get a cavity under your crown so be very thorough with brushing and flossing and avoid sugary/acidic/creamy beverages."

I've been experiencing constant pain and discomfort, enough to keep me up for the last three nights in a row. For the last 3 days when I put any pressure on the tooth even very light pressure I feel intense pain, on a scale from 1 to 10 I would say a definite 10/10. However today the pain is less intense, I would say 7/10 when I put pressure on the tooth and just slight discomfort when no pressure is on the tooth, I feel like it is improving. \n\nI am currently 33 years of age, no known medial issues in the past or present though my mother has Diabetes.\n\nWhat would you recommend as the best course of action? I would like preventative measures to be taken ASAP on the crack to prevent it getting worse. Many thanks in advance! Dr M: Good day\nThe most important factor is to determine how deep the crack goes. If the pain is subsiding, it might be a good sign, but it could also be a bad sign, since the nerve might actually be dying. In such a case, the pain will first go away, and then gradually come back as an abscess is formed. \nThe best option would be to go see a dentist. He will have to follow the crack and restore it with a normal filling if possible. If the crack extends into the nerve, a root canal is indicated. In severe cracks, the tooth will need to be extracted. Will2022: Thank you so much for the advise. Very informative. Does the level of pain indicate the deepness of the crack? The pain was unbearable with even the slightest pressure on the tooth. Do the two xrays show if any of my teeth need a root canal? Is it possible to see this from just the X-rays alone? Would a filling help at all or will it just make the crack worse? Would you suggest a crown or just doing nothing for now?

    "dialogue": "DaveDogge: I've Just received a dental restoration quote for 31.5K euros, (see photos) is suggested work appropriate ?  £27,000 is a lot of money to me and the dentist I saw gave me no alternative to the option I describe below, note that I am in my late 40s:\n\nIf you look at the photos posted, my lower four front incisors are worn down like tiny stumps almost at the gum line, I have no enamel on them above the gum line and it's just detina that is exposed, the upper incisors look chipped and worn but at least they have vertical length. I've obviously suffered from teeth gnashing (bruxism) and foolishly have not been to see a dentist in decades.\n\nThe dentist I saw suggested that he does root canals on the lower front 4 incisors, increases the exposed crown length of these by cutting away the gum and then  creating a bridge for all 4 (after I did look at the pros and cons of bridges), that's all fair and good and I thought that was  probably all that was required.\n\nBUT after second consultation with the dentist he showed me a physical model of my teeth and told me  that if he were to install the bridge for the front bottom 4 incisors then he would have to put metal crowns on ALL my back molars BECAUSE the introduction of the bridge would lift the back molars 2-3mm (thus creating a  2-3mm gap for all the back teeth) and when I eat my food using the back molars the food would somehow go from the back of the mouth to the front of my mouth (or something along those lines) and wear down the front incisors in no time as they would be doing the lion's share of the tearing of food. So he proposed metal crowns for practically all my back molars (he surprisingly suggested gold, which I know is the best but still - high cost) with porcelain 'side' crowns to hide the metal crowns on the molars.  He also suggested porcelain veneers for some of the front teeth and I asked him on the spot that these were a cosmetic addition only aren't they ? and he said in my case 'not just cosmetic', right now I am assuming he wants them for the front top chipped teeth.\n\nWhat caused me to go to the dentist in the first place is that I ate a corn on the cob and one of my lower incisors started to hurt constantly and it then went away after 2 days, I was told only via the 2nd consultation that it was a minor infection when I saw them the 1st time (although the first time they told me it wasn't an infection). Also note that I had the same pain in the same tooth 19 months before - again after eating a corn on the cob, which only lasted 3 days.\n\nQuestion:\nI am assuming that for the amount of work (a full overhaul of the teeth in my mouth and 6 months work it's about the right price but is so much work necessary for the back molars, he claims that these are worn down also (hence the 2-3mm gap he was talking about) but I have no problem using them; could he not just make the lower bridge height for the 4 front lower incisors 2-3mm lower so that they are more level with the molars at the back as they are ?????\nAfter my first consultation I thought it would be 4 lower incisor root canals, crowns for all of them and maybe some repair work on the two principal upper incisors ...\n\nAnyone have any thoughts on this ???

    "dialogue": "i500: Hello, \n\nI have been having a lot of issues ever since I got a crown earlier this year. I think the crown was too big and tall and that caused me to crunch my teeth while I sleep at night. The crown is on upper back tooth on the right. I also had pain on the crowned tooth from the day I got the crown prep done and the pain never went away to this day. The pain was focused around the crown at first, but then it spreaded to the entire upper teeth, then to the lower teeth (more like lower jaw bone). I went to many dentists/dental specialists (general, periodontist, orthodontist) but they all told me that it is probably due to the uneven bite. \n\nI had my crown adjusted and my dentist says it is not touching anymore when I bite down, but the bite still feels off. It seems like teeth on both sides of the crown are touching the lower teeth, but it does not feel like pre-crown bite. And I still crunch my teeth during sleep (I can feel pain/soreness when I wake up). Also, those two teeth do not hurt, but the crown does hurt. Could you please let me know what it can be that is causing the pain? Is it possible that the crown is too wide/tight and it is causing the pain? I noticed that sometimes flossing gets really tight there.\n\nAdditional info: The crowned tooth had root canal done by a specialist before the crown was cemented and my dentist says x-ray shows no issue.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\nThank you."

Intermittent sharp shooting pains upon chewing. Secondary caries identified underneath amalgam. No fractures were identified. Composite filling placed seven months ago.\n\nSince having the composite filling done, I have experienced pain only on biting something hard on the filling or when directly pushing against the filling and upon release with the fingernail. There’s no pain on touching the tooth itself with the finger. \n\nInitially for the first three months, the pain was a very acute, short lived, sharp and shooting type of pain, with no dull ache or throbbing and was most prevalent in the mornings. There is no discomfort with cold, hot or sweet things. However there was a brief period in which the tooth was sensitive to cold water which started two months ago and resolved by itself after a few weeks. \n\nI have used sensitivity toothpaste for the last several months which has alleviated the acute, sharp and shooting pain into a milder shooting soreness upon chewing.\n\nMy dentist mentioned there is no obvious fracture line in the tooth. The filling is also not high, and has been adjusted out of the occlusion after I sought a review from my dentist one month after the procedure.\n\nThe tooth is not tender to percussion and responds normally to cold test. There is no pocketing around it. \n\nAside from a possible fractured tooth, I am thinking it could be polymerization shrinkage as my dentist placed the composite in bulk. My dentist also did not use any irrigation in drilling out the caries so may have irritated the nerve at the time. \n\nI have attached a copy of x-rays taken before the replacement (with amalgam) and one month after the composite filling. I have noticed a dark line from the tooth centre and was wondering if that is a sign of a poor bond or nothing at all?\n\nThank you,\n\nJono"

    "dialogue": "VallartaLad: Should I replace an old large filling on #18, or replace it with a crown?\n\nHave attached Xray images (along with neighbor #19, which had an AstraTech implant and zirconia crown put in this past winter and spring).  The symptoms improved but didn't go away.  I still get some occasional (and rarely severe/long-lasting) pain in my lower left when eating something chewy, cold or sweet.  My newly acquired general dentist, who installed the #19 crown, thinks #18 could be at issue now.  Its old filling may have a small leak or perhaps there is a small crack which isn't yet too significant.\n\nHe says I could:\na)  Go to endodontist; have an eval and probably a root canal, and then come back for a crown.\nb)  Skip (a) for now.  Just have the general dentist put in a crown.  That might trigger the need for a root canal but odds are it would not.  It might stop the symptoms for good.  If later it needs a root canal, just drill through the zirconia crown and patch it.  (Is it that easy with solid zirconia, which I know can be quite hard?).\nHe didn't mention a 3rd option of just replacing the old filling with a new one and I didn't think to ask.  But I thought I'd ask on this forum as a possible 3rd option.  That seems the most conservative route certainly.\n\nAny thoughts? Dr M: Good day\n\nReplacing the filling with another filling, or even perhaps an amalgam filling, might be a good option to consider as a first option. It does look like there might be some micro-leakage mesially, which could lead to sensitivity. Crown placement is more destructive, so I would consider this only after replacing the filling. I would not consider root canal treatment at this stage, unless you start experiencing more severe symptoms.\nAlso make sure to check the occlusion on the tooth, after replacing the filling. VallartaLad: Thanks hugely!  I guess this replacement filling would also be called an onlay filling then? (or inlay?).\n\nYou mentioned amalgam.  But is there any reason NOT to request composite material?  I know it doesn't have the longevity of amalgam. I'm in my mid 60s if that helps answer this.  Should I perhaps be concerned that my dentist may have a tougher time keeping the area dry so it can bond, and layering the composite in an ideal way? Dr M: Moisture contamination is one of the main risk factors, which influences the bonding of the resin composite to the underlying enamel and dentine. Any poor areas of bonding might lead to micro leakage and sensitivity. With any composite material, it is critical to keep the area dry, with a rubberdam and suction.\nAmalgam on the other hand is a lot less moisture sensitive. VallartaLad: Got it!  Thanks!\n\nIf I do go for a crown after chatting with the dentist, I think I'd choose a full cast gold alloy (highly noble). \n\nSince this needs less tooth reduction than other crown types, this should reduce the chances that I'd trigger a need for a root canal.  Plus I suspect the crown's core integrity will stand up well, if I do ultimately need a root canal and the endodontist drills a hole thru the crown.  And I don't mind the esthetics that far back in my mouth.\n\nSo my last question:  Are most dentists willing to provide a pretreatment estimate for the cost of a gold crown up front?  Or does the variable price of gold and the inability to predict how much gold is needed until the impressions are taken, just make this simply impossible to estimate?\n\nMight PFM with metal (i.e. gold) occlusal be a good 2nd choice?\n\nThanks!"

Dr M: Good day\nI have a very close relationship with my lab technician. In difficult cases like this, there are a lot of things to consider. If the tooth was root canal treated, non-vital bleaching could have been considered in order to whiten the tooth prior to the crown placement. If it was only black stains, this could have been polished away. In more severe cases, I send my patient to the lab in order to choose the shade. Sometimes they have to place a block out layer over the stains, whereafter they put the porcelain.\nThis should have been part of the initial treatment planning, when taking on a case like this."

    "dialogue": "Rue: My new dentist has recommended extraction of teeth 8 teeth leaving 2nd molars & pre-molars both sides top & bottom and all front teeth. (In prep 4 braces decades ago, 4 molars were pulled.) He is recommending partials. While I know it would be more expensive, would combination bridge, partial denture be better? Would you do bridge on bottom & partial on top? Remaining molars would be restored. Could that be done before extractions, or does it make sense to work on one section at a time. Really dreading extractions. New dentist experienced & seems competent, but he's NEW to me! Thanks honestdoc: You will always get different opinions.  Some important considerations are which procedures are more traumatic (more drilling, more surgery, etc.), more costly vs benefit (value), and more functional vs esthetic.  I always favor less traumatic.  Partial dentures will be less traumatic than bridges.  With bridges, the abutment teeth needs prepping (drilling).  After drilling, those teeth can get more sensitive and painful.  When the bridges get cemented and you don't clean them as recommended, you can get cavities under them and worst case lose the abutment teeth.   Partials do not require a lot of drilling but they are not as functional and comfortable as bridges (minus any sensitivity) due to their removable (not cemented) nature.  Many people do get accustomed to them so they are happy.  \n\nI'm very big on prevention.  I get disappointed with my colleagues when their patients continue to have deteriorating teeth with no discussions on home care and prevention.  Bottom line, natural teeth will always trump any restoration. Rue: Thank you for your response. I hadn't factored the Trauma associated with bridges and that makes the decision somewhat easier. Age & aging crowns bring me here. I have always been meticulous about brushing & flossing."

    "dialogue": "Whatteeth: When there is a need for major, basically full mouth restoration, for implants, there are many service provider options.\n\nIt's hard to pick. There are international providers; 'corporate' providers such as ClearChoise or 'dental implant centers; regional US providers, and local providers.\n\nThere are also different types of dentists who might offer services, e.g., prosthodontists.\n\nMy priorities would be one, quality, and two value. If only quality mattered, I'd probably go to a local specialist, but the price there seems it can approach $100,000, and that's quite a lot. 'Corporate' providers I haven't priced but ballpark sound like maybe $50,000. International less.\n\nIt's a pretty important selection, and the choices have me not getting it performed. honestdoc: I would avoid chains/corporate settings (I worked at a few).  They are more concerned with production than quality.  If specialists fees are too high, try training facilities where they train prosthodontists to restore and surgeons to place implants. Whatteeth: Thanks for the suggestion. This would be 'place', not 'restore', so does that rule our prosthodontists? Is there a name for the specialist other than 'surgeons'?\n\nI'll have to look for training. Do you think the quality will still be there? The only one I've seen in the area was the state university UCSF, and they only have the faculty offer the service, and they don't offer bone grafts, that seem like a good idea. honestdoc: Usually you will go to the restoring dentist (general dentist, faculty, prosthodontist) for full consult and evaluation.  That restoring dentist coordinates with the surgeon (periodontist or oral surgeon) to place implants, bone graft, etc.  At a school/training facility, everything will be overseen by an experienced provider so the quality should not be a concern. Whatteeth: Thanks. I wouldn't mind going to a prosthodontist for advice where to get the service, but think it'd be awkward because they'd want to do it themself. I even had that with a general dentist who wanted to - her yelp reviews said 'she wants to do a lot more than she can'."

Recently, #17 exhibits quick sharp burst of pain chewing hard foods like chips, but only if the food hits the tooth dead center, otherwise passive pressure while chewing does not elicit any reaction.  I do not experience ongoing soreness or pain, and my tooth is not affected by changes in temperature.  During my filling the dentist applied two shots of novacaine as well as a carbocaine injection to ensure complete numbness.

Mdel205: I am not in possession of my most recent x-rays, however at the time my dentist did not see anything of concern either in the image or examination.\nThe sensation I feel is very specific when crunchy food hits my molar dead center, and my tooth won't even react if I poke that same area with a tooth pick.  It still does not react to temperature changes either.  I was thinking of giving it some time and see if the feeling goes away in case it is related to nerves, and if not call my dentist.

As soon as the temp crowns are replaced by the permanent crowns. these triangles tend to get smaller and disappear, since the gum tissue heals and adapts.\nIf you had bone loss around your front teeth however, prior to the crown preps, these triangles might remain, since the interdental papillae ( gum in between teeth ) is influenced by the underlying bone."

Two weeks ago, my dentist removed all the decay without administering any anesthetics; he could tell just by looking at the tooth that it was necrotic and I felt no pain during the procedure. In that process of decay...\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\twww.dentistry-forums.com\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nLast year, the cavity was taken out and even though the tooth was necrotic, we didn't do an RCT. Mainly due to Covid concerns and my age, we decided to hold off on that and take bi-annual X-rays to monitor the situation. Now that we're able to go back to the dentist, a recent visit showed that there is a radiolucency at the apex and the infection is draining thru the side of the tooth, there is small abscess on the buccal side of the gum, and there is also a cavity adjacent and under the big amalgam restoration that's about 4mm under the gumline. The dentist said that because this new decay is on the root of the tooth and under the gumline, it is difficult to restore and therefore suggested extraction.\nI have attached the most recent periapical X-ray but it might be difficult to see the new decay. Is this 4mm subgingival restoration impossible to do? Does it definitely require a crown lengthening procedure or is there a way to do it without out that? This is my last functional tooth on the left side and I'm really hoping to save it. Thanks in advance. MattKW: 4mm subging might be possible in amalg only. Of course you also need to do the RCT to resolve the abscess. There's no need to do crown lengthening, and it might make the situation worse because you risk exposing the furcation of the roots. The only other option is to extract, and place an implant. Mo24078: Thanks so much for your reply. I have a few follow-up questions that I would very much appreciate your opinion,\n\n- For a subgingival amalgam restoration, do I have to look for a specialist? The dentist we saw said she wouldn't be able to do such a restoration.\n- Is a subgingival restoration doomed to fail quickly because the margin is under the gumline and since it's harder to clean, bacteria will eventually get in?\n- Is a crown an option her at all? MattKW: A specialist is not required. Maybe your dentist is not comfortable with subging amalgs? They can be fiddly to get enough retention (\"grip\").\nYes, more likely because of the chance of decay starting again, and because the gum doesn't react well to foreign substances.\nA crown would still be subgingival (unless you gum lengthen), and difficult to do.\nI suggest the subging amalg because it is the most cost-effective solution for this bad situation. Going to the expense of crown lengthening (and crowning) may only offer a slightly better chance of success for a lot more $$$."

One problem here is that I suffer from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and one feature of this is that I'm extremely sensitive to anything 'feeling wrong' in my mouth: as soon as I have any restoration done, I feel around it with my tongue, and if it doesn't feel exactly the same as before I'd had the work done, I feel distress.\n\nMy present dentist is very good, but he told me that to do the crown, he would only be making an impression of the tooth AFTER it had been ground down, plus an impression of the opposing (ie: lower) teeth. I asked him how a lab could possibly deliver a crown that was exactly the shape of my tooth if it did not have an impression of it, but all he said was \"they're very experienced people\".\n\nI know that the impression of the opposing teeth would be enough to make a crown that would occlude satisfactorily, but I need more than this: I need a crown where the shape of the whole tooth, not just the occlusal surface, is the same as the original tooth, because otherwise my tongue will feel the difference.\n\nI've had several CEREC crowns done, and they're fine, but with CEREC, an impression is made (via a camera) of both the unprepared tooth and the prepared tooth. The problem is, to get CEREC, I would have to go to another dentist in a distant town - a dentist who'd be an unknown quantity, whereas I know my own dentist is first rate.\n\nSo I suppose my question is: can I rely on a lab-made crown being natural enough to  satisfy my OCD? Thanks. honestdoc: No, handmade lab crowns will never be exactly like your original contours.  A possibility is your dentist will need to provide an impression of the tooth before it gets prepped.  The technician can then survey the contours to match as close as possible (analog way).  If you had CEREC (digital) crowns and your fine with them, then that may be the option.  I find CEREC crown margins not as well-sealed in the margins as the handmade ones."

The pain is very acute, sharp and shooting type pain, but short lived, with no dull ache or throbbing. There is no discomfort with cold, hot or sweet things. It has been like this for the last 6 years. \n\nThe filling has been redone by 3 different dentists approximately 4 times, there is no obvious fracture line in the tooth , and this has been checked with a microscope once the filling is removed. The filling is also not high, and has been adjusted out of the occlusion. \n\nThe composite filling was replaced with a temporary zinc oxide eugenol filling and the pain went completely. After 4 months, a permanent composite was again placed, and the pain symptoms returned. The tooth is not tender to percussion and responds perfectly normally to cold test. There is no pocketing around it. \n\nAside from a possible fractured tooth (which seems unlikely given the very small size of the filling), I cannot think what may be causing the pain.\n\nAny thoughts on possible reasons for the pain? \n\nI have attached a copy of a recent bitewing I took. \n\nThank you,\n\nKingsley honestdoc: Unfortunately all composite materials shrink about 1 to 1.5% during light curing.  This can cause micro stresses between the bonding and tooth structure.  Have your dentist use Fuji Equia final glass ionomer restorative material or better yet (more expensive to the dentist) Activa bioactive restorative material from Pulpdent. MattKW: Sometimes the smaller composites can be more troublesome than incrementally filled larger composites. The fact that you got relief using a temp ZnO is a good sign. Also consider a amalgam with a Dycal or GIC lining. Butterfly5: Dear Kingsley\n\nWere you able to solve your problem? If so, how?\n\nThank you very much"

Dr M: Good day,\n\nAlthough rare, certain patients has shown to be allergic to the crown cement that has been used. Sometimes even the temporary cement underneath temporary crowns. Especially if they contain Eugenol.\nI would suggest a new dentist if your regular dentists doesn't have alternative materials and won't at least try and accommodate you. There are a lot of modern crown cements to use. To determine the exact type of allergy, specific allergen testing should be done.\nThat being said, it is is possible that the gum was also just irritated by irregular margins on the temporary crown and then when this was replaced with the smooth margins of the permanent crown, the irritant was removed and everything returned to normal.\nIf you have no symptoms anymore, I would mention this reaction the next time any crown work is done. joss: Well, there wasn't a problem with the permanent crown, once it replaced the temporary, NO irritation, so I believe it is the material used in the temporary.\nNow, the material my dentist used to fill the hole he drilled in my permanent crown is bothering my mouth just like that \"temp\" crown.\nThere has to be a correlation between those two materials.

Kate 44: I would get the data safety sheet for the materials the dentist used  and have an allergist test me for those chemicals in a scratch test\nMaybe you have an allergy to one particular ingredient.

I had to sign a Crown release of liability form that said the crown could end up being swallowed and other things.  Never have I encountered this before\n2.  Shot hurt more than any shot in 40 years.\n3.  Could not get the crown off, so he had to break it.  Tiny pieces went into the area.  I was laying almost horizontal and afraid some would go down my throat like a little water did.\n4.  He filled the tooth nub below the gum just a little and said the cap would have to go lower and might irritate the gum.  If so, the gum might have to be lowered.\n5.  They got glue residue around the area where they worked.\n6.  The temporary molar is so rough on the sides it feels like a barnacle.\n7.  I was told to go into the restroom and wipe off my lips as they got cement on my lips\n8.  His hand seemed slightly shaky when he was working on me.\n\nAre all these things pretty standard or would they be reason to loose confidence in this new dentist? Dr M: Good day\n\nA temporary crown or in rare cases, the permanent crown, can come loose due to various factors and if this happens when you are sleeping, you might swallow it. This is just part of his informed consent process.\nNot all injections feel the same. They are sometimes operator and technique sensitive.\nOld crowns sometimes need to be drilled through and broken in order to remove them. Not all crowns can be removed intact. The dentist or assistant would have used high volume suction to suck up all the broken pieces.\nIf there was decay that had to be filled, the crown can't have margins that rest on filling material. It has to rest on solid tooth structure and has to allow for adequate ferrule effect. This means that sometimes the crown margin has to go below the gum line and in certain case crown lengthening has to be done, where the ' gum line ' is re-positioned.\nTemporary fillings or crowns can sometimes be rough. If it hurts you, go back to the dentist for more polishing. This is not how the permanent crown is going to feel like.\nTemporary cement can sometimes be messy, as well as the impression taking process. It is a good thing that he allowed you to clean your face where his hands might have touched, before you left the practice.\n\nI would not lose confidence in this new dentist as yet."

It's a weird feeling - like I have been through a lot with this front tooth and now they are taking it out. \n\nThe problem started when I was a child - half the tooth was knocked out and so half of the tooth was fake. Over the years, the foundation of that tooth has weakened, there was decay that I didn't even know about and now the tooth is so loose that it has shifted and I have a front teeth gap that wasn't there before. \n\nI won't be able to afford an implant for quite some time, so this flipper will be permanent for a while. My dentist told me that I need to let it heal for a month, before doing the mold and getting the flipper. So I will look like a hillbilly for a while.\n\nI wanted to ask a dentist here if there are different front tooth flipper options that I should bring up with my dentist. Do they all have the metal wires that hook on to your teeth or do some pop right into the roof of your mouth?\n\nOne issue is that I already have a speech impediment, so I am worried the flipper will make it worse. I was told that they can do a metal plate that is thinner than the plastic plate, but I am not sure if that will make any difference when it comes to talking. I know it is something that I will probably have to get used to, but it would be good to get the best option in this regard. \n\nI guess I am just worried about my smile looking the same - once the tooth that I have had for decades is gone. I mean do they tweak the flipper repeatedly until it looks like how I want it to look like my original tooth is still there or is it more they just take the mold, make the flipper and here you go as long as it fits right. How about matching the color of the rest of your teeth?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any dentist feedback on a front tooth flipper and any responses from people who actually have a front tooth flipper. \n\nThank you,\n\nHM MattKW: Flippers are a very simple plastic denture. Sometimes they can have wires which grip onto the back teeth, but sometimes there is not enough room to do this for the 1st flipper unless adjustments are made to the back teeth. Metal dentures would make it easier for you to adjust your speech, but often require more adjustment of the back teeth, and this may be more harm than good - talk to your dentist. Many people have dentures and you wouldn't know it. Your tongue will adjust to the extra thickness, but will probably take about 2 weeks. Just talk slowly and as clearly as poss so your brain relearns the positioning."

In the mean time, it was suggested that I have braces to straighten out the teeth on the mandibular arch as they attempted to elevate and try and fill the gap the missing teeth left behind. Following that, it was suggested that I have a maryland bridge of which the wings would be supported by the two canines on either side. I've had this setup for almost 20 years. Although, it has come loose a handful of times, it is always on the back of my mind and a cause for concern as it is not very secure when compared to other solutions.\n\nIn recent years, I've revisited the thought of having implants, so I have consulted with a variety of prosthodontists.

I have found that upper partial dentures are more tolerable, although in the end it is still something removable.\nIt is important to make sure the teeth supporting the partial denture are also sound.\nYou can always use this as a temporary option until you can afford something more permanent. MattKW: Only replacing the last 2 molars by making a denture is likely to be uncomfortable. I doubt you will find a denture to be worth the trouble and cost."

There is like 30% bone-loss already on the second, but it seems to be staying there. Anyway, the reason this keep happening is due to food particles getting trapped behind the crown. I was told it's more prone to this due to how deep the implant is placed.\n\nWhat I am trying to figure out is this. I want to get new (gold) crowns for the implants. Is there a particular way that the crown itself can be shaped beyond the gum line where food particles can no longer become trapped up there causing abscesses? honestdoc: The answer to the question on the person who fabricates crowns for implants and teeth in general is a dental ceramist.  Usually only the dentist communicates with that technician.  The ceramist can modify most details but it needs to be communicated beforehand."

They use Doc's Best Copper Cement and I might have treatment with that cement.\n\nAnd here is my question: Is Doc's Best Copper Cement still considered as effective, reliable or suitable under some conditions? It seems it's unpopular and out of date nowadays.\n\nI have a fear of losing my nerve and I believe the cement's best selling point is to decrease the risk of losing nerve. Would it be better cement or something? MattKW: It's a zinc phosphate cement that is normally used to glue on crowns (a lute), and was sometimes used as a base in the past. The only \"selling point\" is that it is antibacterial, which is probably true; however, its initial setting pH is quite acidic at ~3.5 and is much more likely to irritate a nerve than settle it. The antibacterial property is insignificant.\nIf you were trying to temporarily settle a nerve, you would use zinc oxide/eugenol cement. \nI still keep some zinc phosphate cement for very specific situations like gluing a long term temporary crown, but that's about all. sunny_sammy: So, Doc's Best isn't the best...

I have this procedure done regularly but it was my first visit in that particular clinic. After the scaling, my teeth were extremely sensitive (hot/cold drinks, brushing teeth, eating). I've also noticed that on multiple teeth, the enamel is, sort of, chipped off. There are spots on my teeth that are grey and it's extremely painful when touching them for example with my nails. I'm also very confident that these grey spots (like missing enamel) were not present before the scaling.\n\nHow could this happen? Is it possible that the hygienist did something wrong? I'll soon be going to a dentist to check this but I thought that I'd ask you in the meantime because I've been having sleepless nights because of this. I'd enormously appreciate any input. Thank you! Dr M: Good day\nDo you perhaps have photos of these grey areas or spots?\nIf you had certain areas that were demineralized, it is possible that these areas could cavitate, especially with pressure from the ultrasonic scaler. They will then require fillings. marq111: Hello, I enormously appreciate your response. Here is a picture that shows three of the affected teeth - \n\n\n\n. Dr M: Good day\n\nIt looks like you have abrasion lesions on these teeth. It might only be a coincidence that it became sensitive after the cleaning was done. These lesions tend to develop due to excessive brushing with a hard toothbrush. Try switching to a toothbrush with soft bristles. These areas can also be filled with a filling material, if the lesions are deep enough, to help combat the sensitivity"

    "title": "Zirconium crowns - are they the best solution for my problem?",
    "dialogue": "markowich: Hi, I am turning to this forum for piece of advice about my current dental situation.\n\nI am 33 years old. I have had not very strong enamel since I can remember, and recently I have been experiencing some sensitivity in my upper central incisors. Couple of months ago one of my fillings fell off from one of them and my dentists replaced it, but since then they have become even more sensitive. I had an appointment couple of days ago and my dentists explained that it’s probably due to the fact, that both incisors are very thin and worn out, meaning the nerve is starting to get exposed more and more (attached photos). I strongly suspect this abrasion is the consequence of my particular “bite type”, because my bottom incisors always slide against my lingual side of upper incisors. Otherwise I do not have problems with griding my teeth in my sleep or anything like that.\n\nCurrently this is not an urgent matter, but I am starting to feel some discomfort due to sensitivity. My dentist recommended zirconium crowns would be a best solution and wants to implement them as soon as possible. I believe he mentioned being made with computer assisted modelling and they also measure the colour shade beforehand, so they match very good with other teeth. Considering it is an important health issue for me, the price tag is not that high (250 eur per piece, because the rest is covered by health insurance).\n\nI unfortunately lost some confidence in my dentist, since he made some bad decisions in past years regarding my other dental issues – that is the reason I would like to get a second opinion from good people of this forum. Is there even an alternative on the long run or is this the only reasonable way to proceed?\n\nI really appreciate all the answers,\n\n Best regards honestdoc: Do you have images of your lower front teeth?  The way you're biting can strongly impact the success of any restorations.  There are some considerations because there is no right or wrong answers.  The questions are, how esthetic do you want, how strong the crowns need to be (E-max vs Zirconia), how much space do you have when your teeth come together.  When any dentist prep your teeth for a crown, your teeth may feel more sensitive especially with cold substances.  I do see a lot of incisal wear and I believe you may need a custom bite guard. markowich: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDo you have images of your lower front teeth?

I will certainly give it a shot since it could help against further wearing down of my teeth. I must say that I don’t have a tendency to grind my teeth because of stress, also my partner says I do not do that at night. But I believe I am very susceptible to acid erosion. Couple of months ago I was drinking some wine at a wedding and my teeth hurt for almost two weeks after the event when I was brushing them (and I use Curaprox ultra soft).\n\nI am adding pictures of my bottom teeth and bite.\n\nWhat do you think about composite bonding and regular use of fluoride varnish like Colgate Duraphat? After thinking a bit I think I would like to try out some alternatives before going for the crowns. honestdoc: Sorry for the late reply.  I was out of town tending to my sick father.  Composites are a great option.  They are less traumatic (less drilling than crowns).  However, they are not as strong and they can wear and stain quickly.  In the US, the clear bite guard materials are not available due to Covid Pandemic.  I'm not sure about Europe.  Once available, have your teeth restored and custom fabricate one to minimize further wear/damage. markowich: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSorry for the late reply.

Hope everything is ok.\n\nI appreciate your input. I am leaning towards option with composite, at least for now. I can still go for crowns later I believe. I found this case study where they used this approach instead of crowns (https://www.dentistrytoday.com/rest...aesthetic-bonding-augmentation-not-amputation).\n\nThank you again for your insight,\nBest regards, honestdoc: Wise choice.  Composites are usually the first choice due to their conservative nature.  You can always get crowns later.  Also consider available bite guards to minimize wear. MattKW: Rebuild is definitely the way to go in this case. Crowns would be quite risky and may lead to nerve death. In the link you provide, they have placed palatal veneers after drilling back some tooth structure. I wouldn't advise this removal of precious tooth structure. \nInstead, composite build-ups will require no damage to your teeth at all. I used to do this with softened composite fillings (warm them up), but some new flowables (e.g. G-aenial Flow) have made this much simpler. The teeth are waxed up on a model, and a plastic template made into which the composite is injected. Much, much better than doing by freehand. \nIf you build up your front teeth in this way, then your back teeth won't touch initially, but will come together after a few months (the Dahl Principle or Dahl Concept)."

    "title": "Extensive Dental Work Questions...",
    "dialogue": "uggaugga: I have a 2 year old and recently got a second opinion for her - first dentist said all teeth needed crowns, but the second opinion we paid for out of pocket mentioned 14 crowns. I think 14 crowns is better than 20, but I'm still not excited about this...it's a lot of dental work and I'm still having a rough time with it. I still don't have pictures as she won't let me look and they so far won't do x-rays unless they're under sedation. Of course, they will know more after x-rays. I am taking her to another dentist (that the second opinion dentist referred me to) this week to hopefully get a treatment plan and everything because I was told they take our insurance, but I don't feel too much at ease because I was at that dentist when I was a kid. I mean, that was so many years ago (like 17 years ago), but I remember they didn't numb me enough to fill cavities and I cried, but they didn't stop working nor ask if I still had any pain and never re-numbed anything. All the numbing was done before all 5 cavities, not one at a time before each cavity drilled. By the time they got around to the last few cavities, it's like the numbing wore off. Another time, I went in with a wisdom tooth infection as that is where my mom scheduled me and he poked the infection with one of his sharp tools and it freaked him out when I jumped and he said, \"Yes, that looks painful.\" My mouth was throbbing again. I'm kind of scared to take my own child there, but as for local places that take our insurance, it's what we have here. I tried to get her in to see the dentist that was recommended by the second opinion as they said they heard a lot of good things about him.\n\nI'm terrified about sedation being used on my child, scared that the worst will happen. I'm worried about her being hungry and thirsty and being dehydrated for so long beforehand. They have the same anesthesiologist as the second opinion I went to and they had a lot of good things to say about him. I'm concerned about leakage from the root canals and infection that may be left in those teeth making her sick down the road. I'm concerned about chemicals used in the process that could be absorbed by her little body. After all, it'll be about 12 years before they are all out of her mouth. I am thankful they aren't permanent teeth, but it's still so extensive I wonder how much pain she'll be in following the procedure. Of course I'll have infant Tylenol on hand, but still. The benefit is that she'll hopefully have molars to use to chew until they do fall out. Do baby teeth normally fall out when they are supposed to when there are root canals on their teeth or do they have trouble sometimes? Her worst teeth are her molars...I'm not sure if a dentist would only do the teeth that are causing pain since she's under anesthesia and they will probably do every little bit they can, but I am still concerned about the extensiveness of this. I feel so helpless right now... Dr M: Good day,\n\nI remember your case and I understand your fears. A lot of parents are scared, especially when it comes to sedation of their children. Usually we wait up until 2 years of age, because then the \" potential risks \" are a lot less. \nIt is common to keep the kids from eating and drinking before anaesthesia, so she shouldn't have any risk of dehydration. She might only be a bit irritated, but in the long run, it is worth the trouble going through this process.\nIn terms of the planned crowns and pulpectomies; This treatment is done to try and keep the baby teeth in the mouth for as long as possible. Besides the fact that they assist with eating and speech development, they also keep space for the permanent teeth. If baby teeth are lost too early, there is a higher risk that orthodontic treatment might be required at a later stage.\nThat being said, there is still a chance that the pulpectomies might fail after a few years, but every year won means a lot in the development of a child uggaugga: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tGood day,\n\nI remember your case and I understand your fears.

Granted, some will probably be in her mouth for only 2 or 3 more years, but the molars of course will be there for much longer. I keep telling myself I need her to not be hurting on her bottom molars anymore and need them to continue to chew food and let the adult teeth come through the best way possible. It feels like the options are narrow at this point and it's so sad. Although, it still is a small victory that a second opinion vouched for less crowns than the first dentist we took her to. We'll see how the next appointment goes and when they can schedule her in.\n\nI'm glad to hear that the risks at 2 years of age are a lot less since she's almost 3. I think just as a parent I'll be worrying up until the point she wakes up from the surgery or at least is at home and the anesthesia and everything has completely worn off and she's more comfortable with the new crowns. I'll try hard not to worry about it as much.\n\nThank you again for your input. uggaugga: Got back from the dentist today. Now all we need to do is wait for the call to schedule the appointment after insurance approves it. It's not going to be until January/February that they can get her in. So like 2-4 months...This is so difficult because her back molar does bother her. Not sure what else can be done for her except give her Tylenol for the pain when she has it. \n\nThey only offer IV sedation there, but I have heard that this is safer than general anesthesia? Is it? Are there any drawbacks to it? \n\nThe dentist mentioned a risk of breakage from the front baby teeth. He mentioned that if they end up doing pulpectomies on those, they are usually so thin that there isn't much left and often times they start breaking after the crowns are put in place leading to another IV sedation appointment to pull the teeth so they may just recommend pulling them instead of even bothering with the crowns. Space maintainers were not mentioned, nor am I sure they even do those for front teeth, but if it's all the top front teeth I am worried about the permanent teeth coming in causing issues. I'm not liking what I'm hearing on that, but I am glad that he was honest about it. I'm thinking I may have them leave the front teeth alone and then if it absolutely bothers her that we will definitely make sure to bring her back and get it pulled. My oldest that has been seeing a different dentist mentioned they did a \"wait and see\" approach and her's are worse than my 2 year old's and they have been for a while, but the dentist would always mention, \"We will keep an eye on them and do what we can because it won't be too long before they fall out. If they cause pain and problems, then we will address it.\" My 5 year olds front teeth have generally been pretty worn down, but she has already lost 3 baby teeth and two more are wiggly so the decayed ones are almost all gone and the permanents have been looking good so far and coming in well.  I don't know, it's a huge decision to make and I'll see what my husband thinks, too."

Can I have good results if the abutment teeth 27 and 31 are used to make a 5 unit bridge?\n\n2. What would be the best way to bridge?\n\nThank you Dr M: Good day\n\nDo you have any x-rays? This would be a great help in order to give an honest opinion fallonboy: Hello\n\nNo xray at this time but I do have a disc CBCT scan. I do not know how to view the CBCT very well. I may be able to get xrays on 8/31/2020.\n\nOriginally there was a permanent bridge from 28 thru 31. I had a tooth ache at #28 so a root canal was done. Later I went in for a bridge replacement and it was discovered that #28 had decayed down to the gum and could not be built up. So, #28 is scheduled for extraction. I am told #31 is in good shape.\n\nImplants at #28 and #30 and bridge would cost $10,000.00. Looking for other workable solutions.\n\nThank you for your help. honestdoc: I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I foresee a lot of potential problems and wasted money.  I see severe teeth deterioration.  What is causing all the deterioration?  Do you have diabetes, heart condition(s), dry mouth from numerous medications, other severe health problems?  Do you use recreational drugs like meth?  If you don't manage and resolve the source(s) of deterioration, any dental work will fail including implants such as that root canal tooth #28.\n\nI'm not a big fan of bridges especially long-span bridge like in your case.  It places too much stress on the abutment teeth.  Some dentist may drill multiple abutment teeth but that means more teeth to fail.  You may consider treatment (temporary) partial denture and stabilize your teeth for further restorative options.  If your teeth further deteriorates, you may have to consider full dentures.  If you want implants, make sure you are healthy and don't smoke.  Otherwise implants will fail. fallonboy: Hello\n\nThank you for your reply.\n\nThe cell phone photo of the CBCT scan does look bad. I am sorry I sent it.\n\nNo, I have no tooth/gum related conditions.\n\nHere is a cell phone photo I took a month ago before the bridge was cut off. You can see the root canal at #28. That tooth is being extracted next month. My periodontist and my general dentist want to do bone graft and later after healing implants at #28 and #30. This will cost $10k. My bride says why not go for the less expensive partial removable bridge.\n\nA bridge using available abutment teeth does seem like a good idea….to me. But I am no dentist.\n\nThanks again honestdoc: Removable partial is definitely less expensive and less drilling (less traumatic).  The only downside is it may be less comfortable and more hassles taking it in and out.  If you can get used to it, then it would be a better choice than the long span fixed (cemented) bridge."

    "dialogue": "Noodle: I asked my dentist if anything could be done with the tooth that is circled in the picture, and he said no. But can it be filled? honestdoc: It depends on your biting and lateral excursions clearance.  The canine teeth have the longest roots designed to \"guide\" all your teeth during routine function so the other teeth doesn't \"crash\" to each other and break apart.  Over time, the canines can wear down and lose its guidance potential causing possible damage to other teeth.  The dentist can put some bonding on that defect.  However, it can change the bite causing potential issues.  The bonding material will never be as strong as opposing enamel and as a result, the filling may not last very long.  I'm noticing a lot of wear and damage on your teeth and restorations.  You may need to consider an over the counter vs custom bite guard. Noodle: Many thanks for your comprehensive reply. After 70 years my teeth are showing signs of wear, but I will investigate bite-guards (which I had not heard of before).\n\nI'll also consult my dentist again, armed with the information in your reply."

Dr M: Good day\n\nA bridge is usually used to replace 1 or more missing teeth and is attached to abutment teeth with \"fake \" teeth hanging in the middle. Depending on the condition of the abutment teeth, you can section or cut the bridge in order to possibly save one or both of the abutment teeth with their crowns and then replace the pontics, or missing teeth, with an implant/s. If both the abutment teeth are in poor condition, they can also be extracted,after the bridge was sectioned, and then replaced with either immediate implants for an implant bridge, or individual implants, depending on the space availability and condition of the bone, as well as the proximity to other anatomical important structures.\n\nHope this helps"

Dr M: Good day,\n\nI would be very careful with some of the temporary cements, since they can sometimes damage the underlying tooth structure when trying to remove it, during the cementation of the permanent crown.\nThe whole idea of a temporary crown is to give you some function on that tooth until the permanent crown is placed. More importantly-it is to protect the prepared tooth structure until the permanent crown can be placed. If the margins of the prepared tooth become damaged accidentally, it can influence the seal of the permanent crown, which might end up in failure of the treatment.\nIt would be my suggestion to go back to your dentist, to get it placed back by a professional. This is a lot safer and I know that I don't charge my patients to replace a temporary crown if it becomes loose."

    "dialogue": "DT1: Dear Doctors:\n\nI recently snapped off a crown at/near the gum line while chomping on a hard pretzel in a rush. Its unfortunate because I have had it for 14 years. My guess is some decay got in where the crown meets the tooth structure and it would have happened anyway. Have not seen any dentist yet due to COVID and logistics and it seems this doesn’t qualify as an emergency. It doesn’t seem to be visible unless I smile really wide but I’m still very worried for obvious reasons! No x-rays to share but do have some pics and can provide more if you need. I know it may be guesswork without actually looking in person and some x-rays but any feedback based on your experience would be helpful. I am very leery about implants as the thought of bolting a screw into my mouth is not something I envision. My hope is that the crown can be replaced.\n\nOther data points: I don’t recall the exact procedure done 14 years ago but part of this tooth was chipped while chewing some gum, perhaps due to excessive force. I recall having to attend a wedding that same week, so I told my then dentist I need a fast fix. I’m not sure if it underwent a root canal but it must have. When I look inside the detached crown, I could see two metallic looking dots and I assume they are posts? Subsequent to this event I was very careful with the tooth and had cleanings 2x per year. Unfortunately, in the last year or so, I missed my cleanings and got lazy about hygiene. Hindsight is 20/20 I know. Feeling worried. Thanks in advance. honestdoc: Most likely the crown will not retain in what's left.  I don't see swelling or infection for now.  I suggest you still get seen.  You don't have to get an implant.  Implants are only elective.  If you are fine with the gap there, great.  The dentist will assess the conditions and most likely need to remove the rest of the tooth as it is a source for infection.

It could also cement to the little remaining of #20, now just below gum line.  If it lasts just 3 months, still better than an implant.  \n\nMy question is how long could this hold?\n\nwhy this should work\n#20 is a low stress tooth ... BEST tooth position for lateral support from surrounding teeth.\nThe old crown once it had fallen out, it stayed in place even without cement.\nThis was fine,  until the post broke.\n\nTrue, the post provide stability I won't have with my cement idea, \nbut the post was only pushing into the mush of the decay that had caused it to fall out in the first place!\nIf that is all it takes to keep from tipping over, then copious dental cement could as well?\nPerhaps a very small post could be put in remains of #20. Or fill 20 with epoxy to place post. \n\nI haven't gotten a dentist to take a breath and REALLY considers this.  \nThere is no risk to trying it.  If I find one who will do it, and I'll fly to them.\nIf it works, will be interesting dental news.\n\nThe new crown could have a rounded bottom  molded to exact shape of remains of #20. \nThis alone provides a large contact surface for cement.\nNew crown is stabilized by adjacent #19 and 21 and cemented to them.\nRepair if it falls out is easy - just re-cement.  \nFour repairs each year is $400 - better than invasive $4000 implant that also doesn't last forever.\n (A small strip might be glued across the back of all three teeth if really necessary, like a maryland bridge but not as complex or damaging supporting teeth as with maryland bridge)\n\nI've delayed a month since the post broke and crown no longer stays. \nThe gum is starting to grow over the remaining tooth.\n\"Nuking\" my jaw with an implant I deeply feel isn't the answer. \nThe laws of physics tell me cementing should work.  \nBut I don't know teeth, and I need knowledgeable comments.  \nPlease be careful to not sound like dogma ... like a cancer doctor saying chemo is only option.  \n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH JUST FOR LISTENING!  I realize I prefer a maryland bridge over an implant just by writing this.  But I still think my cement idea will work and is best at least to try.  The old crown might even be reusable for it. \n\nKNOWLEDGEABLE COMMENTS ARE NEEDED! \n\nx-ray attached (didn't aim very well but show status at gum line etc) Dr M: Good day,\n\nFirstly I can't say if the relevant tooth is \" low stress \" due to not enough information, regarding the rest of your mouth? Are there any opposing teeth, and what is the occlusion like?  if this is the dominant chewing side, the tooth can actually undergo additional forces that might increase the stress load.\nIf a resin cement is used to just stick the crown to the remaining tooth structure and adjacent teeth, it does not guarantee a proper seal of the root canal treated tooth even if shaped properly, due to the crown undergoing forces in all dimensions during passive and active occlusion. This might lead to leakage that could result in infection of the remaining root canal treated structure leading to abscess formation.\nThere is also no guarantee that once the crown comes loose, the remaining cement might not break off further tooth structure or cause a crack, leading to eventual leakage and infection.\nIf the remaining tooth structure is above bone level and there is sufficient ferrule, then a new crown and post might be an option, but from the radio-graph it seems unlikely. Otherwise a Maryland bridge might be an option.\nI gather from your post that you are not pro-implant and I am not sure on what your opinion is based. Implantology has progressed a lot in the last few years.\n\" Nuking\" your jaw with an implant is not really the right terminology to use here, not trying to sound offensive.\nA well planned out and placed implant can last you the rest of your life.\nThere are always various factors, patient and operator factors, surgical factors and others that could influence the success, true, but this is true for most interventions."

The crown is about 10 years old.\n\nthanks honestdoc: Usually for front crowns, the dentist used bonded resin cements (about 10 yrs ago).  These are the strongest class of cements.  Your crown should hold up until your next visit.  Tell your dentist that the crown broke numerous times and special attention may be needed.  You and the dentist may consider zirconia for higher strength vs Emax for better esthetics.

The canine provides for facial profiles and orthodontically moving the canine can be difficult.  Crowning can introduce a lot of pitfalls especially if your bite is not stable. robbie: Hi honest doc   Thanks for taking the time to reply I have enclosed some pics & as you can see my teeth aren’t great. The dentist I spoke to in turkey is highly recommended & she reckoned she could incorporate the tooth that’s missing. I also spoke to her about doing a full makeover for upper & lower jaw ie 26 crowns she mentioned. My bite isn’t great at the minute as accasionally I bite my tongue .... would having work done improve this ? And do you think the work mentioned is possible. Thanks rob honestdoc: Could you provide an image with your natural bite?  I'm not sure how your dentist will add a tooth that is missing.  The canine had drifted into the missing space.  Your case will be very challenging to correct the midline and accommodate a potentially destructive biting patterns.  If you will be investing in your treatment, hopefully your dentist will provide a \"mock up\" of you teeth for you to review.  There will be a lot of work to reconstruct your teeth.  I would recommend a prosthodontist specialist. robbie: hi thanks for taking the time to reply I have my concerns how its going to be possible to incorporate the missing tooth. have sent pictures over to dentist in turkey and she said no problem she will forge it the missing incisor ? she also mentioned adjusting the front side to incorporate missing incisor ? have enclosed pics of bite . really grateful for your help . thanks honestdoc: You have both Left & Right posterior crossbite.  I would recommend seeing a crown and bridge specialist (prosthodontist) because any work may have a high chance for failure like broken crowns, TMJ problems and pain, and unpleasing esthetics.  It's going to require a lot of work and expense.  Only go for the experts (expensive).  If you go cheap (less experienced, short cuts) it will fail miserably or just leave it alone. robbie: the dentist in turkey seems highly experienced and quoted a price of £4000 which was 26 crowns. in your opinion would you say to leave things as they are ? would an upper jaw implant be a good option ? sorry for all the questions but I don't want to spend a lot of money to create problems for myself . thanks for your help honestdoc: What was your reasoning for treatment?  As long as all your teeth have no cavities, and your gums and bone are healthy, I would leave it alone. 1) Your dentist will have to drill on your teeth to put crowns in. When the dentist drills on your teeth, the nerve (pulp) gets traumatized and you can have a lot of sensitivity afterwards. 2) Your bite is in crossbite. That means the dominant areas of your teeth are in different positions and when you chew, it can place a lot of stress in awkward pressure points. When you have tooth colored (porcelain) crowns, the porcelain can get cracked and damaged due to the awkward pressure points. Once the dentist starts to mess with it, there is a high risk of problems I've mentioned. robbie: hi, the only reason was vanity I suppose and to try and create a full smile. the dentist in turkey mentioned she would use zirconia crowns which are stronger and more durable by all accounts. in my online research dentistry in turkey seems more advanced than in the uk would that be true ? going to have a long think about this as don't want to create any major problems. would an upper mouth implant be an option or is that still going to create problems ? thanks for all your advice honestdoc: I'm in the US.  Zirconia is a very strong product with 2 disadvantages from my observations.  1)  Zirc is not as esthetic as eMax although modern Zirc have improved. 2) Zirc can still crack.  It is a hard decision.  Have your dentist do a mock up of your ideal smile (you may have to pay for the labor). robbie: thank you your help is much appreciated. just a final question …. would mouth implants be an option or would I still have problems ? thanks honestdoc: robbie said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tthank you your help is much appreciated. just a final question …. would mouth implants be an option or would I still have problems ? thanks\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\n\nImplants are great for missing teeth.  I didn't notice you having missing teeth other than the front incisor being closed by the canine.  Having implants can be tricky.  I've seen many implants fail with bone damage.  I recommend it be done by an experience surgeon and restored by an experience implant restorative dentist."

I can't tell what your bone and posterior teeth looks like and you're not biting correctly.  You need a comprehensive exam that looks into any cavities, bone and gum health and no abnormal TMJ, parafunctional habits, head, neck and mouth diseases.  If no problems exist, you may discuss cosmetic options as well as possible orthodontic evaluation.  Looks like you have anterior crowding and the orthodontist may recommend some teeth extractions to make room for proper teeth alignment.  Afterwards, you may need to wear retainers for life.

The dentist will need to evaluate your bite.  If your bite is very tight with limited vertical space, metal frames would be more sturdy and less likely to break.  Usually the upper bony ridge does not flatten as much as the lowers so hopefully there is enough anatomy to work with."

I ate on the other side of my mouth, I have had a few sips of cold water and the tooth/filling area was deffo sensitive same with warm tea, not enough to say full pain but enough to register the sensitivity.\n\nI looked online and all the Dentists have shut due to the virus. Does anyone know when they will reopen for patients to phone up and get an appointment for a new filling?\n\nI will be brushing twice a day, no fizzy drinks just water and tea, swishing around salt water and using mouthwash after each meal, I will also be using sensodyne repair and protect toothpaste, after I have cleaned them I will just put some of that toothpaste on to the tooth. \n\nwhat else can I do?"

I'm still getting pain, mainly when I chew any food on that side... I'm trying to figure out what the problem is as my Dentist keeps sending me away and telling me to wait but nothing is changing.\n\nSome thoughts: when i poke the tooth with my finger, it seems to hurt most when touching the edge closest to the front of my mouth (so the edge which is sitting adjacent to the next tooth). When having the filling done he REALLY forced something between the gap to protect the neighbouring tooth. Can some damage of been done at this moment? When I floss between the same gap - its extremely painful, more so than chewing.\n\nI told these things to my dentist and he was just confused. A recent x-ray shows a wisdom tooth is very close by and potentially pushing. However I would have to say I've had wisdom tooth pain before and this feels different - and also I was fine the day before the filling.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas? / Had a similar experience ? honestdoc: Could you provide an x-ray of the filling.  Did your dentist check how the bite is on the filling?  It is impossible to guess the source of your pain. ashleyg92: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCould you provide an x-ray of the filling.

MattKW: Very hard to be sure without a pre-op Xray at the least. However,.... white fillings can cause much more post-op sensitivity than amalgams if the filling is too shallow or poorly bonded. Without more info, my initial suggestion would be to have it replaced with an amalgam. After all, it's in an upper back tooth, so aesthetics doesn't come into it. The wisdom tooth won't be the issue. ashleyg92: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tVery hard to be sure without a pre-op Xray at the least.

However I was able to grab a picture of my most recent X-ray. I was wondering with this would either of you be able to shed some more light on my situation please.\n\nSince my last post - I've had the white filling removed and my Dentist added some sort of 'sensitive blocker' and a temporary filling for now and the next 6 weeks. The X-ray was taken after the white filling was removed. I've added in an arrow to indicate where the origin of the pain is when eating.\n\nThank you very much both of you. honestdoc: I think it is the proximity of the cavity/filling near the nerve (pulp) that is causing you pain/sensitivity.  Have your dentist put in a pulpal protectant such as Lime-Lite by Pulpdent and fill it with Fuji Equia glass ionomer.  Glass ionomer has the best desensitizing properties. MattKW: This is after the white filling was removed and before the temp was inserted? Or is this with the temp inserted? Looks like some decay there.\nHave you asked the dentist about an amalgam?\nMostly agree with honestdoc about putting in a GIC temp like a Fuji product. I'd put a smear of a corticosteroid \"Ledermix\" as a lining which will reduce the symptoms quickly."

He didn't give me a choice, but I didn't think to question it at the time.  Now that the crown is ready, I'm suspicious. Would he have to grind the tooth down farther to put on a white crown?  The tooth never bothered me until he worked on it. honestdoc: He wanted your money.  He didn't give you a choice and you had no problems. MattKW: Any grinding would have already been completed. It will probably be a zirconia crown which has become increasingly the norm. they are much stronger than the old feldspathic porcelains we used to use.

    "dialogue": "Nuluvius: I wanted to ask for some advice on where to even begin with this set of problems.\n\nI have lost UR 4, 5 & 6, UL 6 & LL 6. The bone on the right side has begun to atrophy and this is resulting in slippage of the surrounding teeth. Debris and decay are beginning to set in on my front teeth and the molars behind the gap. On the left side, bone atrophy induced slippage has resulted in the decay of UL 5 requiring a root canal.  This root canal work has now failed and there is a chronic infection at the apex (see below). To further compound things, the crown on that tooth has recently broken off, likely due to the slippage on that side. My general dentist has said that the crown itself cannot be salvaged but that at a cost of ~£1700, a post crown could perhaps be fitted, this is in addition to the risk of a re root canal on that tooth.\n\nI have been told that I could have UL 5 extracted but that due to the infection and prior bone loss resulting from missing UL 6, I would require a vast amount of grafting to place an implant - indeed there was some question as to whether it would even be possible at all. Also as if that were not bad enough, I have been told that I will likely experience facial sinkage due to the bone loss around my cheek on one side and indeed later on on the other side i.e. I will end up with an asymmetric face!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have approached many dental practices about this situation.

The first problem is that it is very hard to find a dental practice with all of the specialists in one place.

    "dialogue": "Whatteeth: For years, I've been missing most of my teeth. Gradually, another crown, and another, come off.\n\nI went to UCSF, and they recommended I have all my teeth extracted, and if I want the best option, implants.\n\nThey are somewhat limited on the services they offer, and I didn't feel they're the best pick for completing the service necessarily.\n\nI recently went to a new dentist about a dental infection, and her first reaction was, I should see someone about trying to save my two front teeth. I asked her, but it having my teeth all extracted and implants is the best solution, can I keep those two, which I'd like if I could? She then changed to 'no, you can't keep them'.\n\nOptions include:\n\n- Try to find a well-reviewed local Periodontists for all the work. Pro: likely good quality. Con: expense - I've heard of estimates up to $100,000.\n\n- Clear Choice implants - I've heard of estimates around $60,000. Pro: 'good enough' quality? Con: corporate, less personal, still expensive.\n\n- Foreign dentist office: almost impossible to feel I can select the 'right' one for quality. Pro: savings, value Con: difficult selection, risk of problems\n\nOne option: a local consultation. Even that has issues. Who is the 'right' periodontist to get a consultation from? Everyone seems to have their own biases (how likely is a local provider to suggest a foreign office if it were the right choice?) and 'networks' of contacts they prefer for their own reasons.\n\nI'm sympathetic - they all feel they're providing a good service for good value, but they're not all the best choice.\n\nMost of the progress I've made is that for years, I had the idea that 'implants' meant getting every tooth replaced by an implant tooth, while this year I learned that's not much recommended, that it means getting about 6 'posts' and implants are sort of like dentures on them.\n\nAnd then there are still more options - should I get removable or non-removable implants, for example? How can I get the longest-lasting solution?\n\nYou get the idea. All this has kept me from resolving this, but it's getting where it's pretty problematic for me to not get this done.\n\nI'd like to find quality advice for a 'last chance' for any option to save any teeth and confirm a plan, even if the likely 'all teeth removed, get implants', and to figure out how to find the right option for which office - local or foreign - to use.\n\nI could do this today if I 'just pick' any of the above - just go local, just go to clear choice, just go to a foreign office. But of course that would not let me feel I was avoiding lower quality/lower value/higher risk. So, any ideas how to get the best advice and solution to selecting an office? MattKW: Photos, Xrays? Which \"two front teeth\" - upper or lower? Whatteeth: The two front teeth - now one with a veneer - are upper. But that's not what the thread is about. MattKW: Sure, but in the absence of Xrays etc, it gives me an indication of your teeth problems, which sounds largely perio-based. So I would go to a periodontist or two for opinions.  Patients who have had periodontal problems are not always suitable for implants unless very well maintained, so this is where you should start. A proper assessment of all your teeth and a frank discussion about your situation. Maybe implants are just not for you. Whatteeth: Most of my teeth are broken off at the gumline, except some crowns, some teeth in quite bad shape (blackened), the two top front teeth, one left with a veneer but both 'shaved' for the veneers into little spikes, maybe a couple others partially broken off.\n\nTo find a good periodontist for a consultation, I'm expecting them to have biases such as being negative about international offices; the only way I'd know to find one pretty much is google and read reviews.\n\nI could ask a dentist for a recommendation but again, they tend to have relationships that might make them recommend someone because they help each other. MattKW: OK, so you're at a loss for saving any strategic teeth, in which case a full clearance is the way to go. \nYou know as much as anyone that internet reviews and testimonials are unreliable. Seeking an international dentist that way is no netter than looking locally. I have seen patients come back from overseas tourist clinics with stuff that I don't even recognise, and then they expect someone to fix it. It can often end up having everything removed.\nI also think you're a bit harsh about why dentists refer to certain specialists - I refer to the ones that act as an extension of my practice, and if I get negative feedback I let the specialist know or I simply stop using them. I have done this to a periodontist, a paedodontist, an orthodontist, and an oral surgeon.\nI always use a periodontist colleague to do my implant surgery because they handle soft and hard tissue well. Oral surgeons tend to be a bit limited in soft tissue skills for my liking. If you are going for a major rebuild with implants, then a large specialist practice with a periodontist, oral surgeon, and prosthodontist will give you the best result. But you'll pay for what you receive. Your first step is going to see if your ideal treatment is even possible. Whatteeth: It'd be great if there was a way to save teeth. Not looking promising.\n\nThere's a big difference for me between 'not getting complaints' and 'finding the best office to use'.\n\nBut it sounds like a periodontist consultation is a good idea; but I have little more to go on than 'search for nearby periodontists'. I drove by one today. As for where I'd actually want to go for treatment, the OP describes that. Whatteeth: I got a 'pano' xray done today. MattKW: OK, all upper teeth hopeless and lower teeth not far behind.\nSimply, I'd suggest extraction of all teeth, then get upper and lower full dentures while it heals up over a 3 month period.\nIf you still want to look at implants, you appear to have enough bone so a fair possibility. I would have to wonder why your teeth became so badly damaged initially with multiple decay, root canals, and crowns. Maintaining implants can also be difficult and gum infections (peri-implantitis) is more likely than with real teeth. So if your hygiene and diet has been a problem in the past, then implants may be a high-risk procedure for you. Whatteeth: As to why so many problems, I'd cite two things: a lack of brushing, and dry mouth for unknown reasons.\n\nThat might make implants risky, but I'm not sure of a better option. I guess removable or not is one choice.\n\nSo, that's part of what's going on.\n\nBut my main topic for the thread was the difficulty in choosing an office. Whatteeth: How is the quality of the pano xray? They did it where the machine pushed into my shoulders twice, making me move my head, so I wondered if it came out ok.\n\nIs $600 ok for synthetic bone grafts? The local dentist is going to do some extractions and that's the bone graft price. It seems probably just a little high, but it's gonna add up with 'all teeth' extracted to what, ~$20k just for bone grafts? MattKW: Have the extractions without grafts, then heal, then go to a periodontist for evaluation. If you have poor hygiene and dry mouth (undiagnosed), then implants won't be the correct choice. Whatteeth: I've read that bone grafts are recommended for extractions, as well as needed for implants? Whatteeth: I have an appt Monday so it's an $1800 question on the bone grafts, if she takes out the expected three, hm. MattKW: I think it's wasting your money when you are nowhere near ready for implants and will be wearing dentures for some time. Whatteeth: Don't bone grafts have to be done at the time of extraction? Aren't I close to 'ready' for implants, in terms of just extractions, heal, implants? MattKW: No, and no. Healing is 3 months. Are you going to walk around gummy? Whatteeth: The dentist today said $14,000 for all the grafts; that one tooth can be extracted without a graft; and that she won't do just that one, it's all or none. She referred me to somewhere I might have the grafts insured, I'll call them tomorrow and see.\n\nAs for walking around 3 months gummy - haven't really thought about it, you see the current situation. I could go either way, I'd probably get the temporary dentures if insured, but not spend thousands to have them for 3 months.\n\nThe dentists said 1 upper and about 4 lower teeth could be saved, and she doesn't recommend saving the one upper. That's more optimistic than I heard from from UCSF (and you suggested pretty much remove them all also).\n\nI'd love to keep any I can, but understand that also conflicts with the 'good' solution of complete implants, I guess the alternatives are partials which don't seem like a good idea... So I might try to consult with a Periodontist, but have to find a good one.\n\nShe suggested one she uses... considering a foreign office, for the quality solution/affordability... $60-100K here total? MattKW: You need to get an opinion other than $14K for all grafting. You won't know the costs here unless you at least get a consultation.\nI'm done and I'm bowing out. Good luck. Whatteeth: Thanks for replying Matt. It looks like you're the only person participating here. As I said, I am planning a consult with a Periodontist, just need to select one."

MattKW: Sometimes you can do a subgingival amalgam without removing the crown and all that, altho there may be some gum irritation; it depends on the case. Get 2nd opinion."

    "dialogue": "joey: I recently had a crown installed on a tooth on the lower left side of my jaw.   It feels large to me and has pushed the left side of my mouth out some to the left.\nThe crown overlaps the tooth behind it which makes flossing different from flossing the other teeth.\nThe dentist insists it's the right size.\nDoes this crown meet professional dental standards? MattKW: Did you have the nerve removed from this tooth? It looks like the root canal may have been accessed.\nBack to your question: Firstly, these Xrays are not exactly taken at the same angle, so it's a bit hard to compare fully. That said, it's not a great crown - the gum margins are not well defined. It's workable if you can keep it clean. Whether it has pushed other teeth is impossible to say from Xrays alone.\nI find it odd that you have kept that tilted wisdom tooth, and then placed an implant in the constricted space. This has meant that the implant crown has had to be made a less-than-ideal shape and angle, which has then complicated the shape of the new crown. It might've been better to extract the wisdom tooth, then put in a single upright implant with a larger crown. joey: The nerve was not removed from the tooth.  The  crown on the tooth forward of the implant crown significantly overlaps the implant crown on the cheek side of my mouth.  I have to place floss at a very odd angle to get it between the large crown and the teeth on either side of the crown.\nI was given two treatment options for the tooth behind the implant: remove the front part of the tooth\n or remove the entire  tooth then replace it w/ two implants.   Neither option appealed to me. \nIn March of this year the tooth behind the implant was removed and a bone graft placed in the socket. last month I was told the bone graft is doing well.   I don't know when the implant post will be installed and cap placed on the post.  How much time usually elapses between a bone graft and placement of an implant stem?\n\nThanks MattKW: You are reaping the consequences of not removing the 2nd molar earlier. If you hadn't wanted to do that option, I would've refused to place an implant, so he's a silly dentist for allowing you to dictate treatment.\nWhen the dentist says the graft is ready for implant, then you have the opportunity to correct this whole mess. I would suggest removing the crown on the 2nd premolar, and the current implant crown. The make 3 new crowns with better shape to complement each other. Whether this will be possible could be limited by the exit hole of the screw access in the current implant crown. You need someone with skill to look at this problem. joey: It's refreshing to get straightforward answers.  Thanks.  I wanted something done w/ the second molar but the options I was offered didn't sound right.    Replacing the crown on the implant might be a problem because while drilling the teeth on the left side to adjust the occlusion the l cheek side cusp was removed and they drilled down to the implant stem. Don't know how much of the stem was removed.\nI'm scheduled for January, 2020, to do bone grafts on the lower right side of my mouth.  Will try to see him before January 2020 to ask him to put an implant stem where the second molar used to be.\nI had a bridge in the lower right that came loose from the rear anchor tooth. The dentist did a root canal that tooth, when he cemented the bridge to the anchor teeth  and told me to bite down, the rear tooth scattered.  I was disgusted and only had a crown put on the forward tooth, the rear tooth was extracted  where the bridge used to be .To replace the bridge,  he wanted to place two 4mm implants in the lower right.\n4mm? that's .158 of an inch.   My current dentist wants to place two 6mm implants in the lower right.\n\n20213 Implant placed in mouth\n\n\n\n\nImplant 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter bone grafts  implants will be placed in lower right jaw joey: 2016 joey: broken anchor tooth #3 of three unit bridge.  bridge and broken tooth removed many years ago.\ncrown on remaining bridge anchor tooth replaced."

MattKW: Price sounds fine. I'm assuming this is the implant, abutment, and crown in total? Make sure you get a big brand that has a proven track record and will be around for a long time to come, and ask for genuine parts all the way through - they should be able to provide you with barcoded labels.

    "dialogue": "StayPuft: Hi everyone!\n\nSo, I originally went to the dentist because I had a toothache. The dentist said I might need a root canal, but put in a temporary sedative filling to see if the pain would calm down. The pain has progressively gotten better, but he keeps saying wait to put a crown on to make sure the pain has subsided. That's fine, but I'm not sure how long this temporary filling will last. What's a reasonable estimate so that it doesn't just wear out on me and I get that tooth reinfected again before I have a chance to get a crown done? FYI, the filling is the furthest back molar on my bottom left teeth.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAlso, on the furthest back molar on my bottom right teeth, an old filling has apparently come out. You can see the big chip in my tooth in the picture. The dentist says I need a crown (instead of just a filling) for that, as well. What do you think? If I need a crown, will it be really bad if I wait a little while?\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBTW, sorry for the HUGE pics. I couldn't figure out how to shrink them. Busybee: Always best to try a filling to see if it works before cutting a whole load of natural tooth down for a crown.   I would go elsewhere to a more conservative dentist. MattKW: Busybee, you're absolutely incorrect, and you should keep your layperson anecdotal \"knowledge\" to less clinical problems; you are misleading the OP. \nMost often decay occurs in these places when the extraction of impacted wisdom teeth has been delayed. Fillings on the distal of 2nd molars will often lead to mesio-distal cracks of the teeth despite fillings, and ultimately result in extractions. Both of these teeth will only continue to function with crowns, and I would suggest full gold or zirconia. Busybee: Staypuft always seek a second opinion from a different dentist in the real world, rather than relying on internet advice from people who haven't seen your x rays. MattKW: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tStaypuft always seek a second opinion from a different dentist in the real world, rather than relying on internet advice from people who haven't seen your x rays.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nI don't need to see Xrays to know what's happening here; I've seen plenty like this case. The mere fact the OP has had distal caries in a lower left 2nd molar can only occur if there is (or was) a mesially impacted 3rd molar.\nAt least I'm a dentist with loads of experience, rather than a layperson with anecdotes. And second opinions are fine - from a dentist. StayPuft: thank you for the responses! Sorry, just saw them. I still have a little while until I see the dentist again, so I'll do more research and make a decision.\n\nDo you have any idea how long that temporary sedative filling might last in the first picture? I know it's not an exact science, but a rough estimate might be nice so I know how long I can hold off.\n\nthank you! MattKW: Impossible to say. Anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of years? But when they break, it's always too late. KVMCruces: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAlways best to try a filling to see if it works before cutting a whole load of natural tooth down for a crown.   I would go elsewhere to a more conservative dentist.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\n\nBusybee, you're not a dentist nor do you work in dentistry. \nYou're a person who isn't asking any questions about your own dental care, you just consistently give illegitimate advice to other patients who are actually seeking dental advice from actual dentists. \nJust because you've had work done to your mouth does not make you a professional. This forum is for PATIENTS to ask DENTISTS questions. If you're not a dentist then please don't advise anyone to do anything because you're doing more harm than good.\n\nAs a dental tech who is married to a retired dentist, it is so frustrating seeing your replies where you speak on subjects you have no knowledge about and constantly bash dentists and accuse them of being \"scammers\". I also find it ironic that you'd give advice to a patient to seek dental advice from a dentist \"in the real world\" rather than online, yet 90% of your dentistry knowledge comes from the internet. Hopefully one of the forum admins can resolve this issue. MattKW: KVMCruces said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBusybee, you're not a dentist nor do you work in dentistry...\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nYo, kick ass! Ian: I'm away for a few days, but when I return home I will be starting work on a site upgrade, as well as a set of guidelines and rules for the forum. I've been intending to do this for a couple of months now, but this will start ASAP.\n\nWe definitely need to address what happens when medical advice is provided on the site, and I suspect we'll need to tip the scales in a direction where only verified dentists can provide medical advice (but with a mechanism where others can still comment in plenty of areas).\n\nNext week, I'll get the ball rolling with a discussion on how members would like to see things function going forward. I've got a few ideas to suggest, but will want to seek significant input from active members on the site. Busybee: KVMcruises I am astonished by your post.   If a patient needs treatment there is no substitute for a face to face examination.\n\nI may not be a dentist (and if you check my posting history I have often stated that in my posts),  .I am not here in a professional capacity but I do work in healthcare regulation, and this  includes dental healthcare.   So I do understand very well how the sector works in my country and the standards that they are expected to uphold. \n\nMany patients come here seeking guidance on what to do next and I can certainly advise them on that.   In most cases you will see from my posts (including the one above which was so objectionable to you and others) that I have advised them to seek a second opinion.  That is always the correct advice where is there is a conflict between the patient's expectations and the outcome of treatment and this conflict is not being recognised by the care provider.\n\nI have not made the assertions against dentists that you state.  But I have confirmed that there is a great variability in the quality and approach to dental care between different professionals.\n\nIt's in fact a certified dentist here, Honestdoc who has mentioned several times that dentists in the US overtreat for financial gain. \n\nI'm a firm believer that conservative dentistry is the best approach and have underlined that in my posts  (including the one above).   Many patients may not have heard of the benefits of minimally invasive techniques or that it can save them from having more aggressive treatment.\n\nThere is nothing contentious in my original post on this thread.  The first sentence was an observation, the second sentence (to seek a second opinion) was my perfectly sensible advice.\n\nGood luck with running this forum as \"cilinician only\" advice Ian.   Don't forget that patients can also help each other as they are more objective about the profession.   I hope your panel of clinical experts will post in a more professional manner in the newly upgraded forum than I've seen on this thread!   Otherwise it will certainly put a few patients from going to the dentist. MattKW: No, Busybee.\n\nYour first post shows that you do not understand the clinical implications of this particular case. \n\nYour second reply looks like you were miffed that I spoke against you, so you implied that my opinion was doubtful. \n\n\"Conservative treatment is the best approach\" is a very broad statement that is misleading. What you were advocating in this case was obviously under-treatment, and those of us dentists with decades of clinical and teaching experience are way ahead of you. \n\nThe current British adherence to NICE Guidelines on wisdom teeth extractions is an excellent example of conservatism gone wrong as has been addressed by other British specialist colleagues. Work your way through the 56 pages if you can.\n\n\"Dentists in the US overtreat for financial gain\". Sure, there are some that do it everywhere, including UK and Aust, but that doesn't put your misleading opinions ahead of those of me, honestdoc, or KVMCruces. We aren't getting paid for our advice, and you are extremely annoying at times with your (frankly) stupid and ill-informed advice. \n\nAs I said in an earlier post, you are welcome to give general advice of a supportive nature, but far too often you delve into clinical issues that are way beyond your knowledge base of Dr Google. I would be more than happy to see you go to another forum as you appear to \"threaten\" in your last sentence. Ooooh, I'm worried. Busybee: MattKw  I've no idea what you are referring to in my last sentence?!  The newly upgraded forum will be this one. I am not talking about another forum.  You will presumably be one of the clinicians.  Perhaps the only clinician as I have seen you jump down the throats (no pun intended!) of fellow clinicians just as often as you've jumped down mine.   Such that very few of your fellow dentists post here any more.   From what I have seen your personal arrogance as an individual is as immense as your conviction that you are the only one that's right.    You don't seem to have noticed that there are many patients posting on here daily whose concerns are being ignored by any dental professional registered here.  Their posts take days to be answered (if they are answered at all).   They are anxious and need to feel that they are understood.    I've been taking the time to make them feel that they are heard in the hope that a dentist will turn up and give a more thorough clinical review.  Instead I get this nonsense! \n\nThere is nothing wrong with my original post on this thread.  The first part is an observation. The second part is very sensible advice, advice that you frequently give yourself after I have given it.  That goes for most of my posts on here. You parrot what I say very often.  Few are countered by you.  When they are countered it is with incredible rudeness and immature insults e.g. above.   \n\nYou may be gratifying your ego with such responses but you are not representing your colleagues in a way befitting to the profession .  A profession that has many members who are sensitive, kind and capable.  \n\nThere is no need to be so angry that someone is contradicting you.  My point was perfectly valid - you absolutely cannot diagnose without a full set of information and the best exam is one that is in person.   You do not have that in this case.   You are not superman.  I'm sure from what I've seen that you are technically a very good dentist.  But your chairside manner is terrifying.   Being a dentist is not just about good engineering skills.  It's about being kind and really listening to patients.    If you want to demonstrate those skills start with being kinder and more considerate in your posts.   Otherwise it just seems as though you come here to offload after a bad day in your surgery. MattKW: My chairside manner is quite fine in my postings to patients. But you are absolutely right that I am annoyed with you, and I make no apology. KVMCruces: BusyBee, obviously an exam with a dentist is best in person. I said nothing stating otherwise so I'm not quite sure why you're so \"astonished\", it must be the shock from being called out on the forum...yet again. \n\n\"I may not be a dentist .I am not here in a professional capacity\" - THIS EXACTLY. You're not a dentist nor do you work in dentistry. I don't think anyone here is saying its a \"clinical only advice lan\" but there certainly needs to be boundaries for when its appropriate for you to insert your advice & you've overstepped those boundaries plenty of times. Not to mention the constant bashing of dentists only causes more stress & anxiety to patients who already have Odontophobia. There are $h!tty money hungry dentists EVERYWHERE. As an American myself, I can agree that we have our fair share but not every single doc that isn't \"conservative\" is out to get you. I think this paranoia you seem to have might possibly be coming from your own traumatic dental experience(s) & I would strongly advise you to find someone to talk to. Any dentist/dental assistants/technicians that are in the field for the right reasons still continue their dental education even after receiving their degrees/licenses/certifications. We attend educational seminars & take additional courses so that we stay informed. So please try to understand why MattKW or myself is quite irritated with you constantly dishing out illegitimate advice or even arguing with dental professionals. \nAs for patients having to wait a few days for advice... as MattKW stated previously, nobody gets paid to be on here. The dentists on here are probably busy seeing patients throughout the day & the dentists that usually do help can only answer so many questions in a day. However, that doesn't mean you start giving out mediocre advice. You can simply say that it usually takes a couple days for a response so if it's a big concern advise the patient to see a dentist \"in the real world\" like you said so yourself. \n\nI don't care to go back n' forth with you & I most definitely will not. An admin has already addressed it so I'll be looking out for updates on upcoming changes. \n\nMattKW - The forum is very dependent on dentists such as yourself and others like Honestdoc. If you guys weren't here it would literally be the blind leading the blind so thanks for not only sticking around but also putting up with... you know LOL. Busybee: KVMcruices if you \"don't care to go back 'n  forth\" (sic.) then do not post your impertinent opinions in the first place!   You're no dentist yourself.   You have in the past posted clinical advice which is outside the boundaries of your professional knowledge.   You've pretty much diagnosed conditions on here.    I've been far more careful in my own posts yet you call me out?!   Most of my knowledge comes from dental professionals and not the internet.\n\nBut that's all good because this forum currenly has no rules to say that advice has to be given by a dentist or that patients can only post questions.   If the forum rules here change then I will of course adhere to the new rules.  \n\nAs for dental professionals - it's two dental professionals = three opinions!   So you need an MDT to really be confident of a diagnosis and treatment plan.  That's why they now sway towards conservative dentistry in the UK.  You can always go forward slowly but you cannot go back.    Just as those UK citizens who were subjected to the antipodean \"dental trench\" in the late last century cannot go back to dental health... MattKW: KVMCruces said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBusyBee, obviously an exam with a dentist is best in person. I said nothing stating otherwise so I'm not quite sure why you're so \"astonished\", it must be the shock from being called out on the forum...yet again.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nThanks for your kind support, and rebuttal to BusyBee (what an appropriate name). I think it's ironic that Bb complains that dentists don't reply sooner on this forum - my own reluctance is to avoid getting into pointless discussions with an uninformed and troublesome person like Bb. I only step in when she starts giving incorrect clinical advice. If she continues to interfere and doesn't recognise when to back out then she'll be the only person left and it can be renamed the \"Bb ranting forum\". Cheers. KVMCruces: \"KVMcruices if you \"don't care to go back 'n forth\" (sic.) then do not post your impertinent opinions in the first place! You're no dentist yourself.

You cannot delete anything on here so if you actually looked at my past postings & you would clearly see that I've never diagnosed any conditions nor have I ever given clinical advice that was \"outside of my boundaries\". I also didn't post an opinion, I advised you to mind what you're saying to patients because you're in the habit of giving out mediocre advice. I was trying to be nice but you can't seem to take a hint. \nYou're not a dentist, RDA/RDH or CDT. STAY IN YOUR LANE little Busy Gnat. \n\nThe forum rules will be changed very soon & then you'll have no choice but to go find a hobby (one that you so desperately need). Toodle-loo 'till then"

Some dentists suggested that they don't deal with this kind of decays as they're very deep, the original dentist who did the tooth filling said that he can do it and another said that I need to have a root canal done first. I'm getting very confused because I'm getting different answers from everyone. I'd appreciate any other feedback that might help me which way to go about it MattKW: A few problems here:\n\nDeep decay, and there is a chance you might need a root Canal Therapy (RCT) after filling that; it'll come close to the nerve.\nA very difficult place to drill. Normally for decay like that the dentist would approach from the top because that's the easiest way with drills and handpieces. But that will probably be too far for the drill to reach. So, the dentist will either have to use long-shank burs (tricky to find) and drill a long hole straight down the back; OR he'll have to approach it from the side (my preference).\nThen he has to FILL it effectively. It's difficult at that depth, and I'd try amalgam if possible, or a GIC with applied pressure whilst setting.\nThis is why leaving impacted wisdom teeth in place is a tragedy; the adjacent tooth can be badly damaged."

Who here has had that done and can talk about what the journey is like? What did you do that worked?  What would you do differently if you did it all over again?  What results did you get? Busybee: That's a very radical approach.   Are you in the US? MattKW: Misaligned bites are not always harmful, so correcting them just because they're different is open to debate. Anyway, the usual 1st step would be to consider orthodontics. NiceSmile_off-center-bite: I came here to ask patients who have been through what I'm about to go through what I need to know.\n\nBut since they're not responding and I'm getting challenges from dentists, I'll ask you experts to indicate what options I have. Please respond quickly because I've got 48 hours in which to make initial decisions.\n\nThe primary problem is potential damage to the few teeth that take the brunt of the chewing load. The cause is an upper jaw that's V-shaped and a lower jaw that's U-shaped.  A secondary problem is TMJ tension and discomfort. The teragoids (sp?) are tight 24/7 and nightguards, physical therapy, acupuncture, and medication for focal distonia have hardly made a difference. On a side-note: I've always been a slow eater, and now I understand that it's because the upper and lower molars never meet and therefore it takes a lot more chews for me to process food. Thank G-d I enjoy food mindfully.\n\nI have a hairline crack in one tooth, which happened in an unusual incident trying to bite into a traditional hard cookie in a foreign country and I pulled on the cookie while biting. (Yes, I understand now that was a bad idea.) My dentist is worried that although that's a one-off incident it's also a harbinger of future damage. The jaw tension comes from muscles compensating for malocclusion. (I won't be able to explain the specifics of that.)\n\nJaw surgery and orthodontics were considered, but the difference between the shapes of the upper and lower arch are too different for either of them to work. Now I know why an orthodontist told my parents when I was a teen that braces for me would be much more expensive and uncomfortable than for other kids. They didn't do orthodontics back then.  After jaw surgery was ruled out by a highly regarded maxillofacial department at a highly regarded hospital in the large U.S. city where I live, my dentist suggested prosthodontics. Three prosthodontics clinics gave the same general solution: crowns on most or all teeth to even out the bite, stabilize the jaw's movement, and hopefully as a result also allow my jaw muscles to unlearn the need to stay tense.\n\nSo, in your countries, what treatment would solve malocclusion bad enough to cause tooth damage and jaw tension and pain?  I'm not interested in normative arguments about expensive U.S. healthcare and just interested in solutions and their attendant likely outcomes, risks, and risk prevention steps.

It is hit and miss and in order to place a crown your teeth are irreversibly reduced.   So you may find that you have problems now, but having a mouthful of crowns and a different bite could be a heap of new problems that are harder to fix.   What they should do is put on some temporary changes to see whether it fixes your bite.  There are ways to do this without going all the way.  You just need a patient dentist that is happy to see you through this journey.   You should be reasonably confident that this will work before you start.

    "dialogue": "i_am_bojangles: Hello everyone,\n\nI have 4 crowns in the top front of my mouth (7 through 10) made using emax in 2012 when I lived in Colorado. I was very pleased with the initial work and color of the crowns (I went into the lab to assist with shade/style matching) - they had good transparency, great layering/shading that made the teeth look quite natural. However, I need to have the center two (8 & 9) replaced soon (one chipped and for the other I had to have an implant put in). I have now moved to Virginia and my current dentist uses a lab based out of California because apparently she wasn't pleased with the quality/consistency of local labs in the area. (Side note: I did have to replace #9 two years ago due to it cracking and had that work done at a local lab, and the color match was good, but I really didn't like the dentist so had moved to another dentist in the area.)\n\nI'm wondering if there are any tips or suggestions for what can be done for the best match to the existing crowns on 8 & 9. My current dentist has taken a lot of pictures so far, but I would normally feel best going directly into a lab, however, flying out to California just for this isn't too likely.\n\nThank you for any tips or suggestions you can offer!\n\n(I've attached some pictures of what was in there before I had the impact put in for #9). MattKW: Lots of photos with shade guides alongside. And when the old crowns are removed, send them to the lab with the master impression."

So there may be hope??\nEven though I can't find much evidence of reviving a grey tooth online. MattKW: Even though the tooth looks calcified, the nerve may still be alive. Putting extreme cold on it will sometimes make it react, showing it is still \"alive\". The calcification is the reason for the darkening, but doesn't mean the nerve is necessarily dead. Over time, sometimes the calcification becomes such that there is not enough blood supply, and the tooth undergoes a sterile death (no bacteria). It may still not give you trouble. the only true indication of it being dead is if it starts to develop a darkness on the Xray at the tip of the root. This is out of your hands, and nothing you can do can change what is happening. It may not get worse, but it certainly won't get better.\nIf you are wanting to put a crown on this tooth to make it look better, then go ahead. Existential Tooth: Hey forgot to mention some thanks for all your support folks!\nI've been back to another dentist which seems a bit hassled to give me my x-rays but as far as I remember there didn't seem to be much darkening at the tip of the root.\nAlthough there was a bit of confusion as to which one is discoloured as the right is slightly yellowed \nBut I just wanted to ask about my best option now. I've heard of this procedure called bonding and contouring which they can not only smooth out the broken bottom but take a minimal layer of the front and composite fill to give them a better appearance (than one grey, one slightly yellowed). Crowns and veneers don't appeal and bleaching I'm not sure would do a very affective job. Any advice much appreciated!"

I want your professional opinion on what's the best restoration option for my case (resin, amalgam, inlay, onlay, crown, or any other).\n\nBy best, I mean the most conservative and durable one. From what I've read (I'm no dentist), I'm considering an amalgam, taking into account its durability, conservativeness  and the big hole (sorry for the non-technical term) in my tooth. I understand the amalgam is better vs. the resin in cases such as this, but I'm not so clear on why not choosing the other options, so far I'm preferring the amalgam for the sake of conservativeness, but I'm here to reach out to you guys, to see if you can change my mind. I also understand (not completely) the state of the cusps has something to do with it.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nJohn.\n\n\nEdit: I just found out gold fillings exist, now I think that'd be my best choice. What do you think? John_D: One last pic: MattKW: At a minimum you would shorten the cusps and fill the entire pulp chamber and over the cusps with amalgam. Composite is a useless material for these things - you've gone to a lot of effort to redo this RCT, and I would go for strength and durability over appearances any day.\nUsually, I'd put in a wrought stainless post or two as well, but your canals have been heavily flared so this would be risky. \n\nHowever, if you can afford it, I'd do a cast gold post-and-core so that the gold snugly fits in the farthest back canal (distal canal), then a porcelain-fused to gold crown with 2-3mm gold margins for best fit and cleansibility. No-one will see the small gold margins back there. \nAs an aside, you have a large amalgam in the upper right tooth. That would benefit from a crown or fractures are possible.

I think I'll go for gold.\n\nHowever, given the amount of lost tooth, can I still opt for a filling or inlay? or an onlay/overlay?\n\nHow many cusps remain in the tooth? 3? 2? none? MattKW: An onlay would be OK. You basically have only 2 cusps left, and if they fracture, the fractures usually go deep under the gum and the tooth has to be extracted. Don't risk it - those cusps have to be covered (onlay or cusp-capping) or enclosed (crown). John_D: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAn onlay would be OK.

According to \"Effect of different onlay systems on fracture resistance and failure pattern of endodontically treated mandibular molars restored with and without glass fiber posts.\" By Zalameh et. al. (2010):\n\n\"Statistical analysis showed that restoration of endodontically treated teeth with gold onlays improved fracture resistance when compared to glass ceramic or resin composite onlays. The presence of a fiber post significantly improved (P<0.045) fracture resistance of gold onlays from 2271 to 2874N while it did not influence the performance of the other two groups. Fractographic analyses revealed that the presence of fiber post resulted in more restorable fractures due to better stress distribution of the applied load.\"\n\nCan I still get this fiber post taking into account the heavy flaring you mentioned a few posts ago? Is this fiber a better material than any other post (gold, composite, etc.)? Does the cost of the onlay vary significantly with/without the post? (I have the quotation without already). MattKW: A fibre post won't work with your canal flaring; that's why I suggest a cast post which is tailor-made to fit the canal perfectly and without the need to drill away any root. Premade posts like fibre of stainless steel require that the canal be drilled to fit the shape of the post. With cast gold, you simply remove the root filling to the depth required, then take an impression, and the lab makes it up. Also, the core is part of the same casting, so you don't have a separate post and core; it's all one piece. Admittedly, not many young dentists are familiar with this technique. There is great difficulty comparing the systems in vivo because there are so many variables. The study you quote is in vitro and does not compare cast gold posts with fibre posts; it primarily compares different types of onlays with or without a post (in this case only fibre).

When you talk about post and core, are you talking exclusively about a crown (not an onlay)?\n\nIf I go to any prosthodontist and ask him for a gold onlay, am I all set? I mean: are all onlays made the same? Or must I ask specifically for an onlay consisting of a single piece gold casting (post and core)?\n\nI think I'm confusing onlay and crown terms... my bad. MattKW: The post is like the reinforcing bars that go into the concrete base (core) of a house. The post can be separate from the core (Usually), but can be a single casting.\nAn onlay is like keeping the original brick walls (your natural tooth) but placing a new roof over the walls. A crown is like replacing the walls and roof together (usually the case). John_D: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe post is like the reinforcing bars that go into the concrete base (core) of a house.

I'm relatively young (turning 30 in a month) also.\n\nFrom what I've read, an amalgam is better vs. a gold onlay to avoid microleaking. If I want the lesion to heal faster is it possible to get an amalgam first until the lesion heals and THEN get the definitive restoration? or this just doesn't make any sense at all?\n\nAs a definitive restoration, is a gold overlay any better than an onlay? Is it necessary in my case?\n\nIs an onlay the same as an \"endocrown\"? MattKW: Leakage or fracture? Equally important. Leakage will lead to re-infection of the canal; fracture will lead to loss of tooth completely.\nSure, things went well for 12 years fracture-wise, but it only takes 1 day for it to fracture. Actually had a patient this morning - I did the RCT 10 yrs ago, and she came in with hopeless fracture today. She never did the crown I'd advised. Now it'll be an implant.\n\nThe most likely penetration of microleakage is through the core, which is partly why I don't do composite cores. A gold post/core, or amalgam core will equally stop microleakage.\nSure, get the amalg first if you want, but don't leave the cusps unprotected. Either reduce them and cover with amalgam, or at least place a long-term temp crown (a bit of a waste of time IMHO).\nI have misguided you in the terminology - sorry. I mean to do either an overlay or a crown (forget onlay). If you are going to do full gold, then an overlay would be OK; if you do a crown, then either full gold or porcelain fused to metal.\nDon't even worry about endocrowns. I had to look that one up, and it just introduces all sorts of technical problems and I can't see any benefits. John_D: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\nLeakage or fracture? Equally important.

I can ask the Dr. who retreated me for a new temporal cementation. Considering a tentative end of July date for the definitive restoration, is it better to get an uncovered cusps amalgam ASAP? or is this \"re-cementing\" enough?\n\nDid the retreatment introduce a fracture? I noted right in the center of the after image (first post, second image) something like an X figure (a crack?) between the 3 root fillings. I'm actually feeling a little achey (before retreatment, it was a 1/10 ache on any random day, now it's the same but it increased to a 1.5/10) MattKW: Amalgam will be fine as long as you reduce and cover the cusps; then go to crown later.

There is no crack.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\n\nI'm getting the amalgam tomorrow. I've been reading about the overlay and I got some interesting quotations regarding the restoration of a RCTed teeth. I have yet to understand the gold overlay process, if it implies a simple casting piece including the post, if the post can be avoided, what's the best cementation, etc. also what's the way to perform the procedure:\n\n\" A ferrule of 1-2 mm of tooth tissue coronal to the finish line of the crown significantly improves the fracture resistance of the tooth and is more important than the type of the material the core and post are made of\"\n\n- Hmmm... interesting...\n\nfollowed by this:\n\n\"The most important factor influencing whether a post will be necessary is the amount of supporting tooth structure remaining after crown preparation and the development of a ferrule. If three supporting walls of dentin remain, a post is not necessary. All metal posts, regardless of design or type of cement used, transmit forces developed during mastication to the root of the tooth, and thus, can promote fracture over time if the root is structurally compromised.\"\n\n- Does my tooth have three supporting walls of dentin? or were all removed for the treatment? Does the affirmation about metal posts include the one you mentioned earlier in the gold casting?\n\n\"By tradition, some dentists continue to use metal posts to retain bonded composite restorations while they accordingly should be replaced by fiber-reinforced resin-based posts which are more protective of remaining structure; or possibly by no posts at all. This is supported by the fact that a ferrule should be obtained on all endodontically treated teeth. If a 2 mm ferrule can be obtained for any protective restoration, a post is not needed to obtain a bonded buildup. A ferrule is generally considered to be extremely important to prevent dislodging forces that will lead to coronal leakage. Cusps should be covered if structural loss has damaged marginal ridges or undermined coronal walls.\"\n\n- OK, I get it. I must cover 'em cusps! Now regarding the ferrule, Can a 2mm one be obtained from my tooth?\n\nAnd the final one:\n\n\"...This research suggested the following: access opening (5% reduction in stiffness), occlussal preparation (20%), loss of one marginal ridge (46%), loss of two marginal ridges (63%); thus, the conclusion to preserve marginal ridges whenever possible.\"\n\n- Is my tooth then at 63% (or more) of stiffness lost? What's the probability of a fracture following the retreatment? In a year? 5? 10? 20? ...50? John_D: Oh... I forgot: Is it possible to get the amalgam (and later the overlay) without reducing the cusps? If not, does it make any difference to reduce them for the amalgam, before getting the overlay? I remember reading something about how the amalgam requires more tooth to be removed. John_D: I just got the amalgam. The bad news is the Dr. (not the endodontist who treated me initially) noticed a fracture line inside my tooth. He handed me the mirror to show me the line but I couldn't see anything, really. He was using small magnifying binoculars and asked me if the endodontist used any magnification. I said no and he patted me in the back... I may (may?) have cracked tooth syndrome. I can actually tell the 1.5/10 pain is \"different\" from the pre-treatment pain, it feels a little more on the upper side, and as the symptoms of the syndrome say, the pain comes and goes.\n\nHe then reduced the cusps to flatten out the tooth, and when I told him I was considering a restoration with a post, he literally said \"No ****ing way!!!\" as he proceeded to explain me how the post would increase the fracture, doing an analogy with construction stuff, and further mentioning something about the gold overlay where the forces would not balance out in a hard surface, considering the new found fracture. The thing we don't know is if the fracture actually goes deeper than the cementing (not the amalgam) I have right now. Can I find this out with X-rays? dyes?\n\nHe also told me to use glass ionomer for the cementing of the restoration (a crown), as it is the best material to avoid a major fracture."

    "dialogue": "Qu3stionmarx: Hello y'all \nI'm a 5th year dental student and last week I was doing an anterior restoration of a hypoplastic enamel lesion on tooth no 10. I thought it would be a good idea to test different shades on the minimal preparation I made without etching\\bonding so I would be able to remove the composite after I light-cure it. One of the doctors told me that I'm introducing contamination into the preparation every time I place the composite on the enamel. She continued her scolding by saying that it could seriously affect bond strength and color. She said I would have to remove additional enamel to get rid of the supposed contamination. Obviously, everything placed on the enamel other than the definitive restoration is considered a contaminant, but is it really the case with composite? My assumption was that by etching the preparation (once I found the right shade), every contaminant would be neutralized. I tried to find research to answer the question but turned up empty handed. What do you think? honestdoc: You're right about the etching removing contaminants.  Some dentists use Chlorhexidine before acid etching.  If possible, don't work with this dentist/instructor.  If unavoidable, add a small amount of composite on an instrument and match it against the tooth without putting it on the tooth.  You may speak with this instructor's supervisor that she has no scientific basis for her scolding. MattKW: Have you noticed how easily the composite flicked off when you'd finished the comparison? Your tutor is wrong, go talk to the lecturer of restorative treatment. If you really wanted to be sure of cleanliness, then some plain pumice would scrub off anything.\nIf I have a patient with multiple diastemata I want to close using composite, I will often do a quick mock-up in composite so they can see the colours and altered sizes before committing to a treatment. I will place plain bonding liquid on the unetched surfaces for a bit more grip, but it still flicks off with slightly more effort."

Can anyone advise?\n\nMy dentist is now reccomending an onlay  for this tooth and suggests it should be done quikly since they say they can see decay between the tooth and the filling.I have no pain or issues with it.I'm wondering if it's it's necessary or if there's a keeness to cover things up so to speak.\n\nIs an onlay the best approach or can it be left as is?

To fix it at the time the dentist filled and smoothed the area that had broken off.   I always hated it and ten years later I had a gold onlay, which lasted decades and was very strong in comparison.   They tend to try to save the tooth with a filling in the first instance as more tooth has to be removed when you have an onlay.    In my case the filling had no problems once they fixed up the area where the tooth broke but it was not as strong as my other filled teeth and the bite was better with the onlay.  But in terms of dental health the amalgam filling my onlay replaced would have been fine too and may have lasted a lifetime.  Onlays don't always last for decades.

I think it was some kind of metal alloy IIRC.\n\nI did some research into the whole amalgam vs alternatives before but decided that it seemed ok. Busybee: It's possible your dentist thinks the tooth structure needs an onlay for long term durability, but you could ask whether they can do this without removing much tooth and perhaps using the existing amalgam filling as part of the support.  I had something like this done by a conservative dentist.   It meant that my tooth had reduced risk of a root canal as my dentist did not go near the nerve.  Otherwise if they don't have enough tooth they have to create a post to attach the crown or onlay.   Maybe worth looking for a conservative/minimally invasive dentist.   My main problem with the onlay was that after about ten or fifteen years it developed a gap between the tooth and the gold.  That allows decay to develop.    There are risks and long term issues with any dental work, but these days it's considered best to retain as much healthy tooth as possible, if it's feasible to do so and if it doesn't compromise function, durability etc.   . MattKW: The wisdom tooth is impacted down the back side of the 2nd molar, and should be removed before doing any more extensive work on the 2nd molar. I'd extract the wisdom tooth first, allow for healing, then place a crown over the 2nd molar. it is possible the existing filling needs to be replaced first if there is any chance of existing decay."

    "title": "Pain/Sensitivity after replacement filling",
    "dialogue": "Lesleyjane: Hello,\nI am in the UK and a couple of weeks ago I had three silver fillings replaced with white ones, just for cosmetic purposes. None of them had been giving me any problems at all.\nTwo of them are just fine, but after my appointment I felt that the bite on the third one was too high (the very back tooth in my lower left jaw). I got another appointment and my dentist fixed the bite so that I couldn’t feel it when I chattered my teeth together - I thought everything was fine.\nHowever, when I got home, I noticed that I was still getting that unpleasant sensitive pain when I chewed. It seems like if there is any pressure on the tooth, it’s extremely uncomfortable.\nI called my dentist and she told me just to take painkillers, eat on the other side of my mouth and not to eat anything hard.\nI have been doing that, but am still feeling that pain if I accidentally chew on that side of my mouth, and to add to it, I have started to get quite a painful jaw over the past couple of days too.\nMy dentist is on holiday at the moment so I wanted to ask if this is normal after a replacement filling? I have read that sometimes it can take a few weeks for a tooth to settle down - is that right? Could my jaw just be getting a bit sore because I haven’t been using that side to chew for a couple of weeks? Will this all go away or could something be wrong. I feel a bit confused because before I had the replacements, I had absolutely no issues at all.\nI have never really had any problems with my teeth before (and am really wishing that I had just left my silver fillings alone!) and I’m quite worried about this. I wondered if anyone might be able to help put my mind at ease.\nThank you very much. honestdoc: A lot of dentists in the US remove silver fillings and place white fillings even when there are nothing wrong.  I'm totally against unnecessary drilling for the reasons you are having.  The dentist that replaced your fillings needs to follow you up and understand the trouble you are experiencing.\n\nBest case scenario, your sensitivity and pain should subside."

    "title": "Precious vs. Non-Precious Metal Crowns",
    "dialogue": "SonicExplorer: <Question at the bottom in bold for those wanting to skip the preamble>\n\nOk, so I've been in a nightmare trying to get a rear molar dealt with and after finally finding a credible dentist I've been given two viable options.  1) Fill the tooth and take my chances it won't crack in a way that results in root canal or loss of tooth.  2) Crown it now with a metal crown with the understanding that, due to some fissures already in the tooth, there is no guarantee it won't still crack at some point down the road.  I'm leaning toward crown.  However, due to the \"coverage\" I have I am not offered the option of \"noble\" metal.  I have to either choose from high noble (precious - gold 64%) or base (non-precious alloy).  There is a big difference between them in price - about $300.  Now, normally I would pay the extra if I thought the tooth would last the remainder of my life, say another 25 years give or take.  BUT....the dentist is sort of guiding that it may be wise to consider saving that extra money because the tooth may not make even half that long without needing more work, there's simply no predicting.\n\nHere's the question:  Is non-precious / base metal usually safe from a health perspective??  Anybody have any thoughts to share on what might be the wiser overall choice between high-noble precious and base non-precious metal types?  \n\nThanks,\n\n     Sonic honestdoc: I've placed many non-precious alloy crowns.  Usually the metal nickel causes problems but to my knowledge, it is not a factor in many alloys.  As stated in my previous posts, you do not need high noble."

    "title": "Up-charge for crown ??  Does this sound right ?",
    "dialogue": "SonicExplorer: Hi,\n\nFirst timer with a pending crown.  Dealing with a dentist who's office is operating a bit shady. Paid for a 3rd party dental discount plan and when I get to the dentist the office manager targeted a crown code that wasn't on the plan. But I was ready and did my own shuffle by informing them I preferred a gold crown instead of the Zirconia they were pushing.  Metal crowns ARE listed on the plan at a 50% discount, which the dentist wasn't pleased about.  Then he grumbles...\"well, we are going to have to upcharge you for Gold, probably $100 to $200, depending on what the lab charges us.\"\n\nThe code is a 2790 which is a \"High Noble Metal Crown\".  This is by definition of the ADA already a crown of at least 40% gold.  So what is this dentist trying to pull?  Even if we moved up to a 70% gold content, it wouldn't likely run more than another $50 or so based on a variety of research I've done online.  (but correct me if I'm wrong)\n\nAny thoughts or recommendations on this situation?  How might I go about making sure I'm getting quoted appropriately and verify what exactly they are putting in my mouth, etc.  Without rocking the boat more than necessary.  Do I request the name of the lab, do I let them know in advance I expect to receive lab paperwork indicating the cost and content of my crown?\n\nThanks,\n\n       Sonic honestdoc: See another dentist.  That clinic is ripping you off.  You can consider \"Noble metal crown\" (lower gold content) instead.  Labs charge differently based on zip code.  If your zip code is in a less expensive housing area, you are in luck. SonicExplorer: As far as I am aware, if a person decides to go with gold, especially for rear chewing molars, it is best to target a content of at least 60% gold, preferably in the 70% range.  I believe it has to do with durability and hardness compatibility with opposing teeth so neither incur excess wear during chewing (or grinding) as can happen with other materials.   Again, keep in mind I'm a newbie on this crown stuff, but that's my understanding anyway.\n\nYeah, I could try another dentist but they ALL seem to be scammy in my area.  And none will give much in the way of discounts even for cash customers.  Worse yet, this particular dentist used some kind of high-tech Xrays that rendered on a computer - NOT conventional bite-wings and panoramas with film. So I suspect I'd have start all over and pay again for another Xray series and exam with another dentist. So I'd need to factor all that in as well.\n\nThe dentist walks in the room, consults with the hygienist for 10 seconds, looks in my mouth for literally no more than 10 seconds, says I need 4 crowns and walks out.  No exaggeration, this is exactly what happened. \n\n      Sonic honestdoc: You don't need higher gold content for durability.  More gold will soften the alloy.  A lot of my patients cannot afford high noble and I would use noble (semiprecious metals).  Dental x-rays are all digital now.  Nationwide, the dental supply companies stopped providing conventional x-rays supplies, equipment, and support.  Where are you located?  What are your priorities such as cost, location, scheduling, cosmetics? SonicExplorer: I'm still learning, but seems a Type III gold crown is most ideal for rear chewing molars.  That typically has about 65%-70% gold if I recall.  Seems high noble also tends to have less of the types of alloys that may lead to health issues or adverse reactions in some patients over the long haul.  Again, I'm just learning, doing a lot of reading, so if any of that is wrong please share your insight.\n\nMy priorities are to invest wisely to get the best balance of cost & durability over the long haul, without jeopardizing my health.  I don't care about cosmetics since all the crowns would be on rear molars.  One other note: I tend to grind my teeth at night apparently.  While I may get a guard, I'd like to make the best decision on crowns with that also in mind - so if a Gold Type III crown is not a wise choice the please let me know.\n\nBTW, I'm Central Florida.\n\nThanks,\n\n       Sonic SonicExplorer: Well, I found a much better dentist but am still encountering some questionable pricing from the office mgr.  Mainly the lab fee aspect again.  Some offices are doing \"upcharges\" for certain metal types while others are trying to pass on the metal charge plus lab mfr costs in one lump.  How do I find out what a total reasonable lab fee (material and labor) is for metal crowns??  $175 for a simple base metal crown seems steep and $375 for a 64% gold noble metal crown sounds really steep.   I suspect these fees are being inflated when instead they are supposed to be passed on directly to the customer (per my current plan).  I currently see no way for a patient to really know what the true lab costs are, and if a dentist is padding lab fees they certainly aren't going to show an invoice.\n\nAny suggestions on how to handle this situation?  Most every dentist office (and I've talked to dozens) clearly seem to be skirting the discount plan fee schedules on high price procedures by either targeting procedure codes not on the schedule or padding lab fees.\n\nSonic"

    "title": "Root Canal Questions - Detection and self-healing",
    "dialogue": "SonicExplorer: Hi,\n\nI have a slightly cracked molar with large filling and looks like I'm headed toward a crown. But the possible root canal aspect raises some questions....(the dentist I've seen did not indicate a root canal but did say the need is not always simple to detect)\n\nQuestions:\n\n- If there is no obvious symptoms after a moderate toothache resolves in a few days, how is the need (or not) for a root canal determined? It would be awful to get an unnecessary root canal and also awful to get a crown done only to learn shortly down the road a root canal should have been done.  Plus the possible health risks.   What are methods of detection and is there some kind of preferred approach such as using a temp crown for a few months to monitor before a final crown?\n\n- Why does most literature seem to indicate a tooth needing a root canal cannot be healed by the body?  What is so different about the bacteria that can kill off the roots in a tooth but the body cannot in turn eventually kill off that bacteria and instead necessitates the need for a root canal?  Or is this simply folklore propagated by the dental community in order to manage potential health-risk complications should the body be unable to fight the bacteria on it's own?\n\nThanks for any help in understanding these questions,\n\nSonic honestdoc: There are a lot of variables in determining whether a tooth needs a root canal.  Sometimes it is very easy...the tooth hurts, is sensitive to percussion while adjacent teeth have no problems, shows up on x-rays with a clear infection with history of deep cavity/filling/crown, and tests negative to cold test using very cold cotton ball instead of Q-tip.  Many times, it is not so clear.  I did do a temp crown on a dentist colleague to determine the tooth status before a final crown a few years ago.  \n\nNatural healing of the root canal can be unpredictable.  Inside the root canal, there are cells that form calcifications (secondary and tertiary dentin) to insulate and protect the nerve (nature's root canal).  If the pulp dies and becomes infected, the body cannot heal the tooth because the root canal is too small for proper vascular repair. In response, the surrounding bone softens in efforts to expel the tooth...(think Tom Hanks in the movie Castaway self tooth extraction).

I do notice pics of my grandfather(passed away at 73) and my teeth appear to look very similar to his.  My gums are receding so much that the discolored root is showing on front top teeth.  Significant bone loss is evident because I currently have several loose teeth.  I am devastated because I was always complimented on how pretty my teeth were when I was in mid 30's and younger.  I went to regular dental appts and had teeth cleaned on regular basis (at least yearly),  I went to a Periodontist and had deep cleaning and scaling as well.

Health insurance is over 600.00 a month and no dental insurance.  \nI am actually quite attractive for 53 until I smile.  I have bone loss so, I will need bone grafts implanted to grow so I may have support for any implants.  I guess at these ridiculous dental implant prices, I will have to buy one implant at a time. \n     I am a healthcare worker with a BSN and student loans and can barely support myself due to housing costs and youI have to have a vehicle in Jacksonville, FL area or you won't survive.  \n     I totally respect a professional's education and dedication to their profession but I feel like MDs and Dentists need to have caps on their prices for services. Ive seen a lot of bad insurance billing practices from Health Professionals in my 25 years as a RN. Ive also seen downright fraud.

    "dialogue": "leomoon: I had a new crown put on my upper right tooth furthest in the back. When I first got the crown put on, my bite felt way off, it was too high. so the dentist filed a bit to adjust it. on the way home I noticed a sharp jagged ridge on the back inside part of the crown and noticed it was very short crown in general, especially compared to the height of the same tooth only on upper left side.\nso I went back to dentist and explained that there was a sharp jagged ridge and she filed more of the crown to try and fix this. also polished it. this did nothing but I noticed there was even less tooth now to support my eating, etc it was short to begin with and now was even shorter. it felt like a little rough stub of a crown in the back. so I went back AGAIN and showed the dentist this and also that my gum was hurting and it hurt when I eat, I said I think too much of the crown was filed away it feels like there is a short stub of a crown left in the back and its still rough when I touch with my tongue. So he filed MORE of the crown in the back. and said oh it's your bite that was off, this should work. I said no it's not my bite!! it's a bad crown - he advised not to replace the crown it could damage my tooth underneath. and he won't give me a refund. so any suggestions on what to do now? i'm in pain and don't want to keep this horrible crown in my mouth.thanks Busybee: This is a really difficult situation because it's your word against the dentist's and any other dentist will look at the crown without knowing what was there before.  Whatever you do, don't let any dentist adjust your other teeth to compensate.  Get a second opinion.  Explain what has happened.   The original dentist should replace the crown, but do you really want someone who caused this mess to do any more work on your teeth?  It sounds as though they are using a sub-standard technician because if the crown had been made by someone skilled it would not have been so high.    This sort of problem is difficult to fix because you need a record of what was there before to see what's needed. MattKW: If you get no satisfaction from the dentist, you'll probably have to go to a local Consumers Protection Agency or the like to lodge a complaint. Or you could go through the local Dental Board. You can't tell if it's the dentist or the technician. Usually it's the dentist - the technician can only work with the models that the dentist provides. TALDDS: I think that you should approach the situation with reason.  Your end goal is to remedy your current situation, approach with reason and logic, if it is a sub par product any dentist would prefer to replace even if they have to incur a cost.  I would approach from a legal sense unless there is no other option to exhaust. Busybee: Legally it is the dentist's word against yours.  Dental negligence is very difficult to prove, particularly in such a case."

    "dialogue": "noesis: I have a broken cusp on a second molar, tooth #18. There is no decay on the tooth and it doesn't need a root canal treatment.\n\nA dentist who was recommended to me suggested fixing it with an onlay, which she described as a 3/4 crown. She will use either Cerec with Celtra Duo, a zirconia reinforced lithium disilicate material (milled and polished method), which has a flexural strength of 210 MPa. Or, I can get a lab made crown using traditional dental molds for the impression, with IPS e.Max, which has a strength of 360 MPa.\n\nWhen I asked about zirconia, ideally the translucent kind, which I understand is the strongest tooth-like ceramic (with a 600-750 MPa), this dentist said that she doesn't use zirconia.\n\nIf I have this dentist do my onlay, I am leaning towards e.Max because it has a longer track record and it is stronger than the Celtra Duo (when using the milled and polished method).\n\nPlease note that when Celtra Duo is glazed and fired, its strength increases to 360 MPa. However, this dentist doesn't fire the crowns. Overall, I am worried about trying either of the recommended ceramic materials because I think they are too weak and will break in a short time, if used on a second molar.\n\nTo complicate matters, I live in the Boston area where the cost of dental services is astronomically high and I have no dental insurance. So, I want the onlay to last as long as possible for both cost considerations and because I don't want to risk repeatedly drilling on the tooth, which might cause me to need additional dental treatment.\n\nCould there be a reason why a dentist would recommend weaker ceramic materials for a second molar when those materials are usually used for crowns in the front of the mouth? Should I go with the e.Max option? Or, should I find a dentist who uses zirconia for second molar crowns?\n\nAny information or advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated. MattKW: For 2nd molars I prefer to try and talk patients into a high-noble crown (white or yellow gold). The 2nd molars are typically quite short and you want to keep as much natural tooth structure for a sound foundation. A gold alloy \ncan be very thin, biocompatible, kind to opposing teeth, easy to adjust, and indestructible; but you have to be OK about the colour. 2nd choice would be monolithic zirconia as least destructive removal of tooth structure for max strngth. 3rd choice is monolithic eMax. If you layer a zirc or eMax there is greater risk of chipping. May not be significant, very hard to be sure when we start talking in MPa as a simple measure of estimating the overall strength of a restoration. noesis: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFor 2nd molars I prefer to try and talk patients into a high-noble crown (white or yellow gold).

    "dialogue": "pinkpotato: Sorry for the gross photos but hopefully they will be helpful! ....\nMy front tooth recently broke off, much of it breaking right up to the gum line. It had root canal over 10 years ago which was successful. The root canal still looks fine and there is no infection. An emergency dentist placed a temporary cover over the tooth, and this was partly taken off to take these photos. I think that some of the temporary cover is still visible in these photos as there seems to be more there than when it broke. The photos were taken to show to a prosthodontist and hopefully it's possible (for a dentist) to tell the difference between the cover and the remaining tooth.\nThe prosthodontist I saw said that it would be possible to do a post and crown but didn't give any percentages of how likely this would be to succeed. He did some checks of my bite, as I have a deep bite, to see if the tooth would have enough protection for a post and crown. He said that he thinks the tooth has enough protection to do the post and crown and that there is just enough tooth at the back to make a ferrel (?).\nMy situation is very much complicated by my medical situation in that I cannot take most antibiotics, including the dental ones like amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole. This means that getting an infection can be dangerous. The prosthodontist I saw thought that a post and crown would be lower risk than an implant, as the infections associated with post and crown going wrong as less severe, or less likely to need antibiotics than those associated with a implant. \nI trust that the prosthodontist I saw was good, but would like a second opinion as it's a complicated decision. If anyone has any opinions on any of this I would be very grateful to hear. honestdoc: I agree with the prosthodontist,  Post/core & crown would be the most conservative approach as opposed to implants.  Why can't you take dental antibiotics?  Could you take Clindamycin?  Usually you don't need to take antibiotics for most dental procedures. pinkpotato: Thanks for your opinion  I really appreciate it. I can't take antibiotics because I had severe Stevens-Johnson Syndrome following many antibiotics. They can't work out which one caused the reaction so it would be very dangerous for me to take them again as it's not really possible to control the reaction. Clyndamycin is a possible risk - I did take it at the time of my reaction but was given it after the reaction started so some doctors think it may be OK for me to take it and others think not. I don't know if there are other antibiotics which could be given intravenously for dental infections in hospital. I can take Doxycycline but I know that's not a great dental antibiotic.\n\nWith infection risk... I was worried with the post and crown of a infection later down the line if the root cracks, but hopefully it would be possible to extract without antibiotics if this happened. With a implant I was told they would usually be used prophylactically before the procedure and also if a flare up happened after it was placed. joss: Hi,\nI have already had 2 of these done, and am working on #3 and #4. Number three is not as co-operative as I had to have that tooth scaled due to sensitivity, and the dentist found a lot of gum tissue that was not healthy that had to be removed. These are all front teeth, and all had been previously capped, and have broken off [ just like yours] I believe  my teeth probably shouln't have been capped as the dentist removes quite a bit to fit the crown,leaving the structure small and weak. Veneers might have been smarter. But I digress, The two I had post and crown are doing OK, but I have given up chewing anything hard. You are lucky you already had a root canal, because that is step #1. So, a post and crown is what comes next. This is still WAY cheaper than an implant, [ at least where I live] so for all the money I have spent on my mouth, I opt for  a cheaper option. I really didn't need antibiotics for the first two, but #3 requires it, and like you, have issues with taking them although I have \"sensitivities\" [ can't keep them down] Whereas your SJS is far more serious. As far as know, antibiotics are more commonly used in implants. I'm assuming you are young, in which case you may better weather an implant than my senior self,lol. Dental work is always a crap shoot in my long line of experience, a root canal can last 20+ years or fail in 1. If your root canal is still good, I think I'd try that first [ post and crown] Remember, once it's pulled, it's gone forever. Having to wear a partial plate in my mouth made me realize false teeth are a last resort. I couldn't talk properly or taste food. So I'm down to very little chew surface [ ditched the partial] while trying to preserve my front teeth. Good luck, thanks for the pics, makes me feel less alone, oh, and as a last thought, the rest of your teeth looks good, so be glad, maybe save that implant for later if the crown doesn't work.\n\nregards,\njoss\n\nP.S. KFLEX is one of the very few I [ antibiotics] I can take, but everyone is different. MattKW: Your deep bite makes replacement with a post and core riskier than most people, but still worth a go only because you have already had an RCT.\n You would need a cast post and core, not a prefab post.

I am actually booked in tomorrow morning to re-do the root canal. I was told that because the root has been exposed, when the tooth broke, it would be safer to re-do it before doing to crown. I thought this may be more than was needed but the root canal specialist agreed it would be safer to do it this way.\n\nI have no idea if it is a cast post and core that they have planned for me, but I know that he was saying that he will be making a ferrule from the broken tooth. In the notes it says \"A post crown is a special two part crown that has a gold core, which sits inside the tooth and provides mechanical support for the crown, which is cemented on top\" does this give any indication of if this is the right type of crown that Matt was talking of?\n\nI was strongly recommended this prosthodontist so hopefully he will be picking the best possible option :s pinkpotato: If anyone strongly disagrees with this plan then I may cancel my appointment tomorrow and wait to get a second opinion after Christmas. I was rushing to get it sorted because the tooth has already been broken for 3 weeks and I'm worried about it getting infected or decaying before I've had a chance to get it treated. It does have a temporary cover back over it at the moment though. pinkpotato: So from what I've been reading the amount of appointments gives a good indication of which approach the prosthodontist is wanting to take.\n\nThis is the treatment plan.\n2 hour appointment to re-do root canal\n2 hour appointment to prepare the tooth for post crown\n3/4 hour appointment to fit the post crown\n\nThen he suggests more appointments to make a night time bite shield.\n\nAnyone know which approach this would be taking - cast post and core or prefab post?\n\nSorry for the long string of messages, I'm stressing a bit because I'll be committing to this plan tomorrow. MattKW: If he's doing it in gold, then it's the preferred \"cast post and core\". Go for it. Escanor: Interesting why cast post and not a fiber post solution especially if we consider the aesthetic light transluscency in the anterior sector? MattKW: The cast post and core is one piece, rather than a fibre post with a composite core \"glued\" on to it. The aesthetics will not be affected and can easily be managed with opaquers. The bonding is likely to fail with a fibre post, and has been shown to offer no advantage in situations like the OP where the tooth is sheared off at gingival level. The cast post may cause more internal stresses on the tooth and lead to root fracture, but whichever way you look at it, this is a high risk case."

Extending the bridge doesn't make it better; it simply involves more teeth and more risk. Also makes it harder to align the drilling of the teeth so the cuts have to be deeper.

    "dialogue": "rosavictoriana: I am 73 yrs. old and have several rare, very challenging health issues. I hope to find leads on a new treatment for the osteonecrosis (dead jaw bone) and how I can restore some ability to have teeth & eat. I have lost half of my upper teeth & my dental professors have almost nothing to offer. I have a partial bridge for cosmetic reasons but cannot eat with them. If this bridge breaks I was told they could not make another as my mouth continues to shrink & it is very difficult to use the instruments.\n\nMy diet is very limited by poor ability to chew, extremely dry mouth, esophageal dysmotility and very limited liquid intake permitted because I have also developed Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (heart & lung disease) related to the Scleroderma. I am on oxygen 24/7.  Last month I lost 11 lbs without any intention. I became ill & needed nutritional intervention.  I am doing much better and ready to take action! I do not think the ONJ is presently active. I do not have pain, but I think it needs to be tested. \n\nI have had autoimmune diseases Sclerodeorma & Sjogrens (very dry mouth & eyes) for over 15 yrs. Several teeth fell out. About 3 yrs. ago I was hoping to get implants but when extracted it was noticed I had very little blood. I was soon diagnosed with Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) by biopsy by prof at U of CO School of Dental Medicine. My upper left jaw was scrapped & partially lost. The ONJ is related to taking bisphosphonates (bone strengthening RX) for several years and also having traumatic dental surgery.  Due to my Scleroderma, my mouth has shrunk quite small & I had traumatic dental surgery 2x under anesthesia. My doctors will not pull nor drill any cavities to avoid trauma and possible spread of the ONJ.  \n\nI use RX Prevident toothpaste, chlorhexidine gluconate w/out alcohol rinse, Nytastin for thrush, water pik & frequent cleanings.\nI found the best lozenge for dry mouth is OraCoat XyliMelts. They adhere to your mouth and are much better than Biotin. I sleep with XyliMelts under my pillow.  For my very dry eyes I have custom eye drops made from my own blood plasma.\n\nCan anyone recommend the most advanced research, doctors, institutions or organizations fighting any of these diseases?  Is stem cell therapy a viable option?  Any other possible treatments? I have good professor dentists, but they do not offer much hope.  I have not given up hope!  I will go anywhere . . .\n\nMany thanks for any leads! MattKW: Be wary of people offering stem cell solutions. There are a lot of quacks out there who will take the money of desperate people like you.

Unfortunately, we are living longer, and problems like yours are becoming more common."

    "title": "Porcelain or composite veneer to repair bridge?",
    "dialogue": "SharonBW: I have a 5 tooth bridge on the top front that is only 3 yrs old. It has had one of the Porcelain teeth just fall off. My regular dentist said the only option is to replace it but that is financially impossible as my insurance only covers once every 60 mo. He offered to put something on there temporarily (not sure what it was made out of) to see if I could get any more life out of it. It only lasted a week or two. In the meantime, he researched the problem and decided to do a porcelain veneer (his first one). Even though it was not covered by insurance and cost $1200, I consented because I was missing a front tooth! (It angers me that this type of \"cosmetic\" work isn't covered better by insurance since it's so traumatic and has a profound effect on people's lives.)\n\nTurns out, this expensive bit of work didn't stay on either. So, having moved to another state almost immediately after the \"repair\" I tried a new dentist. He said, \"oh I never would have done the Porcelain veneer and I'm not surprised it didn't stay on.\" He also told me he's seen better results with superglue. (I tried it - didn't work.) So, I went back and got a composite veneer (right word?) placed. It was much less expensive but now I'm terrified to eat anything. I'm chewing only on the back teeth on the opposite from the composite. I guess I can keep doing the indefinitely. \n\nWhat are my chances that this is going to last at least the 2 years til I can get another bridge?\nIs there anything else that can be done? \nDid the first dentist do shoddy work or does this happen a lot? \n\nThanks! \nSharon Busybee: I don't understand the terms of the dentist's practice but many dentists offer a five year guarantee for such work.   The dentist who did it should be replacing or repairing it for free or compensating you.   I reckon it's shoddy work by the technician if it falls apart as it has. MattKW: Legally, we can't give guarantees, although there is usually a fair bit of good will extended in certain situations. It sounds like the lab may have used an inferior porcelain or non-precious metal substructure. If you approach the dentist nicely, he might agree to remake the bridge and the lab might do their part for free too. Otherwise you'd have to raise a consumer complaint. Neither is much use if you've moved a long way away.\nYou can't put porcelain on porcelain (except in a furnace), and composite doesn't usually last long, but 2 years would be acceptable.

I was concerned that the problem might be the lab. It never occurred to me to ask the dentist to remake the bridge. He talked as if my only option was a new bridge. Once he decided he could try to repair it in my mouth (his first ever attempt) it involved bonding a porcelain veneer to metal as most of the existing porcelain was gone. The original didn't crack or break, it just came off the metal so most likely was poorly constructed. (Of note, the color matching was also poor - I wish I would've realized before he bonded it.)\n\nThe other question I had about the composite is whether it will stain easily. And, if it does, is it bleachable? My natural teeth are pretty stained as I'm a long time coffee drinker. Busybee: It used to stain but the modern composites don't tend to stain much at all.  It should look good for a couple of years.  \n\nI'm not sure of the law in your country but in the UK dental restorations are seen as \"goods\" and are covered by the Sale of Goods Act and if a dentist is unhelpful then redress can be claimed under that legislation.   In such cases it's down to what is considered reasonable and the restoration must be \"fit for purpose\" which would include it being able to do the job for a reasonable amount of time.   Private dental surgeries often offer guarantees as part of their contract with the patient and they will claim against their lab if something goes wrong. I'd assume the terms are in their lab contract.   In the US they must have some kind of similar redress for consumers of shoddy goods.  \n\nOne thing people often forget when they have any kind of treatment (not just dental) is to ask what happens if things go wrong.  I'd avoid any provider that is not happy with such a question.  Most dentists are accommodating, but it's best to ask next time you have a bridge done.   Have you checked whether your insurance policy covers faulty work?  It may be that there is a clause in there to pay for a replacement now."

    "dialogue": "misty1: Hello Everyone, \n I am having the worse time getting restorative care. Ok, I need a lot of work done. I suffer from dental phobia because of some bad experiences.  I recently said enough is enough and told myself I will do everything in my power to beat this. As soon as I developed this positive attitude towards my dental needs and health, I experienced more problems. A dentist pulled a tooth while I was screaming and crying for her to stop but she keeps going. I even went back to this office and asked for another dentist. My problem is trying to find a dentist who will want to save my front teeth before extracting my root tips. I Plan to get a few implants but need to get bonding or caps on the front. A few days ago one of my top front tooth broke. I have been to 2 different offices the past few months hoping to meet a nice, polite dentist who does not humiliate me. Almost like they want to give up on me. Today, I saw a new one because he was part of my insurance and Hoping to get a temporary crown, bridge or something so I can eat again and not cry. I even tell dentists that I  will pay cash or credit and forget about my insurance. I NEED SOMETHING NOW! This had made me so depressed and I am losing faith in dentists and myself. I am a beautiful girl but was abused for years and prescribed medication I thought I needed . In return , acid reflux , dry mouth and shame. So I left crying because they wanted me to come back in 2 weeks. I dont get it. Any advice. I live in Los Angeles,  I'm 44 and hope there are still dentists out there who do work the same day. I have missed so much because  Im ashamed. I used to be a confident. What suggestions could you give me so I can get work done immediately . I have had 3 sets of full x-rays in 6 months. Is it not possible anymore to get a dentist to do fillings, temporary crowns, bridges  or temporary partials? honestdoc: Please be patient.  Good work is not rushed.  I would ask friends, family, coworkers, etc for a good dentist.  Meet with that dentist and discuss all of your needs, expectations, phobias, difficulties, etc.  During that discussion, you will know if you feel comfortable with him or her and be given realistic expectations and treatment plan after a full examination.\n\nThere are a lot of factors that can impact your teeth.  Home care is very important.  If you don't take meticulous care of your teeth such as ineffective brushing, lack of flossing, and poor plaque control, you will continue to have deteriorating dental conditions.  If you continue to bathe your teeth with soda, Starbucks, energy drinks, acidic juices, etc, your teeth along with any dental work will fail.  If you lose motivation and continue with irregular dental visits, you will know the results.  Control any medical conditions such as diabetes, acid reflux, heart conditions, high blood pressure, etc as best as you can.  This is a lifetime commitment and anything less will not get the results you want."

    "dialogue": "examid: Hello,i had a patient a few days ago and made a class 3 preparation on her D3-3, next to it there was a cavitated lesion on 3-4 so i decided to access it mesialy(basically from the other preparation) and save the marginal ridge to make the treatment of this tooth minimally invasive. Everything went fine and a filling was placed,but when it was time to fill the 3-3 i only had 30 minutes left and my teacher told me that i can try to make that one too,i used total etch technique as per instruction,placed a bonding agent,light cured but later on because the space between the teeth was narrow and the gingival wall of 3-3 prep was quite low i had problems placing matrix and was in a rush so i decided to calmly put IRM and finish next time.\nNow the question is when i remove the IRM should i etch and apply bonding agent again? Maybe wasnt the smartest thing to do it in the first place but it happened. So can all of this affect the quality of restoration and should i repeat the steps when i will finally fill the cavity.\nThanks in advance for the answers. Busybee: I'm not a dentist but common sense would tell me that yes you would need to etch and apply bonding agent again if you have not completed the restoration.  Otherwise how will it work?  But I would love to see an opinion from one of our dentists.   My own opinion would be that you should not start treatment on a human subject if you are time constrained to finish.   They have to live with it in the meantime. MattKW: Freshen up the margins lightly, then re-etch and rebond. It's OK when things like this happen; the important thing is that you made sure the patient wasn't harmed or in pain until the next appointment. Your timing will get better as you gain more experience, but sometimes things go awry and you have to wind up in the best way possible. I generally try and start on the tooth likely to give me the most trouble (filling, extraction,...) in case I run over. The most memorable case was when I numbed up a patient for an immediate denture, then checked the denture to find the lab hadn't done it as per instructions! Luckily I hadn't started the extractions. S*** happens. examid: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFreshen up the margins lightly, then re-etch and rebond.

Because of this, it is important that you touch up the margins like Dr. MattKW mentioned and remove all the IRM.   If you have trouble placing the matrix, try pre-wedging the interproximal and allow it to expand.  I used to separate & protect the adjacent teeth with a matrix band during preparation but my mean instructor took it away from me.  \n\nI don't like to do class 3's on molars and premolars due to difficult access.  What school do you attend?  Hopefully they don't teach you \"extension for prevention,\" and isthmus preparation.  I would do a conservative class 2 box prep (if caries are minimal)."

    "title": "dental bridge and crowns always seem dry",
    "dialogue": "roxie9306: I got a dental bridge and crowns years ago, most of my front top teeth were done, so it's 6 teeth. I can't remember if I had this problem when I first got it done but I've noticed for at least a couple of years that the bridge and crowns always feel really dry. At first I thought it was dry mouth but that doesn't seem to fit. I drink a lot of water, and breathe through my nose. No matter what I do, I always feel that they are dry and sometimes I feel like they are sticking to my top lip, and it can make smiling and laughing difficult. I haven't found anyone else who has this problem so I hope I can find some help here. Busybee: If you have a dry mouth condition your tongue will feel dry too, it won't just be the front teeth.   It won't matter how much water you drink if there is a problem with the salivary glands.   Front teeth crowns can feel like they are sticking to the top lip and they can get dry from air.   I don't know how old you are but some of this could just be down to ageing or a change in elasticity of your lip.   Medication could have changed the conditions in your mouth.  Diet can affect the amount of saliva, e.g. high salt.    Drinking water on its own doesn't always hydrate the body adequately.  it's better to have milk or something with a suspension to retain the liquid in the body.   Perhaps over rigorous cleaning has roughened the porcelain.  It may be helped if the dentist polishes the crowns slightly. honestdoc: There are a few possibilities.  You could be taking medication(s) that could dry your mouth.  Another possibility is Sjogren's Syndrome (for females which you name suggests) and possible autoimmune response.  You may consider dry mouth products like Biotene. Busybee: These are whole mouth conditions honestdoc.  I had dry mouth from medication, it's unpleasant but doesn't affect your top lip.  I thought it might be sjogrens at the time but I didn't have dry eyes and thankfully it resolved.  \n\nBut if the restorations are old then dental wear and subsequent adjustments of the soft tissues of the face to changes in the architecture of the dentition could cause this discomfort.   If the crowns have become shorter then the lip will feel different.  It will feel weird smiling/ talking.  The change can be difficult to discern as it happens gradually.   Reductions in tooth height have many manifestations for functionality and feel of the lips.   It could be the back teeth have worn too.  It's an interesting area of dentistry that I don't think many dentists explore. MattKW: BusyBee, the patient doesn't always know it's whole mouth dryness. I see it often during routine examinations, and it's sometimes not unless I ask patients that they recognise the signs because it can be such a slow change. It is most commonly due to medications (Sjorgens is rare). \n\nAbout 80% of drugs have this side effect to varying degrees. Aging will also cause diminished mucin production so that although the total amount of saliva seems the same, the \" lubricability\" is decreased. There are simple salivary tests that can give quantitative assessments. \n\nCrowns don't wear or roughen because they're made of porcelain; no amount of scrubbing with toothpastes or toothbrushes will affect the porcelain in the way you suggest. \n\nLogically (and in reality), if the back teeth wear down, the the front teeth must wear down too in order to maintain an even occlusion. Sometimes the old feldspathic crowns on upper front teeth would wear down the opposing lower front teeth. If the mouth closes down (front and back), then the lips close more easily. Crowns don't wear down faster than teeth, if at all. \n\nOverclosure leads to an inverted smile, risk of angular cheilitis, and risk of TMD - all of which dentists have known about for a very, very long time. It used to be much more common when there were more dentures about and the resorption of the jaws or wear of the acrylic teeth resulted in rapid overclosure.\nAging will cause soft tissue changes in the lips: epidermal thinning, loss of collagen, which results in increased water loss and decreased elasticity of the skin. As dentists, we can't do anything about that, so there's nothing to \"explore\" from a dental perspective.\n\nI agree with honestdoc that medication-induced xerostomia would be first on my list of differential diagnoses for the sensation that OP describes, and generalised aging would be second, or act as a contributing factor. \"When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras.\" Busybee: Porcelain crowns most certainly do wear, it depends on the material & the bite.    They are supposed to wear equally to teeth but sometimes what I have heard described as \"functionality vs aesthetics\" is balanced towards aesthetics in the dentist's psyche. honestdoc: Porcelain (ceramic) will wear over time but is harder than enamel and will wear against opposing teeth.  Despite being harder (higher compressive strength) than enamel, porcelain will also fracture (lower tensile strength).  The functionality of porcelain is not as good as gold or metal.  Enamel will wear against gold and metals and you never heard of gold or metals fracturing.  Guess which is more esthetic (sorry, American English?). Busybee: Doesn't it all depend on how polished the restorations are?  I've always needed adjustments to porcelain and I do think that's what makes them more prone to wear.   Surely adjustments create greater surface area which is more prone to friction? Busybee: By the way I had the line about there being a trade off between functionality  and aesthetics from a \"smile design\" dentist that was the root cause of all my semi-recent problems.   She managed to cement a front incisor crown so crookedly that I could not close my mouth.  She then insisted on adjusting one of my natural premolars after about 45 mins of trying to adjust her precious crown.  This was her line after that.     I can't believe dentists like her are allowed to practise.    I needed her crowns replacing as my bite was a mess. MattKW: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoesn't it all depend on how polished the restorations are?  I've always needed adjustments to porcelain and I do think that's what makes them more prone to wear.

The roughness of the ceramic and subsequent exposure of the crystalline structure will cause more wear of the opposing teeth. So, softer ceramics will wear fractionally more than harder ceramics and lose their smoothness, and this can lead to more wear of the natural teeth.. If the crown is adjusted and not repolished well, this also will increase the wear of the opposing tooth. Sometimes it's better to adjust the opposing tooth rather than the crown; sometimes the crown should be sent back to the lab for reglazing; sometimes it's best to admit defeat and have the crown remade. honestdoc: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHardness of the ceramic does not determine the wear against opposing teeth.

In your case, I also remembered different particle sizes in a matrix play a role where the larger particles (rougher surface) can cause more wear or resist wear as in composites.  However, the larger particles are more difficult to polish smooth."

    "dialogue": "Jojobirdy13: Hi\n\nI require a inlay and onlay on my 1st lower right molar (I only have 1 pre molar due to extractions for braces in my teens).\n\nThis will be a big restoration as the tooth is big and my dentist recommends emax stating this material now lasts the same as gold but from what I have read I think gold is best. \n\n\nPros emax- aesthetic, claims to be strong and cheaper option than gold.\n\n\nCons emax- has longevity been proven? Is the material kind to tissue and opposing enamel? Is there risk of material letting further decay slip in? \n\n\nGold pros: proven longevity, kind to tissue and enamel and conservative restoration\n\n\nGold cons: wont show when I smile as I have a overbite but my onlay will sometimes be on show when I talk or open mouth (I do currently have amalgam filling but the onlay in gold will this be more noticeable?), cost is a bit more expensive but if lasts long term is this better option? \n\n\nMy question is, which would you have in your mouth on your 1st pre molar? honestdoc: Thanks for asking these are great questions.  It shows how much you appreciate the work.  I would personally put gold in most of my teeth but I'm old school and I'm not as aesthetically conscious as most.  The reason I like gold is that 1) you don't have to drill as much because thin gold won't fracture, 2) gold has the most accurate margins where gold meets the tooth with minimal micro-gaps where bacteria and contaminants could leak through, and 3) gold is softer and friendlier to opposing teeth in which it won't wear against unlike ceramics which could many times damage the opposing teeth.\n\nMany dentists are now \"metal\" free or environmental, naturopathic, cosmetic, etc.  When dentist claim they are \"metal\" free, it is misleading because restorations have barium sulfate additives to show up in x-rays or otherwise it will look like a black hole.  Your dentist could argue against me because many don't do gold anymore.  Gold is actually cheaper because it is less labor intensive than ceramics and prices reflect it on my dental lab scripts. Jojobirdy13: Thank you so much for your reply. This helps out a lot and I really appreciate your knowledge and experience.\n\nWhilst aesthetics are a bonus I’m trying to look at what would be the best option  for my molar and opposing enamel.\n\nSo for the inlay and a onlay that i require,the cost is £475 for emax but £600 for gold. Does this sound about right? I do think that my dentist did not expect my request for gold when white restorations are the most popular.\n\nHe has advised white would be better as partially on show. My other option is mixed alloy but all research tends to point that gold is the best.\n\nWith a gold resprtation am I looking for a particular percetange or carat of gold within the material?\n\nIf I was to opt for a gold now would I need to stick to gold if I required a restoration on the opposing or adjacent teeth? Just in case I require further work in the future as gold resortations are harder to come by.\n\nThanks again honestdoc: There are 3 types of cast alloys.  First is high noble which is the most expensive and the highest gold content of over 40% (Over 60% noble metals of gold, palladium and/or platinum).  This is the softest most friendly for inlays and onlays.  Second, is noble which has over 25% noble metals.  This is base metal which is under 25%. \n\nIn the US, ceramic is more expensive because it is more labor intensive.  You can request Noble alloy which is over 25% noble content (less expensive than high noble).  Anything under is too hard alloy for inlays.\n\nFor future work, it is difficult to answer.  Obviously ceramic will wear down opposing teeth and gold.  You might consider bite guard to minimize wear. Busybee: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThanks for asking these are great questions.

It was the only onlay I had for many years and was incredibly strong.  I had no problems with the tooth but over the years a gap opened up at the margin.  Dentists didn't want to touch it, one cleaned it out and filled the gap, but that crumbled and I've finally had it redone in zircon.  The tooth was full of decay inside.  I was shocked because I am meticulous with my hygiene.  But of course there's no way I could have kept it clean as you cannot get underneath a gap like that.   It's amazing that I had barely no symptoms and no actual pain at all.\n\nSo my impression is that that only happens with a metal onlay.  Can it warp?   I have another gold one and it has been great at fixing a cracked molar.  Again really strong, just like a very healthy natural tooth.   So I hope that the same thing doesn't happen.   Ceramic just doesn't feel as strong, in the sense that it has less give.  \n\nI was reading today about the elasticity of different dental materials vs the dentine and I guess that's probably why they feel so different.   The science behind it is very interesting, choosing dental materials must be just like deciding what to use for major engineering projects! honestdoc: Choosing dental materials for me involves various thought processes.  I have consideration of the materials spectrum of esthetics vs functionality.  Highly esthetic materials may have deficient functionality/longevity properties and vice versa.  Modern materials have improved.  One of my favorite material is Glass Ionomers due to their natural dentinal bonding and desensitizing.  Their past drawback is their lack of strength.  Fortunately modern GIs such as Fuji Equia are approved for posterior final restorations.  There is a new class of materials that are bioactive.  Previously the body tolerates bio-compatible materials.  With bioactive, the body thrives with them.  Cementum has been shown to grown on Activa restorative materials.  I favor the most conservative options and consider pros & cons of different appropriate materials."

    "title": "Good Single Fake Molars",
    "dialogue": "jc1199: Does anyone know of a source for good quality single fake molars? I'm looking for something that is like a kit type of thing where I would be able to get a few single fitted fake molars.\n\nWhat I really need is are few implants but I'm am in the working poor category and I can't possibly afford to go anywhere near a dentist. So I'm looking for an alternative that will work that I can afford. honestdoc: I don't recommend any kits or DIY dental systems.  They can be a choking hazard, damage your bite & TMJ, gums, bone, etc.  If costs are prohibitive, try a teaching facility like dental schools or community dental clinics. jc1199: Unfortunately community clinics around here pretty much just do extractions. We have one here that is a free clinic but things like actually having teeth to eat with are considered \"cosmetic\" and \"non-essential\". They only do essential stuff like pulling your teeth out.\n\nI've looked into the nearby college (MUSC in downtown Charleston) but they would charge a serious amount of money for implants. Far beyond my capacity to pay.\n\nI understand why an actual dentist would never recommend DIY kits. But, so far that has been the only option I have found that I can actually get.\n\nWhat I need is something I can afford like this Temptooth Unfortunately they state that it is entirely cosmetic and won't work as a molar. What do you think of one of these? \nMolar option 1 \nMolar option 2 \n\nIf I had the ability to go to a dentist I'd go asap. But that's just not an option for me financially. When I look at prices for dental care I get very depressed. It makes me feel like I'm browsing around a private jet dealership. MattKW: jc1199 said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUnfortunately community clinics around here pretty much just do extractions....\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nNo, those options you link to are for temporary crowns to fit over OVER a tooth that has been drilled back for a crown. They are only for dentists, and have no use for laypeople at all. The simplest way for fake teeth are plastic (acrylic) dentures. Why not investigate that option at a community dental clinic? Community dental clinics will never do implants. jc1199: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNo, those options you link to are for temporary crowns to fit over OVER a tooth that has been drilled back for a crown.

What area do you reside?  What teeth are you missing.  Could you provide images of the missing areas as well as the opposing?  Implants will never be financially friendly, even in developing countries.  Like Dr. MattKw mentioned, you can look into partial dentures.  They will feel awkward at first but they are more economic than implants.  I would stay away from bridges if possible since they involve drilling on good teeth. jc1199: I'm missing two upper middle molars (left/right) and one lower rear molar (right). The placement is just right to make it as difficult as possible to chew anything solid. I have 3 other molars that I know will be a problem in the future. Being poor is extremely expensive, I don't recommend it to anyone, ever. There has to be some way I can replace them without being a Walton heir or a drug kingpin.\n\nI reside in the Charleston, SC area. If I had the money to escape, I would in a blink of an eye. It's a place that has a very high cost of living and extremely low wages. honestdoc: I looked it up.  Your city has a dental school.  Hopefully you can get all your teeth checked and get a thorough treatment plan.  What is your occupation?  Hopefully you can establish a solid career path.  Working for any gov't entity provides good dental insurance.  Unfortunately there is no such thing as a DIY dental restoration.  Remember, you can develop TMJ, gum, bone, teeth, oral mucosal damage if attempt unsupervised.  Look up mouth damage. jc1199: I know about MUSC. I looked into them early on. They charge $275 to walk in the door of the dental school. Price tags rapidly increase from there. In general MUSC is savagely expensive for anything. If you so much as walk in there and say hello you'll walk out with a bill for $10,000. I had a seizure several months ago and ended up unconscious in a parking lot. I was ultimately taken to MUSC. I basically laid in a bed there for 3 days. No surgery or anything like that. They sent me a bill for $50,000. I laughed. They may as well have sent a bill for 800 billion. \n\nI've worked in two different fields. At times as a tech in electronics at the industrial and manufacturing level, mostly in designing and building communication systems like broadband networks and satellite communication systems. And there were times that I worked in media production designing graphics, animation, 3D models, building sets and props, video/audio production, and web design. \n\nAt the moment I work for a small business as a tech consultant for solar power installations and energy monitoring systems. Low pay and no benefits. I make it a goal to apply for a job every day. I monitor job posts daily. There just isn't a whole lot going on right now. Well, there are tons of job postings but most pay even less than I make now. If I could get a government job I would take it asap. I've actually applied for one recently.\n\nI looked into dental insurance and it seems to be mostly a scam. You pay for insurance that doesn't really cover any actual dental care.\n\nI know there are risk in the DIY route, but as far as I can tell it's either that or nothing. honestdoc: I'm sorry I don't know of any solutions.  I just know that teaching facilities can be a less expensive but good option for dental care.  Not sure if you can apply for state assistance. jc1199: SC is a blood red state. The primary function of the state government is to transfer as much money as possible from the people who work for a living into the pockets of the rich. If you aren't wealthy all you'll get from the state is a giant FU. If you're really lucky they won't decide to take a massive dump in your mouth.\n\nI find it baffling that there is no reasonable solution for a missing molar. Obviously I'm not the first low income person with this problem and I'm sure this is something that plagues lower income people more than anyone. How can there not be an affordable fix for this?\n\nWhat is the most common way a dentist would replace a missing molar? honestdoc: It is difficult to justify \"most common.\"  Most of my patients are poor and they just leave the missing area.  Sometimes when the middle molar is missing, over time, the posterior molar tips forward and bites into the opposing molar.  The second option is a partial denture.  It is more conservative with minimal teeth drilling.  The disadvantage is it is removable and awkward feeling.  If you are missing more than 1 teeth in an arch, it may be more economical.  The 3rd option is a bridge.  I don't like bridges because you have to shave both abutment teeth down resulting in more sensitive and weaker teeth.  I've seen bridges fail too many times and you lose additional abutment teeth.  Some dentists place bonded \"Maryland\" bridges in that the pontic is bonded to abutment teeth.  The result usually is failed bonding and it becomes a choking hazard.  Bridges are very expensive as well costing close to $3,000 (3 unit bridge).  Then you get into the implants.\n\nYou seem to not accept the options.  The only way for you to realize is to try DIY despite my recommendations against.  Soon, you will understand.  I'm not trying to rip you off or get greedy on you.  The reason dentistry is expensive is that it is very labor intensive and there is only one market for dental supply and equipment companies to sell their marked up products.  For most dental clinics in the US, dentist only takes home about 10 to 20 cents on the dollar after staff, insurance, and overhead.  That is why my wife won't let me own one. jc1199: Grinding/drilling down my good teeth will never, ever be an option... period done, over. I guard my good teeth like gold plated platinum bricks. Under no circumstances will I allow any damage to my current functional teeth for any reason ever - no matter what. \n\nEverything you mentioned is extremely bad. I feel like rolling the dice and fixing this myself is by far the best way to go. \n\nThere is a reason I seem not to accept the options. We are trapped in a system that runs on money. I don't have money. Therefore I am totally effed in the A.\n\nI'm looking for an option that is closer to $40 than $3000. An Option that I can actually get. There has to be one. It's too much of an necessity not to be. Who in the hell doesn't need teeth to chew food?\n\nIf this is true. If there is no practical solution to replacing a molar. Then I will create it -- do or die. Because I really need it, and I know there are millions of others who really need it. honestdoc: You have a good entrepreneurial spirit.  I'm sorry I have no advice suitable for you."

Because if it's the latter you're likely to get used to that over time.  The dentist could polish it a bit to make it feel more acceptable.  A crown is a foreign object that's plonked in your mouth.  Sometimes it feels very alien and can get about two to three months to get used to.

Busybee: Funnily enough I don't think there's one ceramic restoration that I have not had adjusted by the dentist to ensure the bite is good.

I probably get ~80% that need no adjustment. Once in a while it comes back way out of whack, but that's usually because the patient has a bite that's difficult to record.\nIf you try to adjust a tooth before cementation, then the remaining thickness can be measured with calipers. After it's been cemented, nobody knows how thick it is, and you can drill through without warning. It makes no difference if it looks like a tank, I wouldn't touch it.\nDrilling of ceramic crowns can also lead to microfractures, which although may not cause the crown to break on the day of adjustment, it can be a cause of later fracture even years later. Reglazing is best practice for anything more than minor adjustments. It is often safer to make minor adjustment to the opposing natural teeth.

Rather than create further uncertainty, why not let the matter settle? Busybee: That's what I've done.   But there is definitely more official governance required on what is deemed to be a satisfactory restoration.  Comparing it to worst case doesn't make it aesthetically acceptable.   I'm not sure whether there even are any guidelines or rules for ensuring a restoration fits with the rest of the teeth and feels normal to the patient.   If you check this forum there are many such posts.  It cannot be that so many people are simply unduly concerned.   There are problems in variation and quality of restorations and it seems that patients have no control and little recourse when so much seems subjective. MattKW: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThat's what I've done. ..\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nThese fora attract certain people that perhaps don't have that good relationship with their dentist, so it skews the representation of what's really happening. A better guide would come from statistics gathered from the Dental Boards and dental Associations, and insurers; these are often published.\nThere is no way of quantifying aesthetics, apart from comparing the work done to that of our peers. For example, I would expect the quality to be acceptable at a lower level in a 3rd world country. I would expect that a specialist prosthodontist will be judged against that of other prosthodontists, not against general dentists. honestdoc: In the US, work done by general dentists are judged equally against those by specialists such as prosthodontics, endodontics, surgery, etc.  Unfortunately, it seems that patients take advantage of dentists with the over-abundance of attorneys in this country.  An unrelated legal case involved a dentist and a non-compliant periodontal patient.  Pt missed a lot of appointments and treatments and later sued the dentist for lost teeth.  Complete documentation were provided including perio charting, thorough chart notes, and treatment plans.  However, the jury found in favor of the patient because the dentist \"did not adequately prove to the patient of his deteriorating periodontal condition.\"  \n\nI don't like to work on cosmetic cases very often.  It is very frustrating when patients get dissatisfied after your best attempt through mock ups, lab work, fittings, etc.  I've encountered numerous dissatisfied denture cases after a lot of hard work.  Luckily I usually ask the proper questions before I take cases on and will refer or not treat as appropriate.

If you have a tooth that has been prepared with minimal taper, i.e. near-parallel walls, then putting on a well-fitting permanent crown using temp cement can make them really hard to get off. Plus, there's the risk of damaging the permanent crown when you try to dislodge it. But if it went OK for you, then that's fine. Busybee: It really is down to the skill of the dentist.  Some dentists are good at letting you try in crowns others find it hard to mix the cement to the right consistency without making it rock solid.  I am not sure why but it's very much a personal thing as to how dentists deal with their temps or try ins.   I think it's a good idea to try crowns in over night.  It won't give you the exact feel of the final result  because perm cement is more robust and but will give you a good idea compared with not trying it in.   If the crown is well made it won't need much temp cement to stay on overnight. MattKW: It's hard to mix the cement to the \"right\" consistency. usually this mean adding some Vaseline to \" weaken\" the bonding. I don't understand why you think it is a good thing to try in crowns overnight. Apart from the bridge I mentioned earlier (the colour was questionable), I have never let a patient \"try-in\" a crown or bridge overnight. It's fraught with the danger of not being able to remove the crown at a later appointment without damage. Only once in 36  years of practice have I had to remove a crown after permanently cementing it. If you have a good lab, and do good treatment, and don't cement in iffy crowns, then why the need to temporarily cement crowns? A crown that is \" well made\" doesn't need temporary cementation. Busybee: I'm guessing aesthetic cosmetics aren't your thing MattKW.  It's very important to some people when having aesthetic work on the front teeth.   \n\nIt's fine to just cement anything in if a patient doesn't care a jot for the way the teeth will look or feel.   I'm sure loads of people aren't that bothered,  But a lot of good cosmetic dentists used to do this to avoid having to drill off if there was a problem later.  These days a lot of cosmetic practices go for creating high spec temporaries that are meant to replicate the final result.  But it's not the same thing.    It's ok for veneers but with crowns it's better to try in the real thing.\n\nI'm sure you've seen people posting here who are unhappy with the shape or length of just one crowned tooth or maybe feel that the teeth stick out too much.  This helps avoid such situations.   Because the last thing you want to do is replace one tooth when you have porcelain to match on each side.  \n\n It seems very easy for some dentists and a bit palaver for those dentists I deem to make a meal of every piece of work.  There are different styles of working and some dentists can achieve a great outcome by just doing things simply and quickly.   Those are dentists that I really rate.    Those dentists will let you try in overnight and know how to get the temp cement just right and have great technicians that they communicate well with.   They also tend to know exactly what to do with the minimum fuss.  They also don't tend to make mistakes.   Confident and capable  dentists do all this. MattKW: The topic here was a zirc crown, and that's likely to be posterior, so aesthetics don't come into it. I rarely have aesthetic issues with anterior crowns due to digital photography and a good lab. Patients with challenging requirements are best asked to go to the lab in person. Another issue is if the patient takes home a real crown that is temporarily glued in, and it falls out and is damaged or lost, who pays the bill? Much safer and sensible to have the patient with family attend a fitting session at my surgery. I can only be confident and capable when the treatment is under my control. Busybee: \"Control\" is the key word here.  The dentist in question in the OP has given the patient some control over the outcome.    An important part of change management is allowing stakeholders to feel that they have some control over changes.  That facilitates acceptance.  Having major dental reconstruction can be life changing (in a good or bad way).   In this case it's just one tooth, it may be a back tooth, but the dentist in the OP must have found that trying in works in the past with patients who express concerns on try-in in the chair.  The patient appears sensitive to changes and anxious about getting things right.  So while most don't need this safety net, some patients do.  This is the dentist putting the patient in the driving seat.  \n\nYes there are risks, but there are risks of costs either way.  \n\nThe OP's question was whether the crown is going to be perfect after trying in.  Most dentists are pretty good at clearing out temp cement from a restoration chair-side.  After all they have to clean it pretty well from the prepared tooth. \n\nIt's great to send patients to the lab by the way."

    "dialogue": "Nan: I underwent root canal treatment in my upper molar (tooth 26), and had my tooth prepped to fit a crown.\nI am looking into eMax (lithium disilicate) vs solid Zirconia for a crown.\nIs it true that it is difficult to adjust a Zirconia crown after cementation (chairside) as opposed to eMax?\nI am worried that if I choose a Zirconia crown and it will need an adjustment, the dentist might end up adjusting the healthy opposing tooth instead – (because of the difficulty in adjusting the Zirconia) and I would not be happy with that.\nI should mention that my dentist took conventional (pvs) impressions of my my teeth, not digital.\nWould eMax be preferred in terms of durability/wear/chairside adjustment? What would be my best bet between the two materials?\n\nAttached is an X-ray of my molar (tooth 26) after root canal treatment with temporary filling, before crown prep.\nI would greatly appreciate all insights and recommendations. honestdoc: I recommend Zirconia crown for the molar.  eMax has a tendency to fracture at that location.  I have no problems adjusting Zirconina crowns and your dentist should not have to drill on opposing teeth.  eMax would look beautiful on the front teeth although I see fractured anterior crowns very often as well.  In restorative dentistry decision making, one must consider esthetics on one end of the spectrum and functionality on the other.  It would be nice to have both but not as often as we like. MattKW: I'd firstly prefer a stainless steel post for reinforcement of the core. I don't see much benefit of zirconia apart from near indestructibility. I prefer monolithic eMax (not layered) that will do just nicely and bonds better than zirconia. Conventional VPSis fine; digital is just the latest and greatest, but no significant difference. A good impression can be achieved by many different materials and techniques. My favourite used to be polyether (Impregum) for hydrophilicity, but not too tasty, and more expensive than VPS.

My dentist did a glass ionomer buildup without post/pin/screw, due to adequate remaining tooth structure. Would you still recommend an eMax crown considering the core buildup in my case? \nWould you be able to specify the disadvantages/problems you have experienced with Zirconia crowns?\nTo note: I'm not a grinder or a clencher, but due to the fact that molar tooth #26 is in charge of most of the heavy chewing, I want to be able to chew comfortably without worrying about breaking my crown. honestdoc: Of course different dentists will have different opinions.  I respect Dr. MattKW's over 30 yrs experience.  I'm the most experienced dentist at my location and by default, I see the most complicated cases, conduct peer reviews and take on ~5-8 walk-in emergencies each work day along with my full schedule.  Bottom line, I see a lot a good work fail and a lot of marginal work still functioning. \n\nI like Zirconia because I don't have to drill as much (drilling more achieves thicker stronger crowns).  I cement Zirconia with Glass Iononmer because it bonds naturally to dentin and has desensitizing properties (desensitizing is not a priority after RCT).   \n\neMax and resin cement will work.  For resin cement, there are close to 10 generations of bonding systems with their own advantages & disadvantages.  Unfortunately I see too many failed bonded resin cements.  For eMax, the dentist has to drill more because it is not as strong as Zirconia.  Modern zirconia crowns have better esthetics and I use many of them on anteriors.  I've adjusted hundreds of zirconia crowns and drilled many RCT access holes and it is harder than eMax but I have no problems.  The dentist will have to use diamond burs of various grits for more predictable results.\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages of placing posts.  The biggest problem of placing posts is weakening the roots especially molars with their smaller roots.  US military dentistry research has shown at least~4 mm pulp chamber retention to be ideal.\n\nIn my opinion, VPS is still the most reliable and predictable impression material.  Modern VPS has additives to make it more hydrophilic and accurate.  Digital impression still lags behind in accuracy although to a non-dental professional like most patients, it looks amazing and futuristic.  I leave the VPS impression 2 minutes longer than recommended to minimize tray separation stress distortion when the material is fully & predictably set.

Does that make sense?\n\nAlso, in terms of cytotoxicity and long term biocompatibility - would one material be preferred over the other? Can Zirconia be harmful in any way? Can Emax be toxic? honestdoc: You have very good questions!  Since eMax is not as strong as Zirconia, eMax needs more drilling to accommodate a thicker crown.  I'm sure modern eMax has improved in strength though.\n\nI don't know the exact details of cytotoxicity and long term biocompatibility of either materials.  When a material has been approved for dental applications, we believe it has been thoroughly tested.\n\nDr. MattKW may have some valuable insights.  That is the beauty of peer discussions. MattKW: Neither has biocompatibility problems. I simply prefer eMax as a all-round use material as it can be resin-bonded to preparations whereas zirconia can't be truly bonded without special preparations. In most cases where the retention is good, then even bonding is of secondary importance. Monolithic eMax (or zirconia) is stronger than layered eMax (or zirconia). There's really not that much difference between either for a back tooth. As for post and pins, the pins don't add much, but I have seen failures with simple cores that haven't been reinforced with at least one post. The biggest problems with posts is if they're too thick or long, then their usefulness diminishes, and the risks increase (been there, done that). I like to use one medium length post in largest canal, and a shorter and thinner post in a secondary canal. honestdoc: Dr. MattKW is correct on all counts.  Glass Iononmer cements do not bond to Zirconia crowns.  I prep for Zirconia like I prep for Full Gold with mechanical retention.  In dentistry, we tend to remember the failures and forget the successes.  I see a lot of eMax with resin bonded cements still in function (otherwise they would be taken off the market).  I just don't trust bonding as much as mechanical retention due to a lot variables involved.  Many patients think bonding without a lot of real world science.  Bottom line, (I know it is a different scenario) when dentists evaluate posterior composites on x-ray, we tend to see \"black\" lines around them.  What are those black lines?  Is it micro gaps?  Is it pooling of excess bond?  Is it recurrent or start of recurrent caries?  Since many of the composites are done by the same provider evaluating it, we tend to think pooling.  As in my previous post, I mentioned there are close to 10 generations of bonding systems with varying strengths and weaknesses.  Ironically I attended 2 lectures (many years ago before the 8th generation was developed) given by John Kanca DMD who is regarded as the father of adhesive dentistry and who the bonding system products go through for review.  \n\nDr. MattKw is also correct on layering.  I can't think of any reason to do that other than for esthetics which goes back to my earlier post mentioning esthetics vs function.

Glass ionomer bonds naturally to dentin (tooth) but not to zirconia.  It is cemented mechanically similar to full gold crown is retained.  Resin Modified Glass Ionomer is actually what I'm talking about.  It is the modern GI that is reinforced for strength.  Almost all modern GI products are actually RMGI and the non RM are being phased out.\n\nGordon Christensen has a lot of information and has his own testing and teaching facility.  Unfortunately he has a lot of financial interests in many products so I usually do my homework further.

The layering will weaken the restoration with the high likelyhood the porcelain may fracture off. MattKW: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSee if the technician can fabricate monlithic.

He did prep it sub-gingival.\nIt was the technician who preferred zirc covered in porcelain, because he says he can easily \"remove and add\" material as opposed to monolithic - where he can only remove, not add back on. (I guess he's speaking about adjustment?)\nIs that a good enough reason not to get monolithic? Or is it just the easy way out for a technician? honestdoc: It's a tough call.  Many times dental labs aren't equipped or technicians aren't trained for certain work.  Maybe your dentist can send it to another lab for monolithic material of yours or your dentist's choice.

He too recommends the layered Zirconia. He says it will be much more aesthetic and it won't be of lesser strength or fracture. He says the monolithic is going out of fashion.\nBut I am so confused, because that contradicts all that I read about monolithic and layered Zirc. I thought porcelain layered Zirc was conventional and problematic and that the monolithic was the newer solution in terms of fracture resistance.\nIt sounds like he is more comfortable using the layered, he says it should not fracture if it is made correctly, but I am still concerned that it may be the wrong choice after hearing multiple other dentists recommending monolithic for posterior teeth - as you have as well.\nI don't  normally grind or clench my teeth, and I don't suffer from bruxism, but I did have a deep cavity in that molar (upper first maxillary) that ended up with the root canal treatment - and I'm just so unclear about what to do now.\nWhat is your opinion & suggestion?"

    "dialogue": "Artmonkey: I had an NHS filling two days ago that gave me concerns regarding the manner it was executed. The proceedure was to a lower molar which is fairly loose due to gum disease and the decay was on the gum line. The filling was done without the removal of any of the existing decay, by merely cleaning out the cavity and then filling straight away with a paste. No anaesthetic was used and the whole procedure took around 5 minutes. I am still in pain nearly 48 hours later.\nIs it accepted practise to fill a cavity without removing the decay. I am puzzled, please advise. MattKW: It depends. If the tooth is doomed from perio problems, then a simple filling might be useful as a short term measure. Really, treatment depends on why you are having pain, and then determining the best way to treat it. In your case, the main aim is to relieve pain and if this was not achievable, then it should've been explained to you, and you should've been given options. Sometimes I'll do a simple filling without anaesthetic if the tooth is going to be lost anyway, or if the full treatment is too costly for the patient - they have to understand why, and agree.

An example might be a front tooth and the patient wants to hold onto the dodgy tooth until they can get an immediate denture arranged.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nThanks, that does help clarify the situation. As I said, the tooth is loose and so I assume doomed. My main concern is that the decay remains present under the filling and I imagine will continue to cause pain? MattKW: Decay in of itself won't cause pain. It's mostly a case of preventing fluids from getting down deep. If the bacteria are starved of nutrients, then decay can be halted, and it is a recognised technique where the bulk of decay is removed, the tooth sealed well, then reopened months later when the tooth has had chance of repair. I think it more likely your pain comes from the loosening of the tooth (gum disease) allowing exposure of root surfaces than the decay itself. Just an educated guess without benefit of Xrays etc. Artmonkey: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDecay in of itself won't cause pain. It's mostly a case of preventing fluids from getting down deep.

    "title": "My dental bridge hurts...",
    "dialogue": "thelilyfield: I went to the dentist in April after a 12 year hiatus.  =(  We were poor and didn't have insurance.  Anyhow, no cavities, but the dentist asked about my missing crown.  It had been missing for 12 years and never bothered me so I never went in to have it fixed.  He told me I would need a bridge or an implant.  I asked if it was absolutely necessary because I was never bothered by the missing tooth.  He said yes, so I went ahead with a bridge.  I've since been in 3 times with pain and a poor fit.  My dentist insists it's glued in there and not coming out without breaking the teeth underneath it.  But I can't handle this pain day in and day out.  It's literally making me depressed to have gone from NO pain despite missing tooth, to now not being able to chew on that side of my mouth at all anymore.  I can't even bite into certain foods (strawberries for instance) with my front teeth because it hurts the back teeth holding my bridge.  Tart foods also make it hurt even when it's not touching.  I am so frustrated.  I paid $5k after insurance for this.  What can I do??  I want to seek out a second opinion, but that's just more money.  Can I ask for a refund for what I paid?  It's only caused damage, not helped me at all.  I'm only 34 - I don't want to deal with this every day for the rest of my life. honestdoc: The dentist was probably production hungry and over-treated you.  I see this problem all too often.  First, you were fine with the missing teeth with no problems functioning.  Secondly, you were missing the tooth for 12 years.  From my observations, most of the teeth shifting had already occurred.  Thirdly, the dentist did not properly inform you of the risks of teeth drilling nor respect your decision of no treatment.  \n\nGo back to the dentist and discuss your problems.  If the dentist did not adequately address your problem, you may have to report him/her to the licensing authorities.  By the way, if your abutment teeth need root canal treatment(s), the teeth will be a lot weaker therefore compromising the strength of the bridge.  Unfortunately I see failed bridges way too often.  I don't know what country or area you are in, but there may be grounds for legal action. thelilyfield: Thank you for that response.  I am in Southern California.  It struck me as odd because it was my first time in the office - we finally got insurance and booked my first appointment for a check-up - and I walked out with a temporary bridge 2 hours later and I didn't even know what a bridge was when I walked in that morning.  Obviously I don't feel confident in dental health, so I went with what he insisted was my best plan.  He told me I had zero cavities, so obviously the teeth he drilled down were fine before the bridge was put in place.  I am so depressed that I can't even just have the bridge removed because the teeth underneath are destroyed from the drilling."

My new dentist says that I need a post and core for it before getting a crown.\n\nMy question is that I got a RCT and crown on #20 earlier this year with another dentist (see second image), and that other dentist said that a post and core wasn't necessary and placed a crown on top.\n\nWhat do you think is the best option for my recently operated tooth?

    "title": "Seeking advice RCT Crown Infection/ Canker HELP",
    "dialogue": "emmadudlyke: Hi there, \n\nI've attached the X_Ray looking for the source of my infection around my crown.\n\nI received a root canal treatment when I was 19 years old (now 26 years old) and had a metal/ porcelain crown fitted. Everything was working fine, until one Halloween I ate a Black Jack which pulled off the crown straight off a few years back - which I then had re-fitted back by another dentist. Since then I've always felt like it had been slightly not fitted correctly, but I didn't mention anything. \n\nAbout a year ago my RCT Dentist suggested I get a new Crown (even though they did tell me mine I would only need to change after 10-15 years). For quite a few months now I've been experiencing bad smells whenever I have flossed around my crown (no where else) and 4 months ago a small BUBBLE appeared  on my gum next to it and so I pressed it - and this bad smelling liquid oozed out (must be an infection) Now I know every time I floss, the bubble fills up as if I irritate that area, and so I went to my dentist and he took an X-Ray. He said usually it is possible with RCT that they don't clean out all of the decay from the initial treatment and this causes infection, or there is a crack in the root that allows bacteria to grow. The X-Ray showed no cracks on my root and so he gave me an option of drilling through my perfectly fine crown to observe and inconsistencies, OR I pay £100 for a 3D-scan ( but he stressed this option may not confirm the crack or the infection origin). My gut instinct from the beginning was to take anti-biotics or just replace the whole crown and clean up the surface and now after the first procedure - he has confirmed that there was no crack or anything wrong, but has left me now with half-a crown that wasn't entirely cleaned and is filled up with a temporary filling which in my option will leave this area more vulnerable. Instead of finishing of the inspection in one session, I have to go again and finish off what he started - and now replace my entire crown anyway. \n\nAfter the first treatment, my BUBBLE filled up again and with blood this time and there is still a very bad taste of infection or decay from underneath the crown. \n\nHas any had this experience? I'm not sure what to do because now I'm paying out of my nose for treatments that didn't need to be invasive in the first place. \n\nAny advise would be much appreciated :0 Thankyou honestdoc: On the x-ray, it looks like you have cavities or damage on both sides of the crown.  With the indicator going down mid root, it looks like a possible vertical root fracture.  You cannot see incomplete fractures on x-rays unless the 2 segments are separated.  Ask the dentist to perio probe around the area.  A positive sign is normal probings until it hits that damaged spot with the probe showing deep readings of narrow width.  Consider and prepare for tooth extraction and possible implant in the future.\n\nMolar tooth behind the crown also has cavities.  Do you drink a lot of sugary beverages such as soda, sweetened coffee/tea, energy drinks, sports drinks, and/or juices?  You have a very high risk of cavities and if not controlled, you will lose more teeth. emmadudlyke: Hi there!!\n\nThanks so much for the response and taking the time to help and share expertise.\n\nI had a long phone call with my dentist today to go through actually what the diagnosis was and how we would proceed. Upon taking out the old root canal yesterday and going to the level of the indicator - he didn’t find any fracture or cracks? It’s a fact, I have a very low level infection but he couldn’t find the source. My gut it that the issue lies on the sides of the crown. Anyway -  So I will be going in again to re do the process, sterilise and replace the temporary dressing with a more permanent one until I get a new crown. Is there any antibiotics I can take?\n\nFilling is happening on my next visit, thanks for spotting! \n\nRegarding sugar, and diet - I was 18 and didn’t think about these things and this was when the I caused damage to my teeth. Cross fingers I don’t have any other issues - I don’t eat sweets/ fizzy drinks/ energy drinks/ junk food and have cut out sugar for 2 weeks now bar from my fruit.  I floss everyday and have an electrical tooth brush... and occasionally oil pull. I have expertise in nutrition so I guess naturally I avoid these harmful sugary foods. emmadudlyke: Do you not think tooth extraction is for high level infection and damage? My dentist said it’s a good thing he didn’t find any cracks or fractures? \n\nI feel like perhaps he’s missing something... honestdoc: I feel better about you not consuming excessive sugary beverages and that you are flossing & brushing regularly.  We cannot detect root fractures below the bone level.  It is up to the dentist to restore the tooth.  Make sure the dentist perio probe around the area to  make sure the gums and bone are intact.  It would be a shame to invest in a crown and have to pull the tooth shortly afterwards.  Best wishes! MattKW: RCT looks v good. I would be strongly suspecting a vertical crack. You can't fix vertical root fractures, nor can they be detected on any type of x-ray. If your dentist isn't sure, then I would suggest you go see an endodontist before damaging the crown. I certainly wouldn't take out that RCT without very good reasons."

And if so can it generally be done with the removal of necrotic bone? Or is there a recovery period needed?\nAlso; what would be the cause of such a thing happening? Is it something I have done (so I can avoid it happening again) honestdoc: I don't think it is necrotic bone from this angle.  Necrotic bone looks very ugly and uneven.  I think it is developing epithelial tissue which is good.  Many times with undesired results such as necrotic bone, you cannot avoid it so don't worry, just get proper followups. Twinmumnz: Proper follow ups are hard when it's a $2000 return trip plus accomodation. Is it something that will heal in its own time? honestdoc: I'm sorry, I forgot about you going overseas.  With the image angle, I think it is healing properly with developing epithelial tissue.  I'm not sure if you can send the image to the surgeon for a quick eval.  A helpful image would be an x-ray to check bone density.  The denser the bone on x-ray, the whiter the image. Twinmumnz: Yes they wanted an xray/ct scan but I can't find anywhere that will do it here in NZ because I have been overseas.\n\nThere was no exposed bone a few weeks ago and it seems to be getting more and more as the weeks go by. honestdoc: I don't see any urgencies unless you have pain and or swelling.  I don't know how to respond in that your surgeon is overseas.  Many times it is best to have ready access to proper followups.  Sorry I may not be able to answer all of your questions. Twinmumnz: Thanks for trying.\nIt is painful noto horrendous but aching. And a splinter of bone came out when I sneezed last week.  I will see them on 21st, will up date you if you like. honestdoc: I'm sorry for your discomfort.  It is hard for me to examine just by the image.

I went to a dentist last year who did only composite fillings and had three large fillings replaced.  I don’t want amalgam filings.  He retired.  I just switched to a new dentist who is recommending crowns on almost ALL of my molars (which all have pretty large fillings by now).  Instead of waiting until a large filling had a problem, he recommended PREVENTATIVELY replacing each filling with a crown, as I can afford it, over several years.  He said the risk of having the large filings is that I might get a crack and would need a root canal, whereas with the crowns it is less likely that I will need root canals because they are much stronger.\n      My question is, does this make sense, or is he just trying to make more money? MattKW: This is fairly typical in dentistry. As the fillings get larger, there comes a point where the remaining thin teeth start fracturing, and a crown will encircle the tooth as the final measure (we hope!). Without seeing any x-rays and photos, I can't be specific about your teeth. All procedures carry some risks, so he has to discuss these with you.

Busybee: I'm not a dentist but  think of this logically re the mathematical dimensions.  The preparation for your existing crown was made on a tooth that will be drilled and reshaped following a root treatment.  How can it possible fit perfectly if it's put back on a different shaped/sized preparation?  If you have a root treatment it's important that the tooth is sealed well by a perfectly fitted crown.  Otherwise you just end up letting decay in leading to infection.  It's cheaper to do what your dentist suggests but could lead to more problems.   If there was decay after only two years it may be the crown didn't fit so well in the first place."

She had previously opened up some metal fillings from the 90s on a few other teeth and now I have terrible sensitivity -- she said a few visits ago that she wouldn't open this tooth up because it will \"certainly then need a root canal\" -- why does she suddenly want to then put a crown on it?  It is the only tooth left with a metal filling (from 20 years ago) but if she does this won't I just need to then get an unnecessary root canal and then have her put on the crown again?  Doesn't make sense to me.   The tooth has a filling down the side of it and on top (if that matters).  I just don't want to have to drop $600 on a crown after insurance to then find out that I will need a root canal for another $1000 and then more unexpected expense because the crown was done then a root canal and then another crown?  Thanks for any advice!!! MattKW: Yes, it makes you wonder what benefit you gained from replacing untroubled amalgams with testy composites. I can't give you much insight on the 18 without photos and x-ray, but given your recent experiences, I'd leave it alone."

Dr.med.dent HZ: http://bite-it.helsinki.fi/    plz read it Uptown101: Before Birth:\nBy the third week after conception the primitive mouth has formed. Over the next few weeks the tongue, \njaws and palate develop. During the sixth week formation of formation of embryonic cells or tooth buds\n that eventually form into teeth commences. By eight weeks, the tooth buds of all of the primary \n(baby) teeth can be discerned; by twenty weeks, the tooth buds of permanent teeth start to develop.\n\nAfter Birth:\nThe development of the teeth within the jaw continues after birth. Normally, the first\nprimary teeth start to appear in the mouth around six months after birth. The primary central incisors, \nlateral incisors, first molars, canines and second molars appear in this order at intervals from 6-24 months. \nFor each tooth type, lower teeth tend to appear about two months before the uppers. By age two and a half years, \nmost children have their full complement of 20 primary teeth - 10 teeth in the upper (top) jaw and 10 teeth in the lower\n bottom) jaw. As the child grows, the jaws also grow and spaces may begin to appear between \nthe primary teeth. This growth takes spaces for the larger permanent teeth.\n\nHope this helps."

    "title": "Tooth Pain after Filing",
    "dialogue": "firstone: Dear Group:\n\nI had two filings last Thursday (3/22) in the morning. I only expected to have a 2 stage replacement filing on tooth #15 but the dentist discovered that tooth #14 in the back that needed a 3 stage filling right next to the other one right around the flossing line at the base of the tooth in the back.\n\nMy sinuses and allergies were very poor and I was having great difficulty keeping my mouth wide open because of some muscle cramping on the opposite side of the mouth (lower right), thus I do not know if my filling stayed in or has come out. I probably needed some suction after the drilling ended but before application of the filling since I was having difficulty swallowing. I was given a composite filing. I had a hard time sleeping last night (but could sleep), thus I told the medical assistant at the front desk that my pain was about or 2 or 3 today (3/26) and was given a sample of Sensodyne toothpaste and asked if I felt pain when I drank hot or cold. I found out later it was after drinking cold. She said if my pain persisted till Monday 4/2 to come in or if it gets worse to come in immediately. So I don't know if the pain is caused by sensitivity or the absence of a filing.\n\nI was wondering if you had any ideas. I checked with the medical assistant of the dentist today because my aunt who was a retired dental assistant said to take care of that immediately as I had assumed that my filing fell out (which may or may not be true). They can squeeze me in Monday or Tuesday to take x-rays which would be 12 days after the filling was put in. Thanks. That said, because of the dentist bedside manner, I was thinking of changing to my wife's dentist for my next dental cleaning. I think after 7 years with the same dentist, I am just looking for a change even though I had been happy with the dentist in the past. Uptown101: It is fairly common for you to have some pain or sensitivity in the treated tooth after a filling. A dentist was just poking around and drilling in the tooth after all. Usually, any discomfort should fade after a day or two. The type of filling your dentist used can also cause sensitivity or discomfort in the tooth.\n\nHope this helps."

Whenever I chew on my right side, if I put too much pressure on the teeth or if I chew something that becomes very sandy/grainy, it'll get caught in my teeth and cause an annoying, sharp pain. Is this normal? Will this go away in a few days? Or did my dentist mess up somehow? Thanks for the help MattKW: Go back and check it up. It sounds like you might've had cavities between your teeth, and sometimes it can be difficult to make the contacts tight again. Uptown101: Avoid any hard, chewy, or sticky foods after a dental filling for up to two weeks. If you are experiencing tooth sensitivity you may also benefit from avoiding hot or cold drinks and foods. There is no need to wait to brush your teeth after a dental filling. You can continue brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing once a day. Hope it helps."

I was surprised because I haven't had cavities in a long time, but I also haven't had x-rays in a long time, so it didn't seem too crazy.\n\nI went back for two fillings today and the care plan they gave me showed 7 fillings they want to do. Does 7 fillings seem normal? I'm not having any pain whatsoever, so I dunno if I want to do that many.\n\nAnd, on top of that, after the two today, my bit feels a little high, even after the dentist adjusted the filling while I was still at the office. Will my bite even out or should I call Monday and see if the dentist can adjust it more?\n\nI'm just feeling weird about all of this and want to be cautious about have that many teeth filled if the cavities are small and since I'm experiencing no pain or sensitivity. Thanks for any advice. Busybee: Get a second opinion. deepsun: I might do that. As it stands, I've now been experiencing ongoing sensitivity in the teeth that were filled, even when I'm not eating, and the filling was last Friday. After a phone call to the dentist yesterday, I was just told to try Sensodyne and call back this Friday if I'm still having issues. It's extremely upsetting because I had no pain or sensitivity before the filling, and now I'm taking OTC pain medication and not enjoying eating because of the fillings. Busybee: Ask them for your x rays and when you go for the second opinion make sure that dentist has them.   I would agree with the dentist about sensitivity.    Although if you had small cavities and you now have sensitivity that would indicate the fillings are quite large.    But the good news is that the sensitivity should go after about 3 months at the most.   It can take longer but generally if it's still there after that then you need it looked at.    If they are too high then that can also make sensitivity worse, teeth can also crack if fillings are too high.  \n\nBut I'd not really trust a dentist who did this to me to fix things.  I'd find a really good dentist to assess this because you want someone who listens to your concerns and knows how to take you out of pain."

    "title": "Do heavy grinders require special bonding agents for fillings? (I cannot chew from pain, pls help)",
    "dialogue": "abctooth: Hello everyone,\n\nA month ago I had 7 filling replacements done at a new dental office. 3 molars have been giving me pain around the top of the tooth when chewing and flossing. Shortly after I developed moderate hot and cold sensitivity too. They have been hurting for a month now with no signs of improvement. I've never had pain like this before after a filling. Because the pain is on both sides I'm not chewing and I've been going on pureed food for a month now. Please help! I'm worried about the future of my teeth and my dental office doesn't seem very knowledgeable about the issue. Any help is much appreciated!\n\n5 days ago another dentist at the same office replaced one of the painful fillings that dentist #1 had done. He took longer doing it and applied the light gun more times, which makes me think he may have used a different bonding agent and/or technique (perhaps incremental cure?). The new filling is giving me the same pressure pain, but lower intensity (50% compared to the first) and not much hot and cold sensitivity so far.\n\nNeither dentist used a dental dam when doing the fillings.\n\nBoth dentists mentioned that 'microgaps' are likely to blame for this pain. They said the microgaps can't be seen on the x-ray and they don't know why they are there. I told them both about my grinding problem and even asked dentist #2 directly if grinding could be the reason why the bond isn't holding. He shrugged and said no. Both dentists have about 10 years of experience.\n\nMy question: could I be getting this pressure pain because (1) I'm a heavy grinder and (2) the grinding has affected the internal enamel structure of my molars (perhaps akin to craze lines), (3) making it more difficult for the filling to bond to my tooth?\n\nI am a heavy night grinder. I've been wearing a hard plastic night guard on my top teeth regularly for several years. By now there are grooves worn into the guard from the bottom teeth but no holes. I often wake up with tenderness in my jaw. The molars with the most painful fillings are the third from the end on each lower side (i.e. tooth #6 from the center), exactly where I grind most heavily.\n\nI found this quote on Reddit:\n\nComposite is something that binds to the tooth on a very fine level, as such, stressing the bond by having sharp angles and undercut areas in the enamel, you can have an unfavourable result and have a poor bond. Polishing it and making sure the enamel is supported by dentine is the best way to make sure this doesn't happen.​\nCould it be that grinding force over the years (even with nightguard) has caused 'sharp angles and undercut areas in the enamel', perhaps similar to craze lines on a micro scale? I'm a big guy (6'1) and the dentist who made my nightguard told me I have a very powerful jaw.\n\nAnother person suggested avoiding anything but 4th generation bonding agents:\n\nMake sure to get it done with a rubber dam, and a good bonding agent, if they use an all in one binding agent or prime and born NT run. ... I favor 4th generation prime and bonds like optibond FL. If the dentist knows what I mean by a rubber dam and a 4th generation bonding agent, you are in good hands.​\nI'm assuming this is because the two-in-one (or all-in-one) combinations make for a weaker bond especially where there are structure issues with the enamel.\n\nSomeone else said to use incremental cure instead of bulk cure:\n\nWorst case, have him do the filling again and ask him to \"incremental cure\" the filling rather than \"bulk cure\". Dental terminology, but he'll understand. ​\nIs incremental cure related to the generation of bonding agent or is it a separate aspect of the filling procedure?\n\nThis pain is interfering with my life and makes me worried about the future of my teeth. I want to find out the cause of this pain so I know what to do from now on. Could the poor bonding in these fillings really be caused by the effects of grinding (perhaps also by cheap bonding agent and quick procedures used by dentists #1 and #2)? Is it likely that the rest of the 7 fillings will give me pain in the future? Are there any special procedures that grinders like me should ask for when getting dental work done?\n\nAny input would be helpful. Thank you! Busybee: I'm a heavy grinder but the only time I've had similar symptoms to yours is when a dentist tried to build up my bite without really know what they were doing.  It could be that your fillings are too high and need adjusting.  I also thought that it was down to poor material or technique but they are settled and I rarely have sensitivity or pain now.  So my hunch would be that it's your bite & the trauma.  Seven fillings will change your bite and it's a lot of trauma for the teeth too.  They do etch with acid and that can go all over the place.  In my experience any filing can give sensitivity up to three months but can be even longer.  If they have not been done carefully enough it will carry on as there can be pockets where the nerve is too close as filling material didn't cover the area properly.  I had one such area fixed with a blob of composite and it's fine now.   Otherwise they settled with adjustments.     The sensitivity can vanish just as suddenly as it appears.  Give it more time. \n\nNB I don't personally think dental dams make much difference.  They just pacify the patient. MattKW: Composites shrink on setting with the light, therefore bulk fill is poorer than incremental fill. \n\nAll-in-one bonding is usually quite weak on enamel, which is where you need it most.\nComposites shrink less than early days, but still some shrinkage (compared to amalgams), and bond can deteriorate. Therefore, more likely to get post-op sensitivity with comps than amalgams.\nRubber dam is ideal, but can be managed without in selected cases.\nEvery time a filling is replaced, the nerve is damaged, and you go thru post-op pain again, and likelihood of nerve settling diminishes.\nWhy did you have the fillings replaced anyway? Busybee: Matt just out of interest why are dental dams necessary?  It's just that most of my dental life I had no dental dam and everything was fine after dental work.  Recently all dentists are using them.   I first came across them in the early 90s but it was a one off and I didn't see them again until a couple of years ago.   \n\nThey make me feel claustrophobic, I feel like I'm gagging (cannot swallow) and I can't communicate.    It feels like a barrier between dentist and patient. MattKW: Dental dams are manadtory for RCTs because of risk of dropping fine instruments down the throat. They are useful for general work as:\n\nFor the dentist, keeps the tongue, cheeks, saliva away from the work. Reduces risk of filling material going down back of throat during removal or replacement. It's rare to lose something down back of throat as most patients keep closed, and have good reflexes, but I've had a few which worried me at the time and had to send off for chest Xrays (don't want stuff in lungs, OK for tummy).\n\nComposites are sensitive to moisture when being placed, and there is a school of thought that that even the moisture in the patient breath can interfere with the bonding.\n\nMost patients rather prefer dam as it leaves their mouth cleaner during the procedure. But some don't like it. Communication is more difficult, and some people just like the chance to sit up occasionally and rinse.\nI always use dam for RCTs, and occasionally for other treatment when I have difficulty in keeping the area dry. That said, I place amalgams still where I think the patient will be better served, and amalgams are almost unaffected by moisture. Younger dentists are being trained more for use of dams as everyday treatment. Busybee: I can understand for root treatment but for routine stuff it's nice to be able to rinse and breathe through the mouth in between stages.  Particularly when your throat feels numbed up too.   I prefer amalgam fillings but most private dentists have stopped doing them. abctooth: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\nComposites shrink on setting with the light, therefore bulk fill is poorer than incremental fill. \n\nAll-in-one bonding is usually quite weak on enamel, which is where you need it most.\nComposites shrink less than early days, but still some shrinkage (compared to amalgams), and bond can deteriorate.

They were old fillings and the dentist (dentist #1) found cavities underneath. He put in a filling 3 weeks ago which immediately gave me chewing and flossing pain. Dentist #2 took out this new filling and put in a second filling. This is giving me the same pain but not as strong. It's not going away 1 week later but seems to be getting worse. Both dentists mentioned \"microgaps\" may be the reason for the pain in the fillings. I'm trying to figure out why these microgaps are there and why the bond isn't strong.\n\nDo you think that teeth grinding could be creating these microgaps (which then are making the bond weaker and giving me pain)? I've been a grinder for years and often have jaw sensitivity in the morning. I read that grinding can cause craze lines. Can it can also cause small fissures/gaps in the molar enamel that affect the bonding? \n\nAnother thing, if the bond with the enamel isn't tight does this mean bacteria will be seeping through and causing decay inside the tooth? \n\nI really want to get to the bottom of this so I can keep my teeth. I'm in my early 30s, lots of dental problems in my family. My uncle lost all his teeth before his 50s. abctooth: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI'm a heavy grinder but the only time I've had similar symptoms to yours is when a dentist tried to build up my bite without really know what they were doing.

I felt pain in my jaw, even running down the neck and up into the ear (as if I have an ear infection). The teeth above where the bite was high also got sensitive. \n\nBut here's the issue. I have pain in my tooth on the right side, where the bite never needed an adjustment (the bite was high on the left). The dentist spent a lot of time on the right side bite and made it almost perfect. But the pain in the tooth on the right (when chewing and flossing) is still there. This makes me think that it's not the bite and that the bond may be the problem. That's why I've been looking into bonding agents and the link between grinding and the filling bond (through \"microgaps\" and such). MattKW: Any chance of Xrays from the dentists? abctooth: Hi Matt, I just got the x-rays. I'm attaching what I received from the dental office. They have no labels unfortunately. I believe these were taken after the fillings were done. I'm sorry I can't narrow it down any more, I simply don't know what is what in these images. The main problems are in 36 and 46. I think 27 may be problematic also. \n\nThank you."

I have no dental insurance, but I can put $2,500 on this up front if needed. I was thinking a \"form & pour\", like concrete, but I'm ignorant as to modern dental practices. There is no pain YET, but I fear things may get much worse if I defer this any longer.\nAre there any experts that can advise me PLEASE? Any reco's in the Tampa Bay, Florida area?\n\nThank you in advance for professional advice by dental experts. \n\nFYI, I have over 20 years experience in Florida roofing and asphalt paving, AKA veteran, in the event anyone has a question about those matters...... MattKW: That tooth is probably a goner. When they're that decayed, there'll be more decay underneath, and nerve involvement likely. So, then you'd have to RCT, and at a minimum a prefab post with big filling on top; otherwise cast post-and-core, then crown. Either of these options will still be doubtful in long term.  I'd suggest extraction, and use the saved money to check other teeth for other problems. jimmythelockfl: Thank you, sir, your advice is very much appreciated. I have a dentist appt. set for Monday. MattKW, can you ballpark the cost, with no insurance, for an RCT, prefab post, and big filling? ( this seems like the most economical) as opposed to the ideal solution.( most expensive)? 2K to 5k? I don't want to go half ass here, I need all my teeth, I like kissing girls, and I'm willing to spend up to 10K if required to \"fix\" the problem long term.\n\nI did have extensive braces and wisdom teeth removed when I was under the \"parents\" umbrella and checkbook.

His plan to restore my bite seems good on paper, but I worry it's going to snowball (more issues will arise as he works on all of my teeth) and become more costly in the future. Is there no way I can just get these two teeth crowned and move on with my life? I can live with the bite, but missing a huge lower tooth is really messing with me. Busybee: How frustrating for you!  It can take forever to restore a bite and in the meantime you can end up with more problems and living with temps etc is not good and can also mess up your bite even more.  Of course at the same time some of the problems you've had may be down to the bad bite.   The dentist doesn't want the restorations to fail so he's being cautious for your sake.    What is the plan for restoring the bite?  It's really not that simple a task and you can end up in more discomfort and with different problems. Dental Impatient: He wants to build up my front teeth and maybe do some veneers so they touch and guide, then do the back teeth in a second phase with some composite some new crowns where badly needed etc. Like I said sounds good on paper but I'm very iffy at this point. He did a mold and has a model but I feel like he'll get it perfect from a dentistry standpoint and my jaw will just do its own thing. There's a chance any of these back filings will need a root canal if they're opened up again so I posed that concern and waiting for a response. If I end up with a bunch of extra work this could wind up costing 20k Busybee: Sounds very lucrative for him.  Does he have a back up plan for guaranteeing the finances don't go up if any of his plan doesn't work out? Dental Impatient: Well. The last message I relayed was the concern that I had 7-8 large fillings in the back, that if they reveal the need for a root canal and crown while he's messing with them, will completely hose me on cost. I had broken a filling and gone in to see him, and the cavity was to the nerve, so I had a root canal the other day. All of these other fillings are about as old as that one. Ticking time bombs. Of course, once he's in there what's done is done. A root canal and a crown typically cost about $700 for one tooth, assuming I haven't wiped out my benefits for the year, which would easily happen if several teeth do that. So I don't know what he's going to say to put my mind at ease. Busybee: So you mentioned your \"current\" dentist.  Is that not the dentist who did the temp filling and pulled your tooth and plans to implant?   I was just wondering if your dentist changed his mind about what to do after having made an initial treatment plan for you.  You also mention both an implant and a bridge - is that for the same tooth that was pulled? Dental Impatient: Tooth 19 was a mess. It was the first tooth I ever had work on. Over the pass 10-12 years it's had two root canals and four crowns. Barely any surface left. We discussed both options for replacing (implant and bridge), initially I had thought the bridge sounded more logical, but quickly became deadset on an implant. He thinks that putting a regular crown on it once the implant is in, with my bite, will potentionally cause trauma to and maybe even loosen the implant in my jaw, so he wants to go through this lofty grand plan while he puts a composite/provisional crown there in the meantime. Busybee: It does sound as though that missing tooth implant would be exposed to too much pressure if you have had the original tooth redone so  many times.  There is an underlying problem.   If you waste money on an implant that's bound to fail then you are throwing it down the drain because you'd have to have it redone and maybe face failure again.   You don't always need to open up fillings if they are composite in order to build them up.  You only have to do this if they are amalgam.   Or the filling can be taken down a little rather than completely removed.  Can he not build up the front teeth with composite too?  Veneers usually require the removal of natural tooth.   An alternative is to grind down the back teeth and that's a lot cheaper but can cause just as many problems as building them up.   Plus it is irreversible removal of natural tooth which cannot be replaced.   It takes a rare dentist who can really fix bite because bite is very complex.  It takes a lot of time and it's hard to adjust to changes because your brain is looking for places the muscles in the jaw used to recognise.   Badly done bite adjustments can cause headaches, jaw pain, neck pain and even backache.  Can also cause pain in other teeth and ringing in the ears.  No two dentists will have the same approach and there is no such thing as a bite specialist.   Exceptional skills aside, the most important thing is that you feel you can talk to your dentist and that you feel your dentist is really listening to you.    I hope your dentist is a restorative and implant specialist.   Have you thought of getting a second opinion? Dental Impatient: He is the second opinion, but now I am leaning toward third and fourth and beyond. The first opinion was asinine, he just wanted to crown all my teeth (for 15k). This second guy is not an implant specialist or prosthodontist, he is an older and clearly very experienced DDS. I do like his demeanor and the fact that he will work with me on cost and talk to me, but I feel like this procedure will end up costing triple what he is telling me it will be, and I may not end up better for it. I'm probably going to tell him on Monday that I've changed my mind again.\n\nAs far as #19 goes, yes, it had to be redone a lot, but I feel that was less about the bite and more about that particular tooth and certain circumstances. I had not seen a dentist for 7 years at that point (which I'm paying for now). It had a large cavity and needed a root canal (throbbing, excruciating pain). The root canal was done first, and then the first crown was placed. That was the point where I became serious and picked a dentist to start going to. I ended up needing 19 fillings done, which were done over the course of a year, and I'm pretty sure that's what hosed my bite. Anyway, eventually that first (ill fitting) crown broke and took a huge chunk of the tooth with it. They did another root canal for good measure and inserted a post, then crowned it again. That crown became - unglued? - basically it could be wiggled back and forth in place. He was not able to reattach that one, so another one was done. By that point there was too little tooth surface. Finally this new guy saw a shadow on the X-Ray under the crown that hadn't been there three months prior and we extracted.\n\nI've got some tough conversations to had. I'm going to reach out to the oral surgeon and get more information about the implant I'm slated to get and how the bite could adversely affect it. With my current dentist I'm going to put the kaibosh on this grand scheme, and probably go get some other opinions.\n\nIn my mind I still want to proceed with the implant. The longer I wait the more likely it is I'll need a bone graft to get it later. After it's placed I will still have time to decide how to proceed. Busybee: 19 fillings are bound to alter your bite.   It's not normal for a crown on that size tooth in the position you described to break the tooth off.     Even if it's badly fitted it's not likely to be under that kind of pressure because it's a grinder rather than a slider.   So there must be some unusual dynamic in your mouth.   I'm just going by the same teeth in my mouth and they don't touch the sides of the upper teeth with any force.  When I chew they grind the food but they are protected from breakage by their position and the surrounding teeth.   It's possible that the original filling was so large they had little tooth to work with to place the crowns.  I think your current dentist is right to be cautious as you have now entered the category of someone with a complex issue.   I'm guessing you are in the US where they tend to be quite aggressive in their approach to treatment.  They will try to \"fix\" the bite with lots of restorations.   In the UK you'd find it the opposite with nobody  wanting to deal with your current situation because it's so complex that anything they do could go wrong and cause greater problems.   You should have been given a night guard a long time ago if you grind at night.   If you go from dentist to dentist I'm sure you will find someone who will charge you for placing the implant, but you may find it fails if the bite is putting pressure on the tooth.    You should really see a specialist in restorative dentistry. Dental Impatient: You're right about the size of the cavity, I think. They had to do \"buildup\" on several occasions to get crowns in there. I have several other crowns on molars and none of them have behaved this way. I'm a grinder and I have a terrible unconscious nail biting habit.\n\nAnd you're right about the aggressiveness. In every scenario I'm given, it's a huge undertaking and overhaul of my mouth. At the end of these roads, I might be 20k dollars poorer and have a worse situation. The night guard is a good call, I've never worn one in the past because they'll typically charge me $300 for one, and it changes whenever you have work done and needs to be redone, but given the alternatives this would actually be a much cheaper option at this point, to get an implant and the two crowns I need, and then get a night guard made. I've always claimed I can't wear one due to gag reflex, but that is just an excuse. I've managed to get comfortable enough with the spacer apparatus that my current dentist made that keeps 18 and 20 from floating together that I can wear it while I sleep. I should be able to handle a guard now."

I haven't had them before, but if I have, it's been a very long time.\n\nYesterday, I had an appointment to get fillings for some of my teeth because of cavities and where plaque damaged my teeth (I guess that's the right word). My dentist was only able to do the top left canine and the two on both sides of it because he said my gums were bleeding so much that he couldn't really do much work. But I have another appointment in two weeks to pick up where he left off.\n\nLast night, when I was brushing my teeth, I noticed that there's the tiny black spot right where my canine meets my gums. I also noticed that it kinda seems like he pushed my gums up, if that makes sense. The black spot doesn't hurt, but my gums around that area do. I also noted there's kind of a sore spot on my gums, and I assume it's from where he injected the numbing medicine in my gums. That spot specifically hurts a lot. I can only describe it as like when you have a knot from hitting something or a bruise and you touch it by mistake. But even my tongue touching it hurts which is strange to me.\n\nI'm wondering if the spot could just be a bruise from the drill or something like that. Also, how long does the pain typically last?\n\nThanks in advance. Like I said, I'm new to fillings so I'm not sure what exactly is going on. I appreciate the help. TaeTae: I also noticed there's a small knot where they injected the medicine. It's gone down but I thought I'd add that in case it means anything."

    "dialogue": "thenna: Hi There,\nI met with an accident last month and lost one of my rabbit teeth. A dentist helped me in doing a root canal and advised me to do post and core followed by placinng a crown. He is suggesting ceramic crown which comes around $1500 NZD approx.\n\n\nCould you please help me to identify which crown type is best for front tooth after post and core? \n\nIs Emax crown better than a ceramic crown in my case for front tooth?\nYour response is highly appreciated. Thanks. KVMCruces: Emax crowns are aesthetically great for anterior teeth but can be costly for you as the patient. Zirconia (PFZ crown) is another great option.\nDepending on what dental lab your dentist uses, there are other ceramic materials available that can be used that look great and are more cost friendly. (I can recommend a dental lab that offers specials for dentists to give to their patients if youre interested) MattKW: By rabbit tooth you mean central incisor? If it's broken off at gumline, then a cast post and core is best. If you still have some tooth above gumline then maybe prefabricated stainless steel post and composite core. Type of crown doesn't really matter with regards to strength. If your tooth ever breaks it'll be through the post and core, not the crown. eMax gives very natural-looking results (it's a ceramic); standard PFM can also do well, especially if you have a tight bite (ceramic plus metal base); zirconia (it's a ceramic) has no advantage over these two. KVMCruces: 100% disagree with using PFM for an anterior tooth. I haven't made one of those in over 6 years.\n\nEmax is great but very  weak compared to Zirconia.\nThere are new advanced materials that offer both aesthetics and strength. Pritidenta introduced their new ET (extra translucent) Zirconia material this month in Chicago for Lab Day.\n\nI got my hands on the material and have done about 6 anterior cases with it. So far, nothing but great feedback on it."

I have had a number of standard GICs placed, probably in the region of about 10, and they've all broken after a couple of weeks or a few months. The tooth is broken sub-gingivally and my dentist doesn't think he can get a composite filling on it because he doesn't think he can keep the tooth dry enough.\n\nI've asked about trying a resin-reinforced GIC, GC Fuji II LC looks to me about the best, but he doesn't stock it or any other resin-reinforced GIC and doesn't want to buy one just for me, of course.\n\nWhat should I go for? Should I look around for a dentist who does have resin-reinforced GICs? Should I expect the dental profession to say that a prosthetic crown is the only way to treat the tooth now? The owner of the practice I go to has even suggested the tooth might easily warrant extraction.\n\nThe tooth is root-filled and already has substantial composite repair.\n\nSorry about the grunge in the photo – I only went to the hygienist about a month and a half ago. MattKW: A resin GIC won't make any difference. I'd suggest you place 2 (or even 3) posts in the RCT, and rebuild in amalgam. Also shorten the buccal cusps by ~1mm. The filling doesn't have to be back to full size with cusps, but it can work satisfactorily. Nothing really goes well under the gum, but amalgam isn't as fussy as composite or GIC. The long term chances for this tooth are poor, and a crown won't make it better. I've got a number of patients with half teeth still functioning after 10 years. Robert Tucker: Oh, I had an all porcelain crown fitted last November/December. MattKW: Woah! Sorry about that. I hadn't looked at date of your thread. Best wishes."

    "title": "How can the dentist build up teeth that have been ground down",
    "dialogue": "AndyM: My wife's is gradually grinding down her teeth to the point where she now hits the insides of her front teeth and is slowly pushing them out.  She just had to have two crowns on one side to save the teeth since they were so worn and chipped.  She was told from the dentist that he almost couldn't save one of the teeth.\n\nThe issue is her bite coming closer together because of her grinding, despite her mouth guard.  If so much as a seed gets in her teeth, then she doesn't smack her front teeth any more when chewing.  So for a fix, can't a dentist raise two crowns on each side of the mouth slightly by making slightly taller crowns.  Would this have to happen to every tooth of the mouth or can it be done on just two or three on each side.  I know there is the concern about too few crowns and you could chip the crowns but she is either going to chip her front teeth or push them out if something isn't done.\n\nI am really annoyed that some dentists just want to Band-Aid the problem by putting crowns on the front teeth too!  Two dentists have mentioned this.  We want a fix and nobody seems to have a solution to slowly build teeth back up.  If they did, they would be rich, guaranteed.   So frustrating.  I really wish I knew how to help return her bite/teeth close to how they were.\n\nThank you in advance for any advice you might have on this. Amed Abraham: i think in that case there are 3 steps to try and get back to as normal condition as possible, The first is getting the gums to go back to where they belong and This is done with either a minor surgery or with braces. Occasionally, if the gums are not too bad, everything can be done in just one step and laser is used to make minor adjustments to the gums.  The second step is to build back what was lost.  This is done with all ceramic crowns or veneers.  The final step is to protect what's been rebuilt/restored. Busybee: Hi Andy, dentists are very conservative about rebuilding the bite because so much can go wrong.   The important thing to understand is why the grinding is happening.  Because if she has lots of dental restorations and continues to grind then she could end up in a lot of pain and break the restorations.  Dental restorations do not feel the same as a natural tooth and they may cause other problems such as root failure.   \n\nIt's really difficult for any dentist to rebuild the natural bite.  But any specialist you see will want your wife to work on changing her grinding habit before they proceed with work.  They will want to diagnose why the problem is happening.  She should have a bite analysis with a specialist and then work out a treatment plan.   It is very difficult to fix a bite problem.   General dentists are not experts in this area.  Nobody really is, but specialists understand it a bit better and can give you more options for treatment.\n\nGoing for radical treatment is dangerous because she could end up with bigger problems.  This type of problem requires a well planned and careful approach.  You could for example ask a dentist if they could build up some of the teeth with temporary filling material to give her an idea of how it feels.   It's very hit and miss and she may not like the changes.  \n\nDoing this badly can affect the shape of the face, give you TMJ pain, pain in the neck and shoulders and lead to a viscious cycle of people trying to fix it.  Go to a specialist or two.  Get some advice. AndyM: Thank you for the inputs.  Yes, grinding is a difficult thing to find a cure for.  I agree that this would be one avenue to tackle.  Many people grind from when they were children.  That is a needle in a haystack.\n\nStill, we must somehow fix her bite.  Even if she never grinds again, we now have a problem with her bite and her front teeth. Busybee: A bite specialist should be able to diagnose why it's happening and recommend treatment options.   You just need to be aware that there are risks with building up teeth or grinding them down.  She may be uncomfortable with any changes and they tend to be irreversible. MattKW: This is an increasing problem with ageing population. Crowns can be difficult because there may not be enough tooth left to hold it in place. I have seen patients snap through crowns at gum margin. Better option is to rebuild in composite all the teeth. Very cost-effective and good results. Can also be a test for possible usefulness of crowns later if desired, but I have not found the need for this in my rebuilds yet. Also need to assess rest of teeth; if your wife only has front teeth, then it would help to look at replacement back teeth to spread the chewing, be this by dentures, bridges, or implants."

He feels that in the event of an implant the other caps should be replaced anyway as the fit is not now perfect with a little gap betweent he cap and the gum line.\n\nHe reckons on balance the bridge is the best option.\n\nI would really appreciate your thoughts please. Fortunately I am lucky in that money is not a concern, I just want the best solution.\n\nThere are possbly a couple of other considerations. I am 60, so would like something that will last well despite my age! I also slightly dread have a missing front tooth if I have an implant (for the time it takes to bond with my jaw).\n\nFinally, one other question. I didnt fully take in my dentist's comment about the bridge work. I know he said he would fit a temporary bridge straight away, but I am not sure how long he felt this should remain in place to allow the gum to heal? What would be normal and is it possible to pay an additional fee and have the final bridge made and fitted more quickly and would there be any disadvantages. I also gather that a bridge will place existing stress on the remaining teeth, is there anything that can be done to improve its durability?\n\nThank you Busybee: So sorry to hear about your cracked root.  I don't have a bridge or implant (yet!) but I do worry about needing one in the future if anything happens to my front crowns, but if you are not having any symptoms I'd get a second opinion on whether there are any other options.  It's just that a cracked root is meant to be excruciatingly painful.   If it were my mouth I'd try the implant and if it doesn't work out then go for a bridge.  If you have enough bone and it works out then the other teeth aren't going to be weakened.  You can always have a bridge later.   I understand that people wear temp bridges for months if necessary.  It can take a bit of getting used to.  The other thing to note is that bone can reduce in the area where there is no tooth.   That's one reason they recommend implants.  But you do need to go a to really good specialist.  I have friends who have had problems with poorly fitted implants.   You may need it replaced in ten years.  The other thing to consider is the amount of hygiene with a bridge.  There's also special cleaning for an implant but maybe easier to clean around it. MattKW: Since the other teeth are already crowned and holding well, I would go for the bridge too. An implant is more suited when the adjacent teeth have not been damaged by previous fillings or crowns. An implant is a whole new scenario with its own risks. And when implants fail, you don't simply drop in a new one. It wouldn't hurt to get a second opinion."

I am happy with the color, and the fit is really good, actually.  HOWEVER, I am so disappointed with the shape of tooth #7. It is too small and slanted and actually looks like I had chipped the tooth and simply had the chip smoothed down. The 3 teeth remind me of sawteeth. And yes, I did look in the mirror and realize I agreed to this extremely expensive unhappiness. When I smile, my lip covers most of my teeth, just like before the bridge, but now all that shows are the sawteeth that look more like 3 canines. The dentist knows I am unhappy and promised to call me back, but that was weeks ago. I am embarrassed to whine to the dental team after I agreed to it.\nI was so focused on the color and feel, it never occurred to me to focus on the appearance of the bottom edge. I know I am stuck with this unless I pay again for my oversight, or stupidity, which obviously fits me appropriately.\n\nMy question... I saw online where a lady had chipped her crown and the dentist was able to fuse something to it without removal. Link at bottom, so far, the repair has held for 6 years and is still adhering perfectly. Can my tooth #7 be built up?\nI live in Martinsburg, WV. Busybee: They could adjust the tooth to try to make it look less slanted.   I'm sure they can fuse composite to porcelain but it won't look so good and it could fall off any time.  What does the other side look like? Amber Sky: The other side looks normal---no saw teeth or black triangles. I don't have a photo of that side, tho.Thank you for your reply. I really appreciate the input! Busybee: If you are not happy the only way is to replace it.  You should ask to try in the replacement before fitting to ensure that you like it.  Dentists are never happy to do rework because it eats into income.   I can see why you're not happy. MattKW: Bonding composite to porcelain will fail in time. He might be embarrassed too if he knows you're unhappy. I'd bite the bullet now and make an appointment to talk to the dentist. Approaching nicely will get a much better result than aggression. Ask it like: \"Can you suggest a way to fix this?\". He might do another for lab cost only or reduced fee. Sometimes liability insurance covers dentists for these mishaps. Get onto it now."

If you're in the Georgia area I would be happy to refer you to them or you can have your local dentist contact the lab. Busybee: I wouldn't personally rush into changing it unless there's a structural problem or open margin.  Try adjusting first.  There is always a risk with changing dental work because it can trigger the root to die.  It shouldn't happen but it's a risk.

Busybee: When they remove the crown they can put on a strong temporary which can be put on and worn for months while you save for the permanent crown.  It's not ideal but that's one way to spend less now.   I think you can wear them for about a year.  But it has to be well made of special material to last that long and cemented on strongly. oao: Thanks.

    "dialogue": "ZiggyT: I got a filling in an upper wisdom tooth 9 days ago.  I have had a dull ache on that side off and on since.  I have also had a couple of times where my tooth seemed very sensitive to cold. It hurts a little to chew on that side.  Sometimes the pain seems to be coming from at tooth two teeth down.  I have great teeth, only three small cavities before this for 57 years.  When the filling was done, the tooth was not numbed properly at first and it hurt a lot when he first started drilling--he had to inject more anesthetic.  Is this something that will get better over time? Robert Tucker: Was it a composite filling? If so was it lined? If you have an unlined composite filling sensitive to (hot and/or) cold, I cannot recommend strongly enough that you have it replaced lined. ZiggyT: Why? Robert Tucker: Because composite fillings contain substances that are toxic to the pulp if not throughout your body. My two experiences with unlined composite fillings is one of bouts of pain that had me bent double and ended up needing a root canal treatment and one lasting several minutes in worse-than-death agony – a pain level near that of the drill on an unsedated tooth. The idea, apparently, is that without the lining, the dentine tubules are held together better. Busybee: It should get better over time.  I've had similar problems and they eventually go.  But get another dentist to look to be on the safe side.  A dentist that works on your tooth before it's numb is not one you want to go back to maybe."

I had a nasty accident 6 months ago now which resulted in my faceplanting the ground after I was pulled over by a dog and damaging four teeth. Two have healed perfectly, just a bit chipped, but my two front teeth are badly chipped and still quite sore. \nIn the six months since the accident I've had to get a root canal on one after it died but it's still feeling bruised and I can't bite down on my bottom teeth without discomfort or use them to bite anything other than extremely soft foods.\n\nI'm just wondering if 6 months is normal? Should they be taking this long to heal and should I still feel bruised and tender when touching them? My dentist just says that everyone heals differently but I'm now worried that I've done a lot more damage and they're going to have to be replaced with implants which I can't afford. \nThanks Dipsey: If the painful teeth are chipped the nerve maybe exposed and may need a composite filling to seal the tooth. The teeth may still be too mobile and sometimes you can do a temporary composite bridge to fix the wobbly teeth to adjacent strong teeth so the roots have time to heal and can't move about when eating."

If this is it - well it is caused by wrong strokes used in brushing plus using a hard-bristled brush.  You may be abrading the surfaces of your teeth due to this wrong practice.  And yes, if you don't correct your brushing technique your teeth could really crack, soon.\n\nAlthough, this kind of filling can easily dislodge also - at least it can protect or be a temporary remedy, if not properly taken care of.\n\nIf you may be in doubt of any treatment suggested to you by a dentist, you may always seek a second opinion, a third or more until someone can offer other treatment options that is agreeable to both parties.

My teeth were generally health so far, and this is the first time I had anything done to it other than regular cleaning. I  regret of not having taken second opinion for two reasons- 1. Crown involves such significant filing of the original teeth- I hadn't realized the extent to which it would be filed 2. Price. My question is, does crowns seem reasonable for my symptoms? Would a dental bonding (or some other procedure) have been an alternative procedure to consider, just from the description of the symptoms? How long might the crowns last? Is it possible to last a lifetime? I know its too late to undo anything at this point, but would like to get some advice for any future problems that might be similar."

Jennifer L: Hi there. I had a front tooth misaligned and also wanted an alternative to orthodontia. I did find an alternative that worked well for me; however, my misaligned tooth was inside/behind the other teeth. The treatment was to build up that tooth to meet the outer \"ring\" of teeth. So that solution won't work in your case.  However, the advice that might be helpful is to seek a cosmetic dentist.  (That's a legitimate thing in the U.S., but I'm not sure if that's everywhere!  This is a perfect-teeth obsessed nation.)  Basically, a cosmetic dentist can/will advise on appearance, even if it might ignore a more comprehensive repair of an overall problem. In the U.S., this is not usually covered by insurance.  I paid (I think) around $800-$1,000 US.\n\nHere's a photo.

    "dialogue": "Bridge Seeker: I am seeing a restorative dentist but would like a second opinion. \n\nI was born without upper lateral incisors. I was given Maryland bridges attached to my canines. They went through a lot.\n\nOne of them came out around 11 years later after it experienced a knock. The other one is still in over 12 years later.\n\nThere have been two failed attempts to replace it. The first replacement was a direct composite bridge, which lasted only for half a year and was attached to both the canine and central incisor. The second was a normal Maryland bridge and was again attached to the canine, like the first time. This only lasted 4 days before falling out! \n\nI'm seeing a specialist restorative dentist who wants to replace both teeth at the same time, and build one long composite metal bridgework that runs behind the lateral incisors. There would therefore be a metal bar attaching the structure along the inner side of the front teeth.\n\nI have many concerns about this method, which I was unable to dicuss in depth becuase I felt pressured because of appointment times. The dentist has etched a horizontal groove at the back of my central incisors to guide the technicians on what to do. I didn’t expect the groove to be that deep so close to the bottom of the front teeth, where I've been told by a dentist that I have slightly weak spots of enamel. Obviously I will never have that enamel back and feel sad that it was done just to aid the technicians.\n\nAs I said, I have many doubts about the mechanics of all of this and the adverse effdcts on my front teeth. If all of them are attached together, won't that make the whole structure more vunerable isntead of weak? One false tooth is damaged and so that means the rest of the structure is upset becuase it's all attached together? \n\nI have no idea what do"

I was in their for about 50 minutes :/\n\nAfter the extraction I was in terrible pain 2 days later I also felt pain coming from another tooth in the bottom left area number 5 or 6  I think its a pre-molar It was giving me a sharp shooting pain, if I bite my teeth  It would feel a shooting pain even brushing my tooth with my electric tooth brush it would send a shooting pain. - I went back to the dentist he couldn't see anything wrong with the tooth and said wait a few days just see if it settles down. \n\nA few days passed and I still had this pain, I went back to the dentist she then removed the filling and looked in my tooth and said \"Yes its definitely this tooth\" (it must of inflamed) , The dentist then cleaned my tooth and put a temporary filling in and advised booking another appointment for a root Canal.\n\nOver the Christmas  holiday with this temporary filling I felt NO pain at all I could do anything to the tooth and it felt great, Biting / brushing . It was Perfect !  I have no idea why my tooth seemed fine maybe their something wrong with the previous filling?  and after removing it , cleaning the tooth putting a temporary filling in what ever had happened solved my  horrendous tooth ache I had NO pain for for over 3 weeks. Maybe it was my Extraction that was causing the pain during the healing period? I have no idea.\n\nToday I went back the dentist for Root Canal and explained this, he basically advised he will have a look at the tooth after taking away the temporary filling and he agreed with the other dentist that I needed to have a root canal. He said the pain will come back if I don't. and I increase the risk of another extraction  So I ended up with a root canal.\n\nI am asking my self a question if I really needed a root canal when the problem had seemed to have gone away?

    "title": "Need help with my implant abutment failure",
    "dialogue": "swampwiz: Background:  In 2005. right before Hurricane Katrina struck, for a lower #5 (I have the genetic condition that seems to be popular in that that permanent tooth never exists, and when I hit age 40 the baby tooth had to go) I got an oral surgeon to implant a Zimmer 4.7 Tapered Screw-Vent Implant with a 4.5mmd restorative platform.  And as I had mentioned Hurricane Katrina, of course it is very pertinent to my situation as the oral surgeon's records were completely destroyed in that.  I was living abroad in Ukraine after that and got the crown put in, and believe that the crown was from Israel.  I would presume that it was a Zimmer abutment, but who knows?\n\nSo fast-forward to today and my crown now has a range of motion of a rotation of about 30 degrees or so, but it seems to not have any range up or down.  My current dentist drilled at the top to get to the screw and when she tightened the screw, the crown ended up being rotated at one of the ends of that range, but unfortunately, that position has the tooth at about 20 degrees out of line.  I had been told by my current, and another, dentist that the abutment is shot.  Both the implant surgeon colleague of my current dentist and the original implanter said that they have never encountered a situation like this.\n\nOK, so I need a new abutment from Zimmer.  (BTW, it was like - pun semi-intended - pulling teeth to get someone from Zimmer to talk to me because I am just a stupid patient).  I had an X-ray that shows the abutment that I had sent to Zimmer for them to tell me exactly what I had (they had addressed me as \"Dr.\" and originally clammed up after I had informed them that I was the patient, although it seems that finally I have a manager who will speak to me!).  After I relayed this to my dentist, she (actually the office manager of her dental practice, which is a large dental care organization) told me that she also needed the the reference # or the size of the healing abutment.  When I had relayed this to the Zimmer representative that had identified by implant, she said that my dentist has all the information that she needed.  So I figured that I needed to mediate between these 2 parties to continue on with my care.\n\nAnyway, so I finally got to talk to someone at Zimmer that respected my concern as a patient and she said that there are many choices about what can be done.  For the new healing abutment - which would be there while the crown gets manufactured - it seems that are 2 independent selections: the height and the flarity.  AETM, the height must be determined by the dentist using a perioprobe, and the flarity - which can be either 4.5 (cylindrical) or 5.5 (conical frustrum) mm depends on the condition of my gum there.  My question here is is that something can be determined without breaking the crown off?  The whole idea of the healing abutment is that it be there when the crown is broken, so it there seems to be a chicken & egg dilemma; perhaps my dentist should order both and figure out which one is needed, and then send the unneeded one back?\n\nAnd as for the permanent abutment, it seems that I have 4 choices:\n\n[1] screw-retained crown with UCLA abutment, in which there is only 1 screw used\n\n[2] screw-retained crown with a tapered abutment which itself is screwed into the implant insert, and thus there being 2 screws\n\n[3] cementable crown with a hex-lock abutment\n\n[4] cementable crown UCLA abutment\n\nMy first question about this is which of these sounds like what I have now.  The second one is what are the pros & cons of each type, both in durability & $$$.  I have been told that I have a strong bite, if that matters.\n\nAnd of course, I would welcome any advice about my situation.  Thanks"

    "dialogue": "Anon_DA: Hi all, I am new here and I am just looking for some advice.\n\nI should start by saying that as a kid, I never really had the best dental hygiene! \n\nI had a filling as a child, and after a couple of years it was no longer sealed - so liquid started to get behind it etc. Obviously add that to poor dental hygiene at the time it became infected. (Out of curiosity can a filling that is no longer fully sealed give you an infection on its own? Or would it be linked with the poor dental hygiene only? Or both?\n\nIt became VERY painful so I went to see the dentist, I was told that the tooth would need to be removed surgically and could not just be pulled out. In the meantime he said he could not give me anything to release the pain due to the infection, but he would need to remove the filling. So with no pain relief, it was removed. Wow!! I have never been in so much pain!! A few weeks later the tooth was removed while i was put to sleep....\n\nSince then I have always been very nervous of the dentist, particularly when they are poking around and the drill used...\n\nI try to look after my teeth now, brushing 2 times daily, flossing etc.....\n\nA couple of months ago I went for a routine checkup and was told I would need a filling. I went back, had the injection to numb the area and he started drilling away. Based on the time taken I think he went pretty deep removing pretty much all the center of my tooth, and I could feel it, it was kinda painful but not unbearable, is this normal with a deep filling even after injection? This brought back memories and I was very uneasy during the process.....\n\nSo it's been a couple of months since I had my filling on one of my back teeth, but every time I eat over it, anything hard, it hurts.... Like a sharp pain, but I can brush it, chew soft food etc and it is not a problem, but if I catch anything hard on it, it is a sharp pain but goes away instantly when I release my chew....if that makes sense?\n\nSo today, I drank orange juice and when the juice went over the tooth it stung....not had this before, could this indicate that the seal is broken? As I am writing this it feels fine, but should I go and see a dentist? Does any or all of this sound normal? \n\nLike I said, the filling was deep, but not sure if this is normal now....\n\nI have attached a picture, like I said, as a child I had poor dental hygiene and I am paying for that slightly now  But I do try to look after them a lot more (24 years old now).....\n\nI am so nervous about going to the dentist so do not want to do it when I don't need to... I always go for my checkups though every 6 months  \n\nDoes the picture show any signs or worry for anyone in the know? The filling was done on the one in front of the very back tooth, you can see the different colour.... \n\nAdvice, anything to put me at easy etc would be so much appreciated  \n\nThanks in advance!!"

It is very clear to anyone who looks that the bridge needs replacing asap and is hanging off. Can anyone give me any help or advice, or a quote as to the price of a replacement. Nikolai Fesenko: Unfortunately, the dental bridge is not a long-lasting variant for teeth replacement. To install dental bridge it is necessary to grind off the holding teeth and to remove nerves from them, in other words, to kill healthy teeth. And such teeth after 5-10 years can be completely destroyed, as the pressure while chewing is up to them. Now it will be necessary to install dental implants instead of the dental bridge.

My diet isn't that bad but I do drink far too much beer, which may be the culprit. So my question is there any way I can still get white composite for these deep fillings?\n\nMy concerns are mercury poisoning, whether or not mercury calcifies the pineal gland (probably woo) and most importantly, the fact that they look ugly. If amalgam is completely unavoidable, is there at least some form of white coating that can be painted over it? I imagine this question has been asked on here ad nauseum, so apologies in advance.\n\nAdvice much appreciated. Thanks! GainzCentral: BUMP Plaza Dental Group: Amalgam, composite, porcelain and or gold have been common materials to fill holes or cavities in teeth. Dental amalgam is used to repair cavities caused by tooth decay. Dentists say it is the strongest, cheapest and longest-lasting filling in the business. Nice sharing."

I am not a fan of \"same day\" crowns for many reasons. Most people find that \"porcelain fused to metal (PFM)\" crowns are excellent all-around and they are typically around $1k or less. The cheapest alternative to any higher end crown is a \"stainless steel\" crown which should be about half that. But I would avoid them unless you had no choice. JJ_8613: Thank you for the information.  I'm going to call around to offices in my area to see what other places charge. JJ_8613: Hi all.\n\nJust a quick update.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I got a temporary crown for my fractured tooth.  It's a ceramic crown and cost around $800.  Still a lot of money, but much more affordable.

That doesn't include the temp crown (I believe was $400), which I have right now. Good luck to you. Zuri Barniv: There is a big difference between a regular tooth crown and a crown for an implant. $1,800 for an implant crown is reasonable but that is a ridiculous fee for a regular tooth crown.

Went to dentist today because my surgeon \"missed\" that I had a severe caries on tooth 47, and an advancing one on tooth 37.\n\nI have had practically no pain whatsoever. but as she said to restore that tooth as soon as possible, I went to the dentist today.\n\nWell now it hurts like HELL. On a scale from 1 to 10 I would say about 8.0, maybe even 8.5 and I have a high tolerance for pain.\n\nThe toot I got \"fixed\" today was tooth no. 47. I have severe pain on my right side of the face, though I am not entirely sure, if the tooth in question hurts, as it seems that the entire part of that side hurts, but I even believe that the pain is even on the upper jaw, not lower one.\n\nI am uploading the x-ray photo, taken relatively recently, right about the time after the surgery.\n\nPlease help.\n\nThank you! AF05: You had a BSSO surgery recently but there is no plates or screws on the lower jaw?  Second, it takes weeks for the swelling to go away; thus, the pain you are having could be a combination from opening your mouth during the procedure and from the actually deep cavity ( assuming we are talking about tooth #31/ Lower Right second molar) and the tooth could be in need for root canal treatment.   I hope things get better.  AF05 maekos112: Thank you for replying! I had taken some pain meds yesterday, and the pain went away. It's not present today anymore.\n\nIndeed, this x-ray was taken one day before the surgery (just checked the date). \n\nI believe that most of my teeth need fixing? All the ones that are slightly whiter, correct? AF05: Maekos-\n\nI am happy to hear that your are feeling better.  \n\nI am no clear on the notion you mentioned \"All the ones that are slightly whiter\"    The way you decay/ cavity on teeth detected is though dental exam and x-rays: however, typical panoramic pictures are not a good measure of decay on teeth unless it's large (e.g the Lower Right first tooth from the back has a big cavity.  Furthermore, you have braces on your teeth and that will block the view of the x-ray to show the teeth completely.  \n\nFinally, I hope you don't need a root canal treatment on lower right side as it look on the x-ray that it could.  Regards,\n AF04\n\np.S what are you taking for pain meds? maekos112: I am not very familiar with dentistry. \n\nI think I may need root canal treatment, but first I need to be able to open my mouth enough so my dentist can get access to the tooth in the first place.\n\nI appreciate your help and replies!\n\nP.S.: I took paracetamol for the pain AF05: Best of Luck and fast recovery.

    "title": "Bad filling",
    "dialogue": "Tman: Hello all,\n\nOnce again I've come away from an NHS UK dentist feeling let down.\n\nFirst of all I'll point out that the dentist I saw, did not take the time to check all of my teeth as I'd requested and paid for.  The 'scale and polish,' included in 'Band 2,' of the care I received involved cleaning the inside of my front lower teeth, and nothing else.  I understand that a dentist must inspect all of the teeth, and advise whether a hygienist is required.  I'll be complaining about this.\n\nThe filling itself was for a cavitie that had developed on a molar where the gum had receded.  He applied fillings to two other teeth, at the gum line.  \n   I have had this type of filling before on the other side of my mouth, and the previous dentist made a very subtle, barely noticeable filling just above the gum.  With the new fillings I've had today, the composite has been smeared on to the enamel above the gum, so 70% of the side of my tooth has been covered with composite.  It was a healthy part of my tooth, so I don't know why he covered it.  When I touch it with my tongue, what was smooth healthy enamel is now rough with composite.  \n\nI'm going to another dentist to hopefully get this corrected.  Can the excess composite be removed so that the outer surface of the tooth is enamel as opposed to composite? Dr David Lee: Hello Tman,\n\nExcess composite can be removed if it has been placed over the enamel.\nThe composite can also be polished using a variety of burs or polishing discs to try to make it as smooth as possible.\n\nHope that answers your question! Tman: Dr David Lee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHello Tman,\n\nExcess composite can be removed if it has been placed over the enamel.\nThe composite can also be polished using a variety of burs or polishing discs to try to make it as smooth as possible.\n\nHope that answers your question!\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\n\n\nThank you for reply.  I have since then been to the dentist.  He has removed some of the composite, but says he can't remove all of it as that would risk removing enamel.  I still have excess composite going into the inside of my mouth and the tooth is rough and lumpy when I touch it with my tongue.   Also, a part of my tooth where the composite has recently been scraped off by the dentist, is sensitive when I gently scrape it with my nail.  Is it possible that he took away some enamel?  \n\nAny advice and comments would be greatly appreciated. Dr David Lee: Tman said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThank you for reply.

The root surfaces of the teeth are the most common cause of sensitive teeth.\n\nThe dentist should be able to remove composite without removing enamel as the composite filling is placed over the enamel and can be differentiated.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to ask anymore questions. If in doubt, you can always ask for a second opinion from another dentist."

I showed these to my dentist and he didn't seem too concerned and told me they are just part of the wear and tear of the teeth. One of my top teeth also has a slight dent in it, as if the enamel has been chipped off, meaning the dentin is exposed. I haven't experienced any sensitivity. My dentist didn't notice/point it out. \n\nHowever, I am wondering, is the dentin strong? Can it be left exposed and be perfectly durable? I touch the dented area quite a lot to analyse it, I don't know if touching/scratching my nail across it could damage it more, or if its strong enough to withstand eating, touching etc. Should i bring it up again with concerns or is it fine as I am not experiencing sensitivity? I don't know if its normal for dentin to be exposed and not be seen as a concern if there is no sensitivity.\n\nThanks in advance!"

All three were right next to each other starting from the second to the back right side, and the two after that. The one furthest back feels like it's stuck to the one in front of it, It literally feels all smooth in between the two like they were welded together. There's also what feels like spatter all over the sides of my teeth, like he didn't clean them up very well. I understand it's probably a simple mistake and probably easily fixable but I also noticed that he was fumbling with his tools the whole time and when he sat down I could clearly smell vodka coming from him. I'm wondering what my best course of action should be, should I go to a different dentist and see if they can just fix it and go to them from now on and forget it, or if I might have a case against him to file a lawsuit? Thanks guys. Dr David Lee: Hi Damian2130,\n\nWhen you talk about fillings, you are right that they should each be their own distinct tooth so that you can floss between them. Are you able to get floss in between the teeth?\n\nSometimes, fillings need revisions because it is not possible to get them to the exact comfortable position the first time when you are numb.  Adjustments can be made at future appointments to get it right. \n\nThe best thing is to not jump to any conclusions. If you have any particular concerns, it is best to speak to the office or dentist to see if there is any way they can help."

He said there's no much else he can do short of a RCT, but he said i can either get that or just put up with the discomfort as he thinks the crown will support the tooth. The discomfort i can put up with (it's not terrible). However he said my bite is no good and that it is causing my molars to crack. He said the molar above my crowned molar is also \"looking bad\" and the crown is only buying time. \n\nSo he suggested i get braces which will (apparently) fix my bite and change the pressure points on my molars. Is he correct? Also will the white braces work just as well (I'm quite vain, not sure i want those all-steel braces) PlacidWay-US: Hi @Bob22 if your dentist told you to wear braces please do so and you can also asses yourself if you really have a bad bite. About your concern on wearing braces you can have this invisalign, it is a clear plastic mold that aligns the teeth without the use of braces. This far too good compared to the traditional braces which makes use of metal."

As advised by multiple dentists, the tooth was extracted by a very experienced periodontist and an implant was put in place. I wore a temporary flipper while it healed. My periodontist gave me the ok to load the implant after 3 months, but for insurance purposes I waited 6 months.

My dentist (who is young but reputable and specializes in cosmetic dentistry) and the dental assistant attached the final abutment, crown, and veneer. I was pretty satisfied with the cosmetic result.\n\nIt has now been 1 month. Two days ago, after flossing I noticed that the crown was loose. I was able to move it about 1mm front and back as well as side to side. I immediately called my dentist and went in the next day. After taking an x-ray and looking at it, she told me that it was either that the abutment screw was loose (most likely) or that the implant itself is loose.

The abutment screw is loose. This can happen if it is undertightened when the abutment is fitted. Your dentist should have used a torque wrench or torque driver to tighten it to the recommended value. Alternatively the implant may have been overloaded. This can happen if the implant tooth or the implant itself is placed 'out of harmony' with your bite relationship. If the crown has been cemented over the implant abutment, there is no way to access the screw without cutting through the back of the crown. This will unfortunately render the crown weak and liable to fail at some later date. Your dentist should do all this remedial work at no cost -  including making a new crown. You are protected by the Sale Goods and Services Act which states that any item bought must be fit for purpose and of reasonable quality. Don't be persuaded otherwise.\n2. The implant may have failed although this is less likely given the amount of time that has passed. An Xray will generally indicate a failed implant and removing the crown will confirm it.\nThere is little redress if the implant has failed as this is a recognised risk and you gave informed consent. Were you fully informed verbally and in writing? Did you sign a consent form? If not, you will have grounds for full redress and/or a complaint to the GDC.\nI would advise you to talk to your dentist and allow him to rectify the situation. If it happens again, ask for your money back and find a better dentist."

The Doctor ended up filling 4 teeth #15, 14, 13, and 12. #14 was the reason I went in. When I left I had horrible pain, still in #14. I relate it to dry socket pain just less intense. It will last until I take Ibuprofen (400-800mg). Then it disappears for 8-24 hours. Literally pain free. However, when it returns it's the same dry socket type pain (less intense) and lasts for about 15-30 minutes. I feel certain the pain is in #14. However, I also have pain just above #14 where I am certain the novacaine was injected. So this was scaring me and I went back. The doctor decided to refill #14 and #15. Nothing changed. Today March 18th I still feel the same. I have an appointment scheduled for this Sunday  however, I really don't want to go back again. My concern now is that they continue making the wrong decision. a) They pull it when it was just bruising or b) they see the bruise and say it's just the bruise and it turns out to be the tooth. I feel like I have several more visits coming up for this incident. When the pain comes I try to focus where the pain is but when I feel certain it's from the tooth I rub my cheek and it starts feeling better. Oh, and besides the 2 fillings I went 2 other times to adjust the bite. Even the dentist checked the bite and said there was no contact. I kept telling the dental assistant that I feel contact and she was clearly become frustrated with me. She even paused at one point for 20 seconds just thinking. I feel the pain right now as I am typing this. It is so difficult to know if it's the tooth, the bruise, or both. I attached a picture. Any advice? hearsay: Update: I went today. I just want to get this over with. They ended up telling me they don't know. The doctor didn't even see me just his assistant. She said that she would check my bite one more time. Then tapped my tooth with her tool. I didn't hurt at first but over the next several minutes it starting radiating. It's either the bruising or the nerve. I still don't know but am scheduled to have it pulled tomorrow morning. Who knows. But I will be glad to see this tooth go. I have developed a hatred towards this tooth. It has been bothering me for 18 days. hearsay: update: Now it doesn't hurt at all for the past 8 hours with no ibuprofen. I'm scheduled to pull it in the morning, but I have no pain at the moment.

About 7 years ago, my well-respected dentist recommended that I replace four front lower teeth, that were slightly crooked, with a bridge. Well, this was the worst mistake I ever made and, in my opinion, downright negligent. He destroyed 4 perfectly good teeth for a quick fix and a nice profit. I am currently in the process of finishing a dental implant on a front upper tooth....this 1 tooth is costing me $7000+.....so that makes my bridge error even more disturbing. I hate the bridge. It feels like a foreign object in my mouth and it looks too perfect/fake. I found a \"best of\" prosthodontist (in another, larger city) to do the crown for my current implant. I want to give myself the best chance at a positive result, after my previous huge mistake. The question now is, do I replace the 4 bottom teeth that were destroyed, in order to rid myself of this bridge. I'm 57 years old. I take excellent care of myself and don't want to think of living with this bridge, for the rest of my life. The cost, however, is $10,000+. I have researched some of the downsides of even having a bridge....jaw bone loss, etc. But, I am also concerned about making another very costly mistake. Will the crowns hold up? Will one be likely to fall off at the most inopportune time? Will the result look as I want it to and will the replaced teeth feel 100% natural vs this bridge?

I am currently in the process of finishing a dental implant on a front upper tooth....this 1 tooth is costing me $7000+.....so that makes my bridge error even more disturbing. I hate the bridge. It feels like a foreign object in my mouth and it looks too perfect/fake. I found a \"best of\" prosthodontist (in another, larger city) to do the crown for my current implant. I want to give myself the best chance at a positive result, after my previous huge mistake. The question now is, do I replace the 4 bottom teeth that were destroyed, in order to rid myself of this bridge. I'm 57 years old. I take excellent care of myself and don't want to think of living with this bridge, for the rest of my life. The cost, however, is $10,000+. I have researched some of the downsides of even having a bridge....jaw bone loss, etc. But, I am also concerned about making another very costly mistake. Will the crowns hold up? Will one be likely to fall off at the most inopportune time? Will the result look as I want it to and will the replaced teeth feel 100% natural vs this bridge? If anyone has advice, experience or thoughts on this type of replacement, I would greatly value your feedback. Thanks so much!\n\t\t\nClick to expand... kelly123: I hear your pain both health-wise and financially. I have crowns on nearly every tooth as well as a bridge for one side and an implant bridge (love it) for another side. I am having problems with tooth #7. If you can afford it, implants are the way to go since you are only in your 50's. Bridges can look great but they depend on the \"neighbor teeth\" for support. My mom just had one done for 4 missing front teeth. It looks great but I wonder what will happen if/when those canines fail. As you know, the nerve in them sometimes dies when they are prepped for a bridge. The problem with implants is the number of appointments needed to finally get them.\n  If the aesthetics effects your daily living, you need to change it or accept it. I am a little vain and would change it. Best wishes! Mamakin: Thanks kelly123. Appreciate the feedback and well-wishes. Yes, an implant is quite an undertaking.  Certainly not a quick fix. This is my 2nd. Lots to consider, regarding the front 4 lower teeth! PlacidWay-US: @Mamakin I assume you're after a quick fix? But I think considering implants even if it may take time is the best option. As you said you just wasted money and it's because you're after for quick result, So i'm suggesting that since you will be spending money then go for a durable and long lasting result where dental implants can provide. But to give you an insight of the time you need to spend for the procedure.  The implant site is allowed to heal before the new artificial tooth is attached. This procedure may take from three to six months to heal. After that time period, your dentist will complete the procedure by placing a crown restoration. The healing process will depend on many factors such as your jawbone structure, age, and general oral health. But still the decision is yours, and having it done abroad just consider Mexico or Costa Rica you may find the cost of implants there more convincing. Good luck!"

    "dialogue": "rokkdp: New dental implant does not look exactly like a tooth.  There is a gap between the cusp and the gum line.  From the cusp, the crown curves inwards toward the gum line.  So it is kind of like the tooth top is there, but tapers towards the gum line.  Almost like it was not made correctly to meet up with gum and look natural.\nWas this done correctly or should I look to have it replaced.  It is in the back, so not noticeable.  But I'm concerned with food getting trapped between implant crown and the gum.  \nThe implant is the #14 (I think) - second tooth in from back. DanyRoden: I think you have to tell this your dentist. PlacidWay-US: It looks bad! I agree with @DanyRoden, better go back to your dental implant surgeon. Implants should be placed as if it's natural teeth. In your case the gap is really noticesable and it may really affect the neighboring teeth as the food that trapped there can cause tooth decay. Where you had your implants? and what type of implants you dentist used?"

    "title": "Metal post material broke after a year?",
    "dialogue": "pippyl94: Hello,\n\nMy adventure with crowns started in 2005ish.  At that time, I had a tooth extracted due to an abscess (#13).  Not too long after, I had one of my front incisors extracted due to an accident that left it broken at the gum line.  The dentist at the time decided the best option was to make a 7 tooth bridge from the incisor next to the broken tooth back to my molar behind the extracted #13.  This cost $16,000 for just this round (thankfully my kind and amazing grandmother offered to take care of the cost).  This was only the beginning.\nI moved out of the state, and a few years later started having some pain in #14 at the end of the bridge.  I had it checked by the dentist here who determined that tooth would need to be pulled as well, meaning that long bridge would need to come apart.  They asked me if I would like to have the long bridge again, which I said no to because I then had to pay again to have all of those crowns replaced (again) after this round if anything would go wrong with any of the teeth. This would be the second round of crowns on all of these teeth already.\nAfter many appointments I finally had the crowns finished, now with individual crowns in the front ( the one missing now with an implant) and a four tooth bridge to cover 13 and 14 that were extracted.  \nHere is where my issue comes in:  when the prosthodontist put the final crowns in, he seemed to have a lot of trouble getting them to stay and was getting frustrated. They kept falling out, especially #8, but also #7.  He kept trying to make them stay in and pushing on them.  For the next week my mouth was VERY painful right above that tooth, with stabbing and throbbing pain.  I had never had that happen with other crowns.  It finally faded and I thought everything was fine, until maybe a month or two later. \nI then noticed a small painless bump on my gum above #8.  I didn't think it was anything much at first, but kept an eye on it.  It got slightly bigger, but then it started leaking something and went back down.  My degrees are not in the medical/dental field.... I initially thought it was one of those little bumps that happen it your mouth once in a while, BUT it then filled back up with fluid.  I called the dentist and asked them to take a look at it to see if it was dental related. They made an appointment for an apicoectomy, which was about three months after I had all of the crowns put on.  It continued to repeatedly fill with fluid and drain until the appointment.\nIn the next year, my husband got laid off and we lost our insurance.  A year after all of the crowns were placed, that same #8 came out.  I called my dentist, but they informed me they would not be able to take me due to being on state insurance, even if I paid the full price out of pocket.  Not even for a consult, which normally they offer for free.  I went to the local community center, where they glued it back in.  It would continue to come out several times in the next couple of years, while my husbands insurance went in and out- he continued to get laid off repeatedly.  The community center glued it back in four times it total, and I have glued it back in countless times.  Sometimes daily.  The last time the community center glued it back in, she drilled some of the crown off for space because apparently my bottom tooth was hitting it on the inside of my mouth, pushing it forward and causing it to repeatedly come off.  The metal post actually broke, with part of it stuck in the crown and the other half in my mouth.  I'm guessing this was from the bottom tooth repeatedly causing force on it.\nMy husband's work has finally called him back long enough now for my old dental group who performed the work to accept me back with the insurance. I went for a consult with the oral surgeon, who confirmed my hunch that by now I will need another implant.  It has been worked on so much now that there is absolutely no tooth left to be seen on what was originally a full tooth.  Before I could ask him, he mentioned he was going to ask about getting a reduced fee since it happened so soon.\nI then also had a consult with the prosthodontist who had placed the crowns.  He looked confused when he saw the broken post and said that the cost might even be more than the estimate they had given me (about $4200).\nI now have an essix in and have an appointment for  extraction/bone graft/implant coming up.  The receptionist informed me that the manager states they can't offer any money off.  Her reason is that they did not originally perform the first root canal.  I do not understand what that has to do with the metal material breaking in two pieces most likely due to being hit by my bottom tooth???  \nIn addition, now that they new year has started, the cost will be at least a few hundred more than the estimate, of course.\nUltimately, right now I am extremely frustrated.  I now have over $30,000 in my mouth- soon to be about $35,000.  I am only 33 years old!  There is now not much left under these crowns.  Contrary to the somewhat offending comments/assumptions made by my dental group regarding oral hygiene and my health, I brush twice a day or more, floss AT LEAST once a day, use my water pic, and I must have mouth wash!   The first dentist I went to suggested that my first born absorbed all of the calcium from my teeth.  I hound my husband constantly to floss his teeth- which he does NOT...gross- yet his look perfect (for the time being...we'll see), yet I have so many issues.  I eat healthy- vegetarian- and avoid hard/sticky candies.  It's truly irritating and has been causing many tears and anxiety.  I have three children and I would much rather pour all of this money into activities/education for them.  At this point I am tired of always being at the dentist and ready to get an upper plate.   I mentioned this to the oral surgeon and he stated it wouldn't be worth it because I would have to get the remaining teeth extracted. Right now I have 10 remaining on top, but I was consulted last year that #3 is close to needing an implant as well if the crown comes off again.\nI apologize for how long this is.  I am new to this forum and do not know how long the posts typically are.  I really appreciate anyone who has read this far.  To sum it up, my questions are:\nWhat does the root canal have to do with the metal material breaking in two pieces due to being hit by my bottom tooth?  I honestly do not remember who performed the initial root canal.  I am guessing it was the first round in 2005, but they are no longer in operation to get records.\nWhy did it hurt after he couldn't get it to fit?  What specifically caused the pain/ bump on my gum after this?\nHow often and how soon do metal posts usually break in two pieces like this?\nShould I consider getting a top plate soon (remembering also that if either tooth on the end of that four tooth bridge fails I will most likely be needing 3 or 4 more impants/ bone grafts,etc)?\nShould I consider having this done by someone else?  I worry that it will not look the same as the others crowns in front.  I am also worried about my husband getting laid off again. It is finally a long enough time period to get all of this taken care of (4-6 months).\nIs it unusual that they are not willing to work with me on the cost, given the time period and what happened?\nPlease help me expand my knowledge on this!\nThank you in advance!"

    "dialogue": "Susan M: Three crowns were done(14,19,31) using crown porcelain fused to high noble metal D2750 and core buildup D2950. For $150 each, the dentist suggested I upgrade to crowns with added porcelain, so there would be no black line on my gum line in the future. On his advice I agreed. When I  got the insurance paperwork I noticed there was a charge on all 3 crowns for pulp cap direct D3110. Nothing was ever said to me about the pulp cap direct, so when I questioned it, his office insurance lady said that the insurance takes care of that, and whatever they don't take care of she will write that portion off at no cost to me. Two months after getting crown 31 it fell off. To my surprise it was a  very very small partial crown. I questioned why I paid for an upgrade when there was no gum line involved, since it was such a small crown. The insurance lady told me the crown was all porcelain and the metal would have shown, if the upgrade hadn't been done. I also asked why there needed to be a build up and why it needed pulp cap direct. She told me he had to build up the tooth and the root was almost exposed which does not make sense to me. The dentist re cemented the crown and charged my insurance company, but did not charge me. I would appreciate your feedback on my issues. Thank you so much for your time. Zuri Barniv: We are only getting one side of the story, which is never fair. But if your version is accurate, it sounds like your dentist is billing the insurance for services not rendered and then \"writing off\" your portion so you don't complain. I would contact your insurance company and let them know your concerns and consider finding a more ethical dentist. Susan M: I truly appreciate you responding to my post. Because of you writing, getting one side of the story is never fair, I emailed the office insurance lady exactly what I posted and added this:\n\nThe above statement has been reviewed by two dentists.\nThe first dentist gave us his opinion if the above is accurate, but he also wrote the following:\nWe are only getting one side of the story, which is never fair.\nThe second dentist also gave his opinion if the above is accurate and wrote us the following:\nI'm an accredited cosmetic dentist who saw a lot of appearance-conscious patients, and I never did porcelain margins or anything like that for esthetic purposes on lower molars, and two of these teeth you reported to me were lower molars. One was a second molar. Even if there were a black line there, no one would ever see it.\n\nWithin 15 minutes the dentist called us on the phone. He explained to my wife and me that he did not say anything about the pulp cap directs because he only charges the insurance and not the patient. Just to make sure we understood my wife restated, \"So you didn't say anything about the pulp direct because there would be no charge to us\", and he said that was correct. Regarding the $150 upgrade he said he did EMAX crowns which are all porcelain without any metal. We told him my wife recently had EMAX crowns done by a different dentist, and that dentist charged the insurance company D2740 without any upgrade fee. He said there is no code for EMAX crowns. Several times in the conversation he mentioned all charges were legal. I asked him to respond in writing what he told us in this conversation and he said he would. Once again I would appreciate your remarks.Thank you for the time you are spending on this. Zuri Barniv: So if I understand correctly, the dentist charged your insurance for a service he did not actually do (a pulp cap)? Did I get that right? He felt that since he only charged the insurance and not you, that would be ok. If true, that would be considered insurance fraud. Please check this site: http://www.insurancefraud.org/scam-alerts-dental.htm\n\nAs for D2740, that is an ADA Code for an all ceramic crown (including EMAX and Zirconium crowns), so there is nothing to \"upgrade\" to. It already is not supposed to have any metal in it. Some insurance policies do not cover this code and they will \"downgrade\" D2740 to a lower code such as an all-metal crown or similar. They will pay less for this and expect the dentist to accept that lower fee if the dentist is contracted with the insurance company. So some dentists anticipate that and bill the insurance for the \"cheaper\" crown they know they will pay for and then charge you more to \"upgrade\" it. There are too many variables here to discuss it all on this site, so there could be other issues at play that I'm not aware of.

Susan M: Sorry I was not clear, but the dentist told me he did the three pulp caps, but when he did them he never informed me that he was doing them. He told me the reason he didn't inform me was because he said he would accept only what the insurance company paid, and I would not have to pay anything. I then explained to him that my secondary insurance had a $1300 calendar maximum  and because I eventually went over the $1300, the $39 paid by the secondary insurance company for the first pulp cap actually took away from other covered procedures that I had to pay for. The other two pulp caps he charged my primary insurance company, but when he charged my secondary insurance it was declined because I had reached my $1300 maximum. The dentist did not charge me for the remaining balance on the other two pulp caps.\nAs far as the upgrade, which  I questioned because it made no sense to me, he started talking about the upgraded crown being a better material. I really wasn't understanding his explanation, so that is when I asked him to respond to my email in writing about everything we had discussed. I am waiting for his written response.\nOnce again I cannot express to you how much I appreciate your time with this matter. Zuri Barniv: Susan, I can count the number of times I needed to do a pulp cap in the last 15 yrs on a patient on one hand. A cavity has to be extremely deep to get to that point and in most cases, the teeth are exquisitely sensitive afterwards. This is why many pulp caps ultimately end up as a root canal. The chance 3 teeth in a row needed pulp caps is so remote that I would really recommend you show the x-rays to another dentist for a second opinion. The dentist may be fluffing his bottom line by saying he did this procedure and didn't actually do it. I don't have the x-rays and all the details, so can't say for sure. But my Spidey-senses are tingling with this one. Be wary. I am also concerned he immediately said, \"all charges were legal\". Think about why someone would say something like that??\n\nAnd always be cautious when any dentist does a bunch of unplanned procedures and then doesn't mention them to you even though there was theoretically a co-payment due. I also always caution folks to be extra careful when dentists waive co-pays in general. They are making their money in other ways, which may not be to your advantage.\nDr. Barniv Susan M: Just to clarify I, Susan, have been writing the messages for my husband with his assistance.  Dr. Barniv, we also want you to know the following (crown 31 was replaced in September) was never mentioned to you, but it was included in the email we sent to the dentist's office.\n\nThe following was included in the first and only email we sent to the dentist's office insurance lady:\n  (her name), because of the first dentist telling us it is not fair to get only one side of the story, I am asking you to read over what  we have written and explain to us if there is anything you do not feel is accurate. We realize we did not include the fact that crown 31 was replaced with no charge in September. We appreciate that this was done, but it was not included because we do not feel it was relevant to what had taken place before it was done. \n\nTonight I received the dentist's response to our email. He said he recommended emax crowns because of strength and esthetic qualities. He also stated he had to build up the teeth to ensure proper substructure for the crowns. He placed the liner in order to protect the pulp as it was very close to the defect. On #31 he said originally he did a conservative restoration as a partial crown to preserve as much tooth structure as possible. Unfortunately the partial crown didn't stay on due to its smaller surface area. He then converted it to a full coverage crown. \n.\nNothing was mentioned in his email about not informing that the pulp caps were being done.\n\nThese are our questions. 1) If he did emax crowns should have he coded them as D2740 and not charged us an upgrade? We can't figure out why he coded them as porcelain fused high metal D2750, when according to him there was no metal. 2) If 31 was conservative, only covering the top of the tooth (when it fell out we saw how small it was), how could have the pulp been involved? 3) Is it customary for a dentist to do pulp caps without informing the patient?  4) Because of the pulp caps and crown build ups have according to the dentist already been done, is there any way of knowing if they were actually done? \n\n We are totally aware that we know nothing about dentistry, so one more time we greatly appreciate your time. Zuri Barniv: 1. I recommend you double check with your insurance to answer this questions, because I am no insurance expert. But my initial response is \"yes\", if he did an E-Max crown, he should have coded it D2740, not a PFM + upgrade.\n2. It is unlikely the pulp was involved as you point out. As I said, when a pulp cap is done, the patient usually \"knows it\" as the tooth can be extremely sensitive for a while and there is a decent statistical chance it will subsequently need a root canal. Also, this is called an \"inlay\" which is coded differently and is less expensive.\n3. No - a dentist should ALWAYS tell you about every procedure he is performing on you. Just because it is \"needed\" or not charged to you is not an excuse. You have an absolute right to know what is happening to your body. \n4. Possibly. The easy way is to take an x-ray of what you have now. Since it is an E-Max crown, the x-rays penetrate the material and you can more-or-less see how deep the underlying material is. It is not perfect, but gives you some idea. \n\nMy questions to you are: Are you planning to stay with this dentist once this gets sorted out? Are you planning to find a new dentist regardless of the outcome? Your inquires, discussions, phone calls, etc. will take a lot of your precious time and energy to sort out. In the end your teeth will be unchanged. So think about what you want to accomplish before going into battle.\n\n\"We are totally aware that we know nothing about dentistry, so one more time we greatly appreciate your time.\"\nMy pleasure, and you are not expected to know anything about dentistry. This is why it is important to have mutual trust with your dentist, doctor or whomever takes care of you and your family. Susan M: Dr. Barniv,\n\nI have contacted both insurance companies regarding the D2750 vs D2740 coding. If they determine we should not have been charged the $150 upgrade, our goal is to recover that money.\n\nThe reasons we chose this dentist was because his ratings on yelp were EXCELLENT. Also he was a graduate from a private highly prestigious dental school in southern California, where he served as a clinical instructor. I will not mention the school's name. He is currently serving as an Assistant Professor at a different college of dental medicine.\n\nLast year I also had a crown done by this dentist. I was charged the $150 upgrade, plus a core build up. In addition I had a composite filling and was charged $10 for a composite sealant. Fortunately I was NOT charged for a pulp cap direct. When my husband's #31 crown fell off it really scared me, because I was going to have this dentist put crowns on my worn and chipped front teeth. At that point I changed to another dentist who was highly recommended by several friends.\n\nOver 30 years ago my dentist (retired) accidentally filled my wrong tooth because the xrays were reversed by his dental assistant. He called me immediately to inform me and took full responsibility. Being human I know we all make mistakes, and I admired his honesty so he remained my dentist until his retirement. I am telling you this because we are not the type of people that are out to harm anyone. But this whole situation is beyond our comprehension. We truly hope and pray that everything the dentist in question has done was legitimate. We are extremely disturbed by the fact that he did not inform my husband of the three pulp caps. We are beginning to question everything. At this point we wonder if anything he did was actually necessary. Probably our main question now is this. Is anything he did or did not do going to be harmful to our teeth in the future?\n\nLastly, my husband is not going back to him. And of course, as always, thank you so much for your time.\n\nSusan Zuri Barniv: I cringe when I hear about \"upgrades\" as these are almost always designed to separate you from your money for very little in return. You seem like very reasonable people and I practically have an allergic reaction to dentists that betray the public's trust like this. It's what inspires me to write my blog and participate in these types of forums. It also goes to show you that Yelp is just one source to consider among several.\n\nIt sounds like you are doing what needs to be done. Let me know if you need any more advice.\nDr. Barniv Susan M: Dr. Barniv,\n\nHere we go again.\n\nAfter finally speaking with the dental office the primary insurance called and explained she was told that D2750 crown is made from pieces of layered porcelain and E.Max, which has no dental code, is one piece of porcelain and it's not layered, so that was the reason for the $150 upgrade.\n\nI then spoke to the secondary insurance and I said we were trying to get back the $150 upgrades on all 4 crowns and wanted her to find out why it was coded D2750 not D2740. She told me that the insurance companies CANNOT tell the dental office how to bill. When she spoke to the dental office she was told that the dental office had signed documentation, (yes we both signed the documentation for PFM crowns) which was a legal contract between us and the dentist for the upgrades.The CIGNA insurance lady told me she would file a financial complaint if we wanted.\n\nOnce again I spoke to the dentist's insurance lady and said yes we did sign the documentation saying we would be getting PFM crowns. I told her I did not think,in a court of law, it is a valid contract because we did not get PFM crowns. She then wanted to know if we could meet halfway with a $75 refund on each crown. At that point I became so upset I could not even talk.\n\nWithin an hour we received a call from the dentist asking what we  wanted him to do. I immediately said to refund the upgrade charges. He informed me he was using the D2750 code to minimize what we had to pay out of pocket. Again he said there is no code for E.Max. I informed him if he had coded it D2740 we would have paid $2 more. He said that he used the D2750 code to minimize our out of pocket expenses of $2.  He then said he would change the code on the 4 crowns to D2740 and would refund the $600, if we put in writing this would be the end of the issues on everything.\n\nWe then told him we could not believe how he never informed my husband of the 3 pulp caps. He said there are a lot of things a dentist does not tell his patients. He then said he would refund the secondary insurance company the $39 paid on the pulp cap because that was taken away from our $1300 benefit maximum.I made it clear to him that the $39 is not the issue here. \n\nMy husband is telling me just to give him a written statement and let it go. Like you wrote to me previously, \"Your inquires, discussions, phone calls, etc. will take a lot of your precious time and energy to sort out. In the end your teeth will be unchanged. So think about what you want to accomplish before going into battle.\" You were SO right!! I feel this dentist is ripping people off left and right, but on the other hand, maybe I should just give him the written statement, get the refund, and let it go.\n\nOnce again I would appreciate your thoughts.\n\nThank you so much for your time.\nSusan Zuri Barniv: I think you should write whatever he wants to get your refund and then move on. $600 is no chump change and you basically won, right? But unfortunately, there were still many 'losers' in the past and there will be many in the future who will not go through the effort you made. I am not a big fan of airing out your dirty laundry online, but the glowing online reviews are what attracted you to this dentist in the first place. Perhaps some online feedback on the same forums would be beneficial to others trying to avoid your situation in the future. \n\nBy the way, any dentist who says, \"...there are a lot of things a dentist does [but does] not tell his patients.\" is probably not the kind of dentist you want to have working on you. I think you already figured that out though. There is NOTHING I do to any of my patients without their consent and knowledge and in most cases, it is in writing. That is your basic right as a patient, that is, to know what a doctor or dentist is doing to you."

    "dialogue": "arsenalfire: My wife received a full set of dentures about 2 years ago and they never worked well from the outset. Too painful to eat, never felt like they fit, and none of the adjustments done by the dentist helped. Now the lower set is broken, mostly due to them going in and out constantly. My question is what options would be be best: should we just start over with a different dentist? Is it possible to get an identical replacement set, and if so, refit from that? Any other options? I don't remember why implants were not recommended, and we would prefer not dealing with the original dentist as he seemed to think she \"should have been more comfortable,\" implying it was her fault. Cosmetically, they were excellent. Zuri Barniv: It's impossible to know how to answer this as there are many reasons a denture might hurt. You also didn't specify if these were full dentures (she has no teeth) or partial ones. But in general, lower full dentures are very problematic even if they are well-made. Upper full dentures are usually easy to get used to and don't hurt. So if she has an upper full denture and that hurts too, I would wonder if she has a special situation or if the dentures just weren't made as well as they could have been. \n\nIf in doubt, go get a second opinion from a \"prosthodontist\". These are dentists that have received extra training in these sorts of problems and he/she might be able to tell you what to do next. This is different than a general dentist."

    "dialogue": "Shrobinson: Hi, I am 32 years old. I have had dental problems for as long as I can remember. I grew up on well water and my parents also have bad teeth. Every time I go to the dentist I have a new or worsening cavity. Today I went to a new dentist to get a second opinion (I had been with my previous dentist for the last 20 years). I asked her to look at everything and to give me a game plan of how to fix my teeth. After all Xrays and an exam she says that I need 6 root canals (1 is a redo of a previous one), of course, the crowns to go along with these. Plus a bridge from where I have had 2 teeth previously removed. The total for all of this after insurance is $10,000. This is not including fixing any of the other cavities that i have. I am extremely frustrated. First, for always dealing with dental problems, secondly, the hole in my pocket from all the procedures, and third, $10k??\nMy question is, being only 32, and frustrated with my own teeth, is it worth just having all my teeth extracted and getting dentures?? the above work is $10k, however, i know i will have more problems in the future with my teeth so why invest my money into this? I hear dentures are coming a long way now. I read recently something about permanent dentures. I'm not sure the cost of these, they may be just as expense. but anyway, any thoughts or suggestions?? I'm at a loss and need to do something soon; before 6 root canals turn into 10! LADentalclinic: Having all of your teeth removed and wearing dentures may seem like an easy alternative.  Dentures have come a long way, but there is nothing like your natural teeth. That is why it is best to keep your natural teeth for as long as possible.  Dentures move and may effect your sense of taste, speech and ability to eat. Implant supported dentures are more stable, but very expensive.  I can understand your frustration.  Make sure that you explore all of your options before deciding on treatment. Troubleteeth: Your fight for teeth sounds alot like mine. I am 49 yrs young and ever since I was a kid I have always had to have fillings at each annual dental visit and I have had to have them all re-done again and again over the years because of decay UNDER the filling or new decay on the teeth despite great oral hygiene habits. I had a bridge fail which took the 2 supporting natural teeth #4&6 with it (havent even finished paying for the failed bridge yet!) and the teeth on either side of it are broken now too. So Ihave a huge gap of missing, broken, decaying roots/teeth. Since you can only fill and re-fill teeth a limited #of times before they have no supportive structure left, I too need about 6-8 more crowns. The problem is, everytime I get a crown it gets further decay UNDER it.I have spent over $12,000, seen 20 different dentists trying to stabilize my teeth and prevent further decay over the last 10 yrs but it has been a losing battle. The reason so many dentists is because I was looking for more affordable treatment at dental colleges but my dental needs were too extensive for their capabilities of the students and I was always sent somewhere else. I have also been referred to other dentists because I have a hard time getting numb for procedures. Its hard to tell which dentist's treatment plan to believe because not one of them match each others! I dont know what to do either. I dont want regular dentures, cant afford implants, but Im so tired and frustrated of this depressing and stressful situation of my teeth falling apart faster than I can fix them."

Thanks. Dentgr: Why don't you get temporary crowns fitted so there will be no surprises? JJ_8613: Hi.\n\nThe longer you wait to get the crowns, the higher the likelihood of the teeth chipping or fracturing.  I'm not sure how long this would take.  It may depend on how big of a cavity the root canal treatment corrected.  I had a tooth with a root canal fracture because I was unable to get a crown right away.  The root canal treatment was 2 years old at the time.\n\nIf you have to wait just be careful with it.  Don't chew hard or sticky things.\n\nIf the tooth starts hurting it could be from a chip or fracture.  Mine chipped and then fractured, but a crown was still able to save it.\n\nJust get the crowns as soon as you can afford them.\n\nGood luck.\n\nJJ"

The lab will start with solid block of zirconia, and craft the bridge using a CAD/CAM system. Further information is that he will trying to do a screw-retained bridge, avoiding cement if possible. Is it true that sometimes they can only fit a 3 unit bridge where 4 natural teeth used to be? If so, how common is this?

    "dialogue": "IzzyWhizz: I have a dentist appointment on Tuesday. I'm already very nervous as I haven't been for a long time and I suffer from severe anxiety. Earlier I was inspecting my teeth when I noticed what appears to be either a chip in my tooth or a chip in the filling in my tooth. I can also see a dark line where it looks like the filling is coming away from the tooth. It's already a huge filling and I'm so scared that I'm going to lose my tooth. I've attached an image of the area and was wondering if anyone could give me a vague prognosis, I appreciate that it's difficult to tell what's going on from a picture. Thanks in advance for any advice. drmins: Its a chipped tooth structure. Go for an IOPAR x-ray. If there is any underlying secondary caries or if you are much aesthetic concerned about the metal filling,you can go for a tooth colored re-restoration. Else,any remineralising tooth paste will be a good choice for time being."

    "dialogue": "thailen: My girl friend has two lower jaw gaps, each gap missing two teeth. We are considering both implants and bridges. Obviously, there is a huge difference in price if we do 4 implants, plus her dentist says he wouldn't do a four unit bridge if the total width of the four teeth is more than 47 mm. There is another possibility which I suddenly thought about doing. That is having one implant filling half of each gap, waiting until the new implants heal, then having two 3  unit bridges made, again, a significant cost savings and clearly considerably narrower than 47 mm. Plus, the chances of the 3-unit bridge lasting and performing well should be better than a 4 unit bridge. What are the pros and cons of each choice? Dentgr: You shouldn't consider as an option a 3-unit bridge attached on implant and natural tooth.\nGo for a 4 unit bridge or ideally 2 implants per site. Toothman19: I agree. There's no reason you can't do a 4 unit bridge. Just make sure the doc is prescribing the right material. Would have to be pfm or zirconia or gold(expensive). Emax isn't strong enough for that large of a bridge."

I just can't seem to get the drill that far back. I find most of the time I end up using the slow speed drill to remove the decay since the slow speed head fits in better but when it comes to finishing, I have to use the high speed and that poses a challenge. If I ask the pt to open wide to get the drill head in, then the buccal mucosa (cheek gets in my way). Also if the restoration is close to the gingiva, how can I get good isolation. Also i find because there is so much buccal mucosa in the way even when I retract with a mirror and place a dri-angle I still end up hidding the cheek causing a tear. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated\n\nThanks! Dentgr: If it's close to gingiva use retraction cord.\nI usually ask the patient to medium open the mouth. I also place the mirror between the tooth and the cheek ,parallel to the tooth, to avoid contact of the drill with cheek. It's still difficult in many cases.\n\nSorry for my English...."

    "title": "Teeth burn after restoration",
    "dialogue": "Tracey001: I am a 58 year-old female. in 2/2013 a dentist recommended mouth restoration as a resolution to my oralfacial pain. The orthotic used prior (3-4 months) to the restoration proved that maloclusion was the problem as the fog lifted, horrid pain was gone; the only problem was slight sensitivity in the front upper teeth. The dentist said that the sensitivity would not worsen with the restoration as those teeth would be sealed. Then, 14 teeth were reconstructed on 6/2013 (#22-27; #5-12) cost $27K. Note that nothing was wrong with the teeth, except worn enamel) nor gums, the teeth were just in the wrong place which caused malocculsion. The morning after the restoration the 4 front upper (#7-10) and lower teeth (#23-26) burned like acid was being poured on them. When temps were removed, dentist performed emergency root canal on broken #26; that tooth reacts to percussion and has turned black at the root. The burning pain in those teeth hasn't stopped (been 20 months) and it worsens after I talk, eat or any percussion and they  react to hot and cold, except#26. I have been drinking meal replacements for breakfast and lunch, and soft foods for dinner. I am unable to bite into anything using those front teeth. Forget anything chewy or crunchy and forget kissing, talking and laughing. After dinner the burning pain in those teeth goes through the roof.  I am unable to tolerate pain meds and currently taking Neurontin which does help alleviate the pain. Recently went through two rounds of the medrol pack which alleviated the pain altogether for two days. Since the restoration, I have visited 9 dental specialists (DMDs, Prothedontist, Periodontist, prosthdontist, neuromuscular dentist, endodontists) and all have said they never have seen nor heard of a case like mine and there is absolutely no reason for my teeth to burn. My gums are perfect, the margins on the crowns are perfect, no infection, no inflammation. One DMD diagnosed BMS, but I have no symptoms; no dry mouth, no sores, no burning mouth, and the recommend klonapin didn't help the burning pain. I have seen allergists/NAET, chiropractors and massage specialists as well, to no avail.  I am currently wearing another orthotic ($5K for orthotic and diagnostics) made by the #1 neuromuscular dentist in my area, who thought possibly ligament sprain could be the problem. It hasn't helped the burning teeth.  He recommends lower back (8) teeth ($13K) reconstrucion, and absolutely refuses to work at all on those front burning teeth. My bloodwork is impeccable; no vitamin deficiencies; perfect blood pressure. Note that novaccaine injection makes the burning pain immediately go away; the dentists and others say \"interesting\", but will not tell my why. I am seriously considering extracting those teeth, and was told that no one would extract them due to my good oral health.  Could lingual nerve damage be the cause? Any other diagnosis or treatment recommendation?"

Sometimes when you have been through a lot already with a tooth you may come to a point of frustration and just want to take it out. A crown could work in this case, but without knowing all of the information about the tooth it is possible that the crack will not be fixed with a crown.\n\nIf taking this tooth out will not hamper your wife's eating ability I think that an extraction is a good option.

Firstly, are those old crowns matching with your other natural tooth?\n\nIf not, why dont change both of them? \n\nShade matching is not really a guess game.Its possible to get a near to natural crown done.\nIf there are stain issues,you can consider having a pic done by your dentist,to be sent to the technician.\n\nI always recommend metal free crowns like e-max and zirconia crowns for front teeth.\n\nThank you\nDr.mins michaels01: hi, are metal free crowns like e-max and zirconia crowns strong enough for front teeth? I have a front teeth but has a metal post, what's benafit of metal free crowns? drmins: Zirconia crowns are excellent in terms of strength too. For metal free crowns,we always recommend fibre posts,not metal posts. \nAesthetically,metal free crowns are much superior to the normal porcelain fused to metal or PFM crowns. michaels01: Are there other benefits with zirconia crown and fibre post? Would the fibre post be lighter and easier on the tooth?\n\nAlso I have to redo one of my crowns, is it bad to the root (the remaining natural tooth) if a crown is redo too many times? Would it weaken the structure of the root? drmins: The main benefit of zirconia crowns and emax crowns is aesthetics.You can have a better marginal adaptation with these,and the possibility of having that black line between the tooth and the gums are less or nill, with these.\nFiber posts were recommended for metal free crowns,to give better aesthetics. \n\nIf done properly,redoing the crown will not weaken your tooth any way.\n\nGo ahead. Cheers. michaels01: Would  zirconia crown also be metal free so I won't have any alergic reaction to it?  \n\nMy crown feels uncomfortable sometimes, not sure if it's because I'm alergic to it, what are some common causes of a uncomfortable crown? drmins: Yes. Zirconia crowns are metal free.\nWhat is the uncomfortable thing about your present crown? Pls provide a pic of the same for better understanding. movemen: I like to add that sometimes matching a crown with an existing crown is very difficult because one lab might use different material than the other lab or the mixing of the porcelain is not the same with every batch.  using zirconia or emax crowns for front teeth will increase likely that the shade will match or natural teeth michaels01: I just had a crown redone, I noticed my crown on my front tooth sits above the gum line from the inside, from the outside it's ok.. so basically from the inside the crown is a bit above the natural tooth structure - I have very few natural tooth left, which sits near the gum line. From the outside I see crown, then gumline.. from the inside it goes crown, natural tooth, then gumline... is this normal?? Should I get this crown redone?\nAlso I found I'm very sensitive to this crown when I'm tired or sick, is that normal? If I'm healthy, I don't notice the crown as much, but if I'm sick or tired, I sometimes find the crown very uncomfortable? I will be sensitive to one spot where it's not smooth and also the roughness where it connects to the natural tooth. this only happens to this crown on my front top tooth, I also have a crown on my lower front tooth, I don't notice it much at all. what could be causing this? could I have a nerve near the crown or something that gets irritated??"

    "dialogue": "Brittany: I had a root canal done about 2 years ago. Lately I have noticed the tooth (which is towards the front of my mouth) getting darker. I went to a dentist that was recommended by my orthodontist. The dentist took xrays and said that he would be unable to fill it with bleach because he was afraid the tooth would crack because it is so hallow. So he said the only option is to put a crown over it, which I am fine with. He said I would have to have 3 separate appointments. He will have to put a piece of metal in the tooth to act as the stability for the tooth and then put the crown over it. For this one tooth it is going to cost me 4 times as much as what some other people I have talked to has paid for a crown. I suppose the reasoning for the high cost is because of this piece being placed. My only concern is if it is necessary to have this piece placed there. I have heard of many people having root canals and then needing to have a crown but I have never heard of there being a piece of metal in there that is specially made for the tooth. My mother in law has had a root canal done and then had a crown put on and it cost her $1800 less than what I am going to be charged. I am just curious as to if this is necessary or if this is just a way to make more money and it really isn't all that necessary. LADentalclinic: It sounds like you are describing a post and buildup.  Is your tooth broken?  Sometimes a post is placed within a  tooth to add strength before a crown is placed.  If your tooth is not badly broken or decayed a post is not usually necessary.  If you feel uncomfortable I would recommend that you get a second opinion to put your mind at ease.  I'm not sure what country you're in, but in the US a post, buildup, and crown should cost a lot less than $1800. Brittany: Thank you for your response. I do live in the US, in Iowa. My tooth is not cracked or broken. He mentioned that by looking at the xrays it was rather hollow and thought it was weak. He actually told me the total cost will be $2600, which is $1800 more than what my mother in law has paid a different dentist to put a crown on hers.  Again, thank you very much for your response. movemen: For front teeth, a crown is usually not needed. If the front tooth has large decay and causing the need for root canal then a crown is necessary. A hollow canal is all  depends on the age of the patient. A younger person would have a more hollow canal. Usually i would just do internal bleaching for front teeth to solve the discoloration"

Which tooth is it on? drmins: Its either a GlC or composite filling. Amalgam fillings are more radio-opaque.\nThe 'shadow' possibly refers to a translucency in the x-ray image. But no significant radiolucency is observed in the radiographs provided (may be due to the poor image quality while uploading). However,from the image provided,the possibility is that your dentist was talking about your second premolar where the mesial end of the filling shows a mild \"shadow\" beneath it. This can be a void due to 'not so well condensed' filling material,or a secondary caries. In composite fillings,some times such secondary caries or \"shadows\" are more seen,than in a GIC filling.If that is the case,you may go for a new filling or wait for any symptom to appear. Your dentist can help you conclude it,with a better radiograph. movemen: I think it is the first premolar on distal surface and it does have a radiolucency right underneath the fillings and this simply means the decay wasn't completely removed in the oringinal filling procedure"

These would be needed to give you a complete diagnosis.  Since you didn't post any x-rays, you should ask your dentist to give you a written treatment plan that explains all of the work that you need done and the cost.  Once you have a treatment plan, you can have your teeth restored at your own pace."

LADentalclinic: Did your instructor not check the patient when you were finished?   I remember what it was like to be a dental student. I would talk to your instructor. The tooth will not \"debond\" itself.  In my opinion, the filling will need to be redone so the patient can floss properly. mmonkey23: Yes my tutor did check the patient and tried to separate the teeth with a polishing strip. My tutor said that I may have to redo the restoration at the next appointment. Thank you."

    "title": "Do I really need a crown? Or should I get a second opinion?",
    "dialogue": "Leah: A little over two weeks ago I was in a minor accident and the impact was to my face, with the most long term damage to one of my teeth.\nAs a result, one of my front central incisors has two horizontal (half moon/rainbow shaped) cracks in it; one sitting on top of the other. The cracks cover about 25% of the tip of my tooth. I can't tell if the cracks go through to the back side of my tooth, however I believe it is simply a crack in the enamel, as the tooth is not sensitive to cold or hot.\nI have been going to one dentist office for the past three years, run by father and son dentists. I have always been scheduled with the son and have always had great service and work done, with wisdom tooth extractions being the extent of my needs. After the accident, I was able to make an urgent appointment and I assume that is why I was scheduled with the father this time.\nAt the first appointment he said it wasn't as bad as he thought it was going to be after what I described over the phone. The assistant took an x-ray, and the dentist said that there were no visible fractures beyond the gum line and no apparent abscess, so he wanted to wait until my teeth \"settled down\" and weren't so loose from the accident to see how things were going to be. He did warn me that I may need a crown. He also told me that I have cavities on the top front 6 teeth in between each tooth.\nAt my follow up two weeks later, I explained that everything has gotten much better. I can now talk without pain from tapping my teeth together, and I can even use my front teeth very gently to bite into soft foods. I even ate a cheeseburger the other day and everything was fine as long as the majority of the pressure was on the opposite side of my mouth. A week before this, I was at the point where I was struggling to find the right position to put a straw in my mouth so my top lip didn't put pressure on my cracked tooth. This was also about the time that my lateral incisor was still loose and causing me similar pain (it was knocked slightly sideways in the accident.) However, now my lateral incisor causes me no pain at all and at the two week follow up my dentist filed down a little behind that tooth because it was affecting my bite since my tooth is now slightly crooked. I told him that my cracked tooth is not painful to the touch anymore, although I'm sure if I were to hit it hard then it would hurt. I believe it is still a little loose, and I do get a strange feeling when I put pressure on it in any direction. I tried to explain to him the feeling was similar to what you would imagine when you think of the word \"fresh.\" He suggested an electric-type feeling. Sort of. He said that could be the tooth continuing to heal. However, he now believes that I will have to get a crown, and is insisting on filling my cavities in one month. His opinion is that if in one month from now when I go in to fill the cavities that \"electric\" feeling hasn't gone away completely that I need a crown.\nI do not have dental insurance, the front desk knows that, and I made it clear to the dentist at my first appointment with him after the accident. I asked him if there were other options, and he told me that even if he decides that I don't need a crown in a month, there is a 60% chance I will need one at some point down the road. On my way out, I received an estimate for getting the cavities on five (even though the dentist said six) teeth done.\nI am hoping that my tooth continues to feel better and better each day, and that I do not have to get a cap. I am worried that this father dentist may be too eager to put a cap on my tooth. Since I don't have dental insurance, my last visit with a dentist was one year ago almost exactly (with the son dentist) for a general cleaning/check up and I also requested an x-ray to examine the two remaining impacted wisdom teeth. I got a fancy 360-degree x-ray. The son dentist never mentioned any cavities in my front top teeth. I'm not sure if I should assume the son dentist just never noticed these even though he always seemed very thorough, or if I have developed cavities in between all six top front teeth within one year, or if there really are no cavities and I am being scammed?\nIn my life, I have had two very small cavities and that was it. My parents had my teeth sealed when I was younger and I believe that contributed to the health of my teeth. Even as an adult, I hardly ever eat candy or sweets and I just didn't expect so many cavities out of the blue like this, not to mention at the same exact time I am being told I need to shell out a ton of money for a crown?\nYes the cracks are unpleasant to look at, but I would be more than happy to live with them than get a crown if I can avoid it; as long as I'm not making it worse for myself in the long run by not getting it capped if it really is necessary. I don't know if this dentist sees a crown as the last resort like I do. I have trusted this dental clinic for years and now that I am feeling uneasy, I don't know if I can trust another dentist that I have never seen before to get a second opinion.\nDoes this really sound like I will need a crown? LADentalclinic: It's hard to say without seeing a copy of your x-ray.  If you're feeling a lot of discomfort on your tooth the nerve may be damaged due to the trauma of your accident.  A root canal may be needed.  I know that's not what you want to hear.  Yes cavities can develop in a year.  If you feel uncomfortable with the diagnosis that you were given you may choose to get a second opinion.  There's nothing wrong with that."

I was such a good boy.\n\nBut a few years ago I really began to notice the white streaks on my canines and incisors.  Based on my talking with my dentist and my own research, it's fluorosis.\n\nSince my condition is not terrible, I will go with an over-the-counter whitener to see what happens.  I have heard many of the more extreme whiteners rarely fix fluorosis.\n\nI will do my research on which toothpaste/mouthwash to go with for best whitening.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts/flaws in my plan?\n\nI will report back what happens.  Hopefully it will make the white streaks diminish while bring up the white of the rest of my teeth. PrinceCharles: My fluorosis is made more prominent by teeth whitening and additional fluoride. Does CG MI Paste (Tooth Mousse) work as a possible solution to fluorosis and white spot lesions? LADentalclinic: The best treatment for you may be dental veneers.  Has your dentist spoken to you about them? Veneers or crowns may be the only way to achieve the look that you want. LADentalclinic: Internal whitening is another option. PrinceCharles: I had never heard of internal bleaching until I just looked it up.Looks like the tooth becomes dead after that particular procedure. If I should decide to do crowns, what's the best option for my front 4 teeth on top? I have heard of all porcelain, PFMs, and CERIC. What are the pros and cons to these types? Thanks for your response! LADentalclinic: All porcelain looks the best.  PFM is the strongest.  It stands for Porcelain fused to metal.  The inside is metal with porcelain over the top.  I'm not a big fan of CERIC crowns.  They tend to break more easily than PFM's.  All porcelain veneers are the most conservative.  They look natural and require the removal of little to none of your natural teeth depending on which type you get.  Lumineers brand veneers are thin like a contact lens yet strong and pretty."

So he drilled the canine tooth and he put what I'm assuming is temporary dental cement around the canine he drilled and partially on my first premolar (im assuming to protect it?)

Once it's made we use permanent cement to seat it.  I would still let the dentist know what happened."

She would have charged about 60% of what the other dentist would. However, despite working extensively in reconstructive dentistry, Dr. Malkin suggested cleaning up my Mom's existing problems instead of creating custom bridges.  She was great about checking with my Mom's GP to be sure there would be no safety concerns with Mom's Coumadin and other meds.  She took her time talking to my Mom and let her set the pace for getting the work done.\nMy Mom feels so much better now, she can eat a LOT more foods and is much happier!

I have had only two sets of replacement teeth on posts since then the last set lasting me some 18 years. Great dentist inserted crowns called King Crowns and never had a problem.\nOnly now I have had an infection under one of the teeth which clears up after anti biotics but then comes back after a while. Coupled with bone loss and one of them being lose I took the decision to have them removed. I have had numerous inspections by different dentists and all agreed there was not enough bone left for implants. I did not want to bridge as i do not see the point of damaging surrounding teeth to support a bridge. Only option left was dentures (to my horror)\nI opted for Valplast and am very very happy with the results you cannot distinguish them and in fact they look better than my crowns. But i am worried!\nI have read so much about teeth shifting and further bone loss that I am now convinced that the surrounding teeth will fail and i will end up on a slow road to exractions. Is this correct? Is there something I can do to stop the shifting or bone loss around my missing teeth? They are all healthy so do not want to lose them.\nHave I made the right decision in dentures although I think apart from the bridge i had no option. FYI Bone grafting has never been an option neither financially or morally. I have 4 children so would not spend that sort of money on myself.\nWill the Valplast support the teeth either side so they do not move?\nThankyou LADentalclinic: More adults lose teeth due to bone loss than decay.  The way to prevent bone loss is practicing good oral hygiene at home (brushing at least twice a day and flossing at least once a day) and having regular dental cleanings.  When calculus or tartar builds up on teeth and is not removed it damages the surrounding bone."

    "title": "Unknown Sensitivity",
    "dialogue": "Curteye: So several months ago when getting a checkup, the dentist noticed that a filling was either wearing out, or a cavity was formed near it.  I don't really remember those specifics but either way it was sensitive in that area and I got the filling replaced.\n\nHowever, the sensitivity remained.  That is, when chewing certain foods, particularly crunchy ones, I would feel a slight jolt of soreness that lasts no longer than a second.  I returned to my dentist who adjusted the filling in case it was too high, which I believe is a common problem.\n\nThe problem still remained for weeks after that, so I went back and the dentist took tests like x-rays and checks for infection and nothing was discovered.  She adjusted the filling one more time but said if that doesn't work she'll just have to try to replace the filling and hope that will fix whatever the undetermined problem is.  And indeed, the soreness remains.\n\nI've tried using different kinds of Sensodyne in case it helps, but to no avail.\n\nI'm kind of wondering if it's coincidence that my soreness is near where the filling was restored, and it could be from a different problem.  I once fractured a tooth from clenching too much and I remember having similar symptoms before this happened - however one of the tests on this new problem tooth was tapping on it with a tool to see if I felt any pain, but I didn't (but pretty sure I would have felt something if it was a clenching issue?)  Even though I broke the clenching habit during the day, it could be a night thing - so I got a Doctor's Night Guard that I've been using lately just in case (but so far no improvement).\n\nAnyway, just hoping to get some feedback here before I return to the dentist yet again, especially since it sounds like replacing the filling is not a sure thing.  I know I rambled on for a bit so if anything needs clarifying let me know.\n\nAny thoughts are appreciated.  Thanks! LADentalclinic: It can take several weeks for a tooth to fully recover from treatment.  If the decay was close to the nerve that could explain your sensitivity.  Clinching your teeth can also cause a fracture that may not appear on a dental x-ray."

My dentist was thinking that I should have the lower canines AND lower lateral incisors as abutment teeth to bridge (what will soon be) the gap.  Is it possible to NOT use my canines as abutment teeth? Will it still be effective? LADentalclinic: The canines are some of the strongest teeth in the mouth.  That may be why your dentist recommended adding them to the bridge.  Without seeing an x-ray its hard to say, but your dentist should be able to explain his or her recommendation.

Both are mercury free and the latter is more likely what was used on you. willn: Thanks very much Thomas, I'll read up on that, really appreciate your help, Will LADentalclinic: If you're referring to tooth #30 that's definitely an amalgam filling.  From the picture I can see several composite fillings in your mouth, but the fresh looking gray one is what you've referred to as a mercury filling. It will get darker as it ages. ( Actually called amalgam because it is a mixture of several metals and does contain some mercury)  I personally have several in my mouth and don't mind them, but if you paid for a composite filling you may want to ask for a refund. thomas m mcconnell: Dear LADentalclinic , I agree with you that #30 is definitely an amalgam filling....but is it an amalgam that contains mercury ? I have placed over 50,000  traditional mercury amalgams in my practice and like you I could assume quickly that this is one also......but, the  patient paid  49 pounds extra to get a mercury free filling. I feel compelled to believe that our  fellow dentist is honorable and a credit to our profession and  from that point of view may have indeed restored the tooth with a \"gallium-palladium alloy\".......(also an amalgam that contains \"several metals\" but  no \"Mercury\") and looks very similar to our traditional mercury amalgams. Alas, the patient did not pay for a composite filling but wanted a mercury free filling. I would very much like the patient to ask the dental provider what he did in fact use to restore #30 and share the answer with us."

So early last year I noticed the tooth was starting to darken in colour and decided to get a crown fitted.\n\nWhen the dentist ground down the tooth so a crown could be attached, the remaining stump was almost black, and the dentist called over his assistant to show her, saying he'd never seen anything like it before. \n\nSo 9 months later the crown has become very loose after biting into some crusty bread. As this has happened over the Christmas break, my dentist is on holiday until 8th Jan, so I've had to see another dentist at the same practice for an emergency appointment.

I have brushed my teeth at least once a day since I was little. But they came anyways. I am in not pain of discomfort as of now and haven't been ever. I was wondering what choices I have in getting them fixed. I know that one will most likely have to be pulled the bottom right pointy tooth (sorry don't know the technical name). The whole front of the tooth's enamel is missing except for the tip of the tooth. I know I should have been a lot better with brushing and flossing!!! Also have about 7 other teeth with small holes near the gum line. 2 on the inside near my tongue and the rest near my cheeks. 3 of them are on the back molars. Is there anyway these can be fixed or will they have to rip them out. I am planning on joining the Army later this year so I have to get this fixed as soon as possible. But I also cant go with all fake teeth, I am just wondering what my choices are in getting these fixed. What should I be telling the dentist when I call and make the first appointment (i.e. Hey I want to come in I have a ton of holes in my teeth. Have fun!!) I just want to make sure I get everything fixed and have an idea about what should be done. kellogg9: Once a day is NOT enough bro!  Need to brush at least after each meal AND floss DentalDirectSales: They might be able to fix it, but since your new jobs insurance covers it, I would go see your dentist, see what he/she can do with them. Then I would up your brushings from 1 time a day to about 3 times a day(after every meal). It's apparent that the brushing you are doing aren't covering all the things you eat and drink throughout the day, which is leading to the decay and cavities."

    "dialogue": "vicodeez: Hi, I'm 23 years old and I had a accident and knocked my 2 upper front teeth out a few years ago.  My dentist referred me to someone for implants.  Instead of doing 2 implants he wanted to pull the tooth next to where the 2 are gone, because he said the tooth had a cyst and would most likely die eventually even with a root canal done.  He said the best and healthiest option would to do 2 implants for a 3 crown bridge so there is space between the implants to breath.  He said 3 implants in a row is not good.  The process went fine, but now that i have the permanent crowns in my mouth, i am having trouble getting used to them.  I had a lot of bone damage and even with a bone graft the gums/bone line are not up to par with the other teeth.  In order to make up for the lack of tissue, the crowns have a pink material to blend in with my gums.  It looks decent, definitely not perfect.  You can still see some black lines on the side and upper part of the bridge.  I'm not sure why it still doesn't feel good after a couple weeks of being in.  I had the temporary bridge in for about a month and I never got used to them.  I'm afraid that i will never get used to this bridge.  The reason why i got it in the first place was because I had no self esteem if i didn't have teeth in and i was also told by a lot of sources that it's not good to not have a full set of teeth in your mouth, natural or not.  The look of it and the feel of it has been stressing me out for weeks and I finally got around to posting here due to anxiety.  I'm not sure if I'm being rational or not, but I felt the need to post here for advice maybe. Tooth man: Supported Bridge\n\nYou are young and absolutely needed to get what you had done - DONE!  I have had bridges, caps and all kinds of things done to my mouth...sometimes it worked out great and other times took me a while to get use to and other times I had to go back to my dentist and have things fixed.\n\nYou have to take care of your teeth, and the things you get done to them.  If you have to go back to dentist explain the problems and demand, in a nice way that they correct it.\n\nDo you have insurance or a discount dental plan? vicodeez: I do take care of my teeth.  I brush and floss daily.  It was an accident that i knocked out my front teeth.  The rest of my teeth have no problems and are clean.  It's not as simple as correcting it either.  There was a lot of bone and gum damage and even w/ a bone and gum graft, the bridge is in a higher position than the rest of my teeth.  They put pink stuff on the top to make it blend in w/ my gums, but it doesn't look good if you look at it closely.  I don't have any insurance, because if you go to the dentist twice a year w/o insurance, it would cost the same as going to the dentist w/ it."

    "dialogue": "n0tmyfault83: I shall preface this post with this:  I'm ignorant to all things dental.  I have been trying to educate myself to make better informed decisions on my teeth and overall wellness.\n\nI'm a 30-year-old, living in Northern California (near Sacramento) and I have the basic dental insurance from Delta Dental provided my by employer.  I brush 2x a day with a Braun electric toothbrush and I floss in the evening (I know...I should floss in the morning...but that's another debate which I have with my wife on a regular basis....).\n\n\nThis all started in February, 2012 (during the super bowl party).  I was enjoying a beer and a hotdog, or whatever I was eating and my filling came out of my back, right side molar.  Well, I thought I'd circumvent the major inconvienance by eating on my left side until I could make it to the dentist the following week.  And then my tooth chipped.  There was no pain, however.  Just anxiety....of visiting the dentist.\n\n\nSo, I went to the dentist.  Access Dental, that is...GAH!  I have heard from everyone, \"OMG! Don't go there!\"  However, I have never heard the reasons why, other than they butcher your teeth supposively?  Well, it was too late...I had already started the process and I hate change.  My only flaw....lol \n\n\nThey do a basic cleaning, x-rays, and stated I need a crown--but no root canal.  They do the crown prep and fit me with a temporary crown.  I go in for the delivery.  The dentist doesn't like the crowns fit.  Re-do crown prep.  I go in for delivery.  New dentist. Doesn't like the crown fit.  Re-do crown prep.  I go in for delivery.  New Dentist.  Doesn't like the crown fit.  I'm not kidding...\n\nSo lets recap this.\n\nI have had 3 different dentist.  I believe I have 4 different crown preps and 3 delivery attempts.  Over the course of 14 months, which is partially my fault due to my hectic work and out of town training schedules.\n\nThey are not charging me anything extra for all these preps/deliveries.  And I'm thankful they are not just throwing the crown on and calling it good when there's space on the fitting that would allow bacteria in and start decaying my tooth.\n\nI'm wondering, is this normal? Or perhaps, in some cases, have dentist had a problem with a particular patient's crown delivery due to the tooths positioning or what not?  I'm going in for my 4th delivery attempt and I'm wondering if I should think about switching dentist...Is this a failure on their part? The labs fault? A bit of both?  Would a qualified, well-experienced dentist have these types of issue?\n\nMy problem is, I have no way of measuring a dentists' worth other than minimal google ratings or word of mouth.  But ones experience can change from patient to patient.\n\nI'm not bashing Access Dental.  I think they are beyond friendly; however, I'm questiong their always-changing dentists' quality of work.\n\nAny recommendations? Please, please, please elaborate! jpalmer: Access is state or governement funded health care. Typically it is going to be fast paced, high volume lower quality care. The reality is in life you usually get what you pay for.\n\nThe crown is made at a lab, usually outside of the office. The quality/fit of the crown is based on several factors, the original impression quality, the crown material, the skill of the lab technician. Any one of those factors need to be checked and or corrected to get a properly fitting crown. Based on errors in anyone of those steps leads to more adjustments at the seating of the crown.\n\nYou can request take a new impression and start from scratch.\nGood luck! moon: I'm just a consumer, but one who had a whole-mouth restoration with a most remarkably skilled dentist, and if I were you I would seriously start over with a good dentist if that's an option.\n\nI had so much bad dental work in my life before finding my dentist, and can tell you the difference is night/day.   It's worth it to find someone excellent who you can establish a relationship with.\n\nAck - just saw you posted this a while ago and likely have your crown and have moved on and won't ever read this"

    "title": "Need to restore #9,10 + Hole in Maxilla",
    "dialogue": "trmorrisnd: I am 43, and have been missing teeth #9 and 10 for my entire life. I took a bad fall on my mouth as an infant and damaged both the deciduous and adult teeth—both sets of which had to be removed surgically. I had a Marilyn bridge put into place when I was 14 and this lasted until a cracked molar filling changed my bite at age 40 and I started tapping on it with occlusion. Then some minor facial fractures in the L maxilla moved teeth 11 and 12 lingually and the trusty Marilyn bridge had to be removed after 25 years.\n\nThere was a plan to move 11 and 12 outward, get a bone graft for a sizable defect in the superior ridge, and put in two implants for 9 and 10. After a CT of the anterior ridge, this plan of a graft with two implants was deemed not a viable option due to the amount of missing bone (a full-on A→P hole) and proximity of the bone gap to the central nerve foramen (~1mm). Canine tooth #11 is still out of place presently causing significant malocclusion after both Invisalign and Bioliner-Plus (with pegs and bands) failed to move it appreciably. \n\nAnd so, I have stalled out at a crossroads on my restoration work for my missing #9 and #10 teeth, and would appreciate some perspective. \n\nPresently, I'm still trying to decide about whether to proceed with or without a bone graft. Even with a graft, I would need to decide whether to go with: a single implant with cantilevered pontics, another Marilyn bridge, or a conventional 4-tooth bridge. Putting it all together, I've really got 5 sets of options. \n\n1.\tOrthodontics, No graft, Marilyn bridge: Less expensive, saves teeth #8, 11 but less permanent and leaves misaligned #11 in place that may require prior orthodontics or major adjustments.\n2.\tNo graft, conventional 4-tooth bridge: Better outcome with matching #8 & 9, able to effectively move the misaligned #11 with the new bridge.\n3.\tOrthodontics, Bone Graft, Marilyn bridge: Better alveolar ridge shape, less likely to show soft tissue gap with high smile, possible to do a single or pair of implants later(??), #11 requires othodontics or a major adjustment.\n4.\tBone Graft, conventional 4-tooth bridge: Matching #8 & 9, Better alveolar ridge shape, less likely to show gap with high smile, but later implants are not a good option, since teeth #8, 11 are reduced to pegs and would require crowns. \n5.\tOrthodontics, Bone graft, single implant w/ 2-cantilvered pontics: Most expensive, teeth 8 & 9 do not match, leaves #7 in place that may require orthodontics.\n\nI’m not made of money, and I’m not a fan of dental surgery. My feeling is to go with option #1, 2, or 3. I am concerned about whether the A-P hole in the maxilla above teeth #9, 10 is a problem in itself, so I’d put #3 on the table too. Anything’s possible.\n\nQuestions:\n•\tWhat's my best option?\n•\tDoes leaving the boney gap there, pose more or different risks than filling it in with a graft? (e.g. Is it possible that it is a cyst harboring an infection?) \n•\tDoes letting the graft heal for a longer time make a two separate implants more likely to be possible later on?\n\nFeel free to call me (20six.947.491five) or reply to this thread. \n\nMay we all be well!\n~T.R. Morris, ND\nSeattle, WA boluno: Crossroads\n\nHi,\nI just registered to an account and found your post. I hope my input is still on time. If possible, I would go for orthodontics,  the bone graft and implants on #9 and #10. The implants will help to stimulate the bone, preventing further resorption. If you get a conventional bridge from 8-11, even if you graft the ridge, the bone will shrink over time. This will generate spaces under the bridge over time. You may still need to have veneers on #7 and #8 in order to perfectly match your new implant crowns. Do not forget to have a mouth guard after the treatment is completed. It will help to prevent tooth wear on the lower front teeth and prevent veneers from popping off if you grind your teeth at night. \nNote: #8 is not a great candidate for a bridge of that span. It has a fairly conical root,\n\nDr. Bolivar Luperon,\nProsthodontist, Cosmetic and Family Dentist\nhcident.com"

    "dialogue": "BrightSmile: Haha-  actually my problem starts like this:\n\nI had silver fillings placed by an older dentist on my 6y molars when I was very young-  he believed that this was a good prophylaxis against cavities that would be likely in young kids with poor brushing habits-  this was in the mid 70s.  About ten years ago on a routine dental visit, my dentist noticed that one of them was missing, placed a sealant, and cautioned me that the tooth was drilled quite low for a protective filling, and that a root canal might be in my future.  About two years later, I developed an infection in same tooth necessitating said root canal. Late last week, up very late with a long to-do list, I was in need of quick energy, grabbed a piece of very hard candy and broke this crown on the lateral side (the part visible, naturally!).  I was at my dentist (someone very new to me, as I recently moved) today for an evaluation of what to do next.  The crown is about seven years old.\n\nPer his exam, this crown was a porcelain cap on a metal base.  The crown part which covers my root canal is in good shape, I was told.  In an effort to smooth down the rough exposed porcelain part, he buffed (for lack of a better word) the cracked crown down a bit and we discussed options.  I was given three:\n\n1) Live with what remains in my mouth now because it is structurally sound  (I think this is the most conservative option, but I am meticulous about my dental care, and hate that I have a crown to begin with.  I hate that you can see a bit of the metal underlay, and after this buffing job, it is even more visible still.  I have a huge smile, and when I smile, you can see a little of this tooth visible.  To me it looks awful and it's quite embarrassing.)\n\n2) Dentist will attempt to remove cap intact.  I was cautioned that porcelain may crack, necessitating whole new metal and porcelain insert be redone.  I was told that the metal cap fits very nicely in there and my dentist does not seem to want to remove it.\n\n3) Dentist, in attempting to remove crown may be unable to do so, necessitating sawing off the metal bit in there.  Worst case scenario, existing tooth underneath may fracture in the process requiring bigger dental surgery (not sure exactly what) plus potentially having to have implant placed. \n\nI would appreciate a second or third opinion on what to do.  My interests are purely cosmetic-  My smile is my single favorite feature, but I am wondering if I might make a less than ideal scenario much much worse.  I also have no idea what the worst case scenario involves cost-wise.  Do I see a cosmetic dentist to have this type of work done?  How would you advise a patient in a similar circumstance?\n\nThanks so very much for your help!  (For a geographic reference point, I live about 90 minutes west of Philadelphia.)  -Jill"

    "dialogue": "Carabiniero8: I recently switched dentists. I have every confidence in my new dentist, he is experienced and I trust him. About a month ago, I had a routine 2-sided dental filling. Because I once had a reaction to anesthetic with epinephrine at my previous dentist's office (racing heart, twitching arms & legs), I asked the new dentist to use an alternative anesthetic. He used carbocaine to which I had a really strong negative reaction (this did not happen at my old dentist's after she stopped using epinephrine). I started feeling funny after one shot, but then he needed to administer a second shot because I was not going numb quickly enough. After the second shot, I nearly fainted and everything went black, though I was still semi-aware of what was going on around me, but could not open my eyes and heard loud ringing in my ears. He needed to administer oxygen to help me breathe. It was the first time I had such a reaction to any drug anywhere! I was never scared to go to the dentist before, especially for a routine filling, but I am now really nervous! I have to get another filling next week, and I can't decide whether I should ask him to use Lidocaine, which contains epinephrine, or stick with carbocaine. I checked with my old dentist who moved out of town, and he said that he would have either used lidocaine or carbocaine. My question is - does lidocaine ALWAYS come with epinephrine? \n\nIs it possible that because I did not have much to eat that day, I somehow had a much stronger than normal reaction to carbocaine? Is carbociane supposed to go into your bloodstream, or does it stay localized to the jaw bone? If it's not supposed to go into your blood stream could it have somehow gotten into mine anyway, either by accident or because the doctor accidentally gave me a shot into the wrong area?\n\nFeeling your brain slowly shutting down on you is an extremely scary feeling and I would rather bear physical pain than go through that again, so I just really want to figure out what went wrong and make sure it does not happend again!\n\nAny input would be much appreciated!

I had a temporary filling up until 2011, which was then patched up with a permanent filling. An orthodontic band was placed around the tooth in 2010, because my Orthodontist needed to move the tooth to complete my Ortho treatment. \n\nIn May 2013, I noticed a tiny hold in the tooth enamel, so I thought I’d get it checked out, turned out I needed the entire filling replaced. That was completed successfully; however my bite was \"off\" on one side after the filling. My bite was unstable to begin with, because my Ortho treatment didn't 100% fix my narrow upper jaw issue. Basically the new filling felt a bit high, and there was a lot of contact on my first molar (the molar next to the root canal tooth).\n\nI went back to my original dentist and she filed the tooth down slightly, it didn't really help. I was persistent on that not a lot of tooth enamel to be removed, so it could've been that.\n\nFollowing this, out of anxiety and frustration I went to another dentist and see what was happening (second opinion). She stated that I was biting hard on a few areas on the root canal tooth after doing a carbon paper test. She suggested filing down the tooth slightly. I was apprehensive, but I stupidly agreed to the filing. Now I think she's taken too much tooth enamel away - one of the cusps is almost no longer there (see photo).\n\nI straight away went to my dentist and explained what happened - she was obviously upset I went somewhere else. However, she told me not to panic and to just try and get used to the new shaped tooth. So currently my bite has been relieved slightly, however because a lot tooth enamel was removed, the bight feels deeper than before, and the first molar is somewhat bothersome still. At some point in my life I may consider getting orthodontic work again to fix my bite (I'm not sure yet though).\n\nWhat I’m asking now is: \n1) Is there any way I can rebuild the enamel that was filed down? Such as using Tooth Mousse?\n2) Should I eventually get a crown? That way I can get the normal tooth shape and cusp back?\n3) If I get a crown, is it going to make my bite worse then it is now?\n4) Should I just leave the Orthodontic band there forever and not worry about anything?\n\nYour opinions and thoughts on what has happened are greatly appreciated. I'm very upset I had the root canal tooth filed down so much. I've attached photos to see what happened."

I use that sensodyne pronamel toothpaste to try to keep my enamel from getting any worse. Now I'm afraid I am going to have to get them all pulled and get fake ones. What can I do?

Here is my dilemma:\n\nI have only three actual teeth in my upper mouth(bottoms are fine). My dentist say's I need a complete upper(certainly no argument there). Back in Dec/2012 I got the shingles, then that led to contracting bell's palsy/ramsay hunt syndrome. For those who don't know what bell's palsy/ramsay hunt syndrome is, it is paralization of one or both sides of your face, your mouth droops on one side or both, can't smile correctly, eye don't close at all. The 7th cranial nerves die then regenerate(but slowly to the tune of 1-2mm per day). It's an extremely slow healing process for alot of people(months and even years for some). My mouth is just about completely straight, but my right side of my mouth still don't raise. Now, I need full uppers, so my question is, would a dental impression not come out properly because of this? I need uppers desperately but don't want anything to come out wrong and have awful looking uppers. I think my dentist is a really cool and honest man, but I can guarantee that only a hand full of dds's in the U.S. have had this scenario and they could make a completely off decision. Any thoughts or suggestions?\n\n                                    Many Thanks:\n                                         Don"

I went in for a cleaning probably 8 months ago and they told me I had cavities forming.  to which they told me to keep flossing, and they shouldn't be an issue.  Are you kidding me? If they are already cavities, what good will that do me? Plus, I always floss and brush everyday, so it's obviously not doing me any good.  But anyway, I went back in December and they told me I had to get four teeth drilled and filled.  One of them had become pretty deep.  I went in to the dentist last Thursday for my appointment, where they numbed me and started/  I believe I received two silver, and two composite.  One on the bottom he messed up, and had to redrill and fill.    No more than 45 minutes after he stuck the novacaine needle in my mouth, I was walking out the door.  Seems pretty quick, right? But anyway, I had never had any discomfort with fillings before this.  Anything cold does not settle well, though I'm fine with hot. My gums are sore, and I get dull headaches every night.  I wake up with no headaches, and by 7 pm, I get a dull ache that lasts until I fall asleep.  I went back to the dentist, and he told me I had a \"high\", so he grinded it down to make my bite better.  He ran an X-Ray, and it shows that one filling on the bottom right, where I am having most of my discomfort, is too close to one of my other teeth.  When I floss that tooth, it just shreds the floss.  It's a pretty significant ledge between my teeth. So they scheduled another appointment to have that one redone on the 30th.  I have two more on the other side that I have to get done in February, but I plan to switch dentists before I have those done.  This current one has caused me too much trouble, and money.  By the way, this was the first set of fillings I had done with this dentist.  I went to another dentist before I found out I had cavities forming. What should I do?"

    "title": "Asymptomatic tooth with cracks/conflicting advice",
    "dialogue": "ShingleSt: Here is my situation: In 2002, on a routine dental visit, I was diagnosed with a lingual crack in one of my upper back molars, which already had a large restoration (placed in childhood and replaced in 1992 by my current dentist). He said he would watch it for a while, since it was asymptomatic. Over the course of the last 11 years, additional cracks have appeared in the buccal, distal, and as of last year, mesial parts of the tooth. My dentist has watched the tooth over the course of that time, and because it is now “a starburst pattern,” as he describes it, he would like to remove the restoration and potentially do a crown. The only reason I have hesitated in following his advice (I trust him very much) is because I have been completely asymptomatic the entire stretch of time (no biting-down sensitivity, no sensitivity to hot and cold).\n\nHis point is that the tooth will eventually crack further and definitely cause symptoms, perhaps requiring a root canal or extraction in the future. He says that a crown placed prophylactically will protect the tooth and give me potentially many more years of life for that tooth. After reading some dental-study articles online, I became more confused than enlightened. One article (a survey of the dental literature the Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry) pointed out that although it is well-accepted practice to crown all cracked teeth, there is no evidence in the literature to support that this positively affects outcomes. Also, another article gave detailed descriptions of various cracks in the enamel and dentin of molars after magnification; some of those categories seemed to indicate that you can have various kinds of cracks in the enamel only, which do not go into the dentin, even in restored molars (and would not necessarily require drastic action).\n\nI am pretty sure I will go ahead and have him remove the restoration, inspect what’s hiding in there (although I’m sure he won’t be using a microscope, which I take it is the tool of choice), and place a crown. However, how much possibility is that there that the trauma of removing the large filling and additional drilling will just make the situation worse, including affecting the pulp? I would not have any of these questions if I had had any symptoms up to this point. I would definitely just be going forward with the procedure."

My front tooth near enough exactly resembles the attached picture.\n\nWhat kind of treatment am I likely to need? Is it severe enough to need a crown?\n\nThanks Alinajones: Treatment option for broken front tooth\n\nIf a small portion of tooth is broken off and chipped, then dental bonding can be done to restore the tooth but if much of tooth structure is broken, then dental crown is given. Dental crown will provide strength to the tooth and will reinforce the weakened tooth structure. Before getting dental crown, you can get root canal treatment done for the tooth to avoid any problem later on. If tooth is weak, then post and core procedure should also be done before giving dental crown to provide strength to the tooth. If dental bonding is done for broken tooth, then it will eventually fracture in some time and will not last long. You can get porcelain dental crown for your broken tooth which is quite aesthetic. Porcelain dental crowns are bit expensive and if you can’t afford porcelain dental crowns, then you can get porcelain fused to metal dental crowns. PFM dental crowns are also tooth colored but they are not as esthetic as porcelain dental crowns. Get treatment done for your broken tooth asap before it breaks further. By the time, you get treatment done for broken tooth; avoid eating anything from broken tooth and maintain good oral hygiene to avoid any secondary infections."

    "dialogue": "dallasdalice: Hi folks, hoping to get a professional opinion about what my level of concern should be about now.\n\nI am relatively healthy, but had not been to the dentist for several years post-college (no insurance).  I went about a month and a half ago for a check-up/cleaning and was told I had 5 cavities that needed fillings.  I was given the option of white or silver and, when I asked, was told differences were primarily cost, durability, and cosmetic.  Since all these were back teeth, I made the seemingly practical choice of cheaper and longer lasting.\n\nSo, four weeks ago I went in and had all the fillings done in one appointment.  The dr. mentioned I might have some pain/discomfort due to swelling for a couple days after and could take OTC ibuprofen or another anti-inflammatory to help.\n\nAfter the first couple days, I noticed intense sensitivity to hot/cold and pressure from chewing (reading online, this seems to be expected, fading eventually).  Problem is, while it has decreased in intensity and is sometimes only a dull throbbing, it hasn't gone away completely...four weeks later.  \n\nSince these are all on my back teeth but distributed both sides, top and bottom, I can't avoid them while chewing.  After eating, that dull throb will set in for about half-an-hour or so.  Cold is an especially sharp pain, although I have learned to keep cold liquids away from direct contact.\n\nI'm not sure if I should be concerned and call the office to have them check on these again or not.  I now have a dental plan, but it is very limited, and any more work will be out of pocket.  I'm tempted to wait it out to see if it eventually goes away, but don't want to risk worsening any potential problems.\n\nFrom some of the reading I've done online, I know that the cold/heat sensitivity is expected initially and lasts varying degrees of time...but how long is too long?\n\nI also read about fillings that are \"high\"...mine don't hurt with a normal bite, just when I'm chewing...can someone clarify if this still might be the cause?\n\nI also read something about the amalgam will sometimes deteriorate around the edges, lengthening the sensitivity period, but as the material fills in that gap it should be fine...but the website wasn't quite clear and not sure how reputable...so more info there would be helpful.\n\nSorry for the length!  Help is GREATLY appreciated.\n\nAlice Surgident: Alice, posting new x-rays would greatly help. Before placing a filling, the doctor places a non conductor material in the cavity if it is deep. it helps with the sensitivity and in long term strengthens the tooth. If the filling is only in the enamel part and resting on the enamel and dentin junction- this area is very sensitive and the filling should be replaced with at least a 0.5mm deeper one. \n\nHope it helped Alice. Try tooth paste Presyze or Clove oil until you see your dentist."

I decided against an implant because of cost and the fact that i wanted a better appearance for my teeth anyway. I must admit i started regretting the decision as the dentist was grinding away at two of my natural teeth and thatd they'd be ruined forever but all i could think about was that at least they'd finally look straight. I was wrong. The impressions they took obviously showed my canine tooth (the one they grinded to a nub) was crooked and kind of turned a bit, yet they told me they were going to make my porcelain crown identical and crooked as it was in my mouth. Is this normal procedure? I was hoping they'd make the crown look better and straight instead of making it identical to my already crooked tooth."

    "dialogue": "parneye: Hello All\n\nThank you for reading my post.\n\nThis year I've had a lot of dental work (several fillings, and have also had my wisdom teeth removed..) I am 30 years old.\n\nOn one of my teeth (upper left 1st molar), I had a filling where the dentist used a metal ring (not sure of the medical term) to help with the filling, and then after the filling a tool which I could best describe as similar to a rivit gun that kind of clipped on to the metal ring and hammered the tooth to remove the metal ring. {this was in contrast to all my other fillings she performed, where the helper ring was made of plastic and gently removed with some tool}.\n\nMy question is regarding this tooth (upper left 1st molar) on the lingual side looks grey when I look in the mirror with no light, but when I shine a light on it, the tooth on the lingual side looks white... the front side of the tooth looks white under all conditions. I'm pretty sure most of the lingual side of the tooth is the filling material.\n\nI don't think I have any pain, if any it is fairly minimal, but it is currently hard to tell as I had my wisdom teeth out just over a week ago and there is still residual pain from that operation.\n\nI went to the dentist today to remove the stitches from oral surgery and I voiced my worry about the color of the tooth.... She inspected the tooth under the dental light, and also with the light pointed away and said the tooth looks fine.... I am not sure if she could see the grey I was referring to as the conditions of the lighting of the room may not have been the same as when I can see it.\n\nMy question is two fold, 1) would the tooth look grey even under a dental light if it was dead, and 2) should I take it further and ask for an xray, or be confident with the diagnosis from the dentist that the tooth is okay?\n\nI hope I explained myself well enough.\nThank you very much for reading my post."

My dentist had me bite on a blue carbon-like paper after, to see where the high points on the fillings were to file them down. But during this, he also filed down the outside point on the tooth right in front - I think it's my first molar. Now my bite feels funny on that side, like there's more pressure on that not-filled tooth. It's not really painful, just uncomfortable. I went back to the dentist, but he says there's nothing wrong. In fact, he said that I was probably one of those patients that just had \"more sensitive receptors\" or something like that, so I'm more finicky about my bite. This kind of sounded like BS... Should I adjust to this difference in bite? Or should I go to someone else? I'm very worried that I now have a permanent problem! ladyionuin: It seems like maybe the filling is too large, so is causing the tooth in front to be pushed slightly forward - so now it's aligning wrong. I don't know if that's possible, but that's kind of what it feels like. I can't floss between these teeth because they're so tight now, even though the fillings were on top and not on the side.\n\nAny insight anyone can provide is greatly appreciated please!"

    "dialogue": "HardyHar: I have a bit of a unique situation.\n\nAbout 5 years ago, I had a tooth crowned (#20). At the time, my dentist thought I'd need a root canal from looking at the x-ray. I wasn't having any pain in the tooth at all. When he cleaned out the decayed portion of the tooth, at which point he said he could see what I believe he called the pulp head. He asked if I was having any pain a that point, to which I replied that I was not. He told me we could do a root canal or he could put some medicine on it and it might heal. At the time, I was about to go on a trip, so he advised the medicine for now with a temp crown and he would re-assess when I came back in a few weeks.\n\nWhen I came back, I still wasn't having any pain so he decided to just put a crown on the tooth.\n\nFast forward 5 years. I've since moved and have a new dentist, who I trust and think is great. She was redoing some of my previous fillings from when I was young and found a lot of decay under one on #19, so much so that a crown was required. After the tooth was prepped and I was sent home with my temporary crown, I started having hypersensitivity in #20, my tooth that was crowned 5 years ago. It REALLY hurt if I bit down on it even a little. I called my dentist and she told me to give it a couple days and if it persisted, to come right in. After a day the pain started to go away and after 3 days it felt back to normal. BUT... I noticed it seemed to be slightly loose. I wasn't sure so I told my dentist about it when I came back for my permanent crown.\n\nShe took a look at it and sure enough the tooth was slightly loose. Her first thought was that the crown was loosened when she was working right next to it on #19. She tugged and wiggled it slightly to see if it would become more loose (no pain when she did so), which it didn't. She then took an x-ray, from which she could tell that the ligament looked a little loose. She told me that it was most likely from the trauma of working on the other tooth and that it should tighten back up to keep and eye on it and if it got worse to call her to set up an appt.\n\nThis was about 3 months ago and the tooth seems to be in the same state. Still slightly loose and still no pain.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Do I possibly have an abscess that's causing the looseness.\n\n2. Is it possible I'm not having any pain since this tooth has never hurt to begin with (even when faced with a root canal)?\n\n3. Should I go see my dentist immediately?\n  A. If so, am I looking at a root canal or possibly (gulp) an extraction?\n       1. If it's a root canal, is it likely the crown, which is porcelain fused to metal, can be saved (drilled through or pulled off)?\n\nPersonally, I'm getting a little worried, as I really don't want to think about an extraction or the cost associated with a bridge (and having to redo the crown I JUST got on 19). My spouse thinks I making too much of it.\n\nThanks so much. HardyHar: Anyone have any ideas?

I just moved to a new city so this was a new dentist to me.\n\nDuring the procedure one wouldn't numb, so after 2 injections I said to just do it and get it over with. (this would also be my first experience with the \"Water-lase\", it wasn't as zippy as it sounds, it sounded more like he was breaking rocks in my mouth..but i digress).\n\nLeaving the office I was already in a bit of pain, and as the novicane wore off I was in even more. That night I was in complete agony.  The following couple days my teeth were extremely sensitive to hot and cold, and hurt to chew. I went back into my dentist to have him check things over, he said everything was fine.  I've had a lot of fillings and have never felt this way afterwards before.  So I decided to go to my old dentist today and he took a look, he adjusted the bite and said to give it a week or two to see if it gets better. Explained a few scenerios..some of which terrify me.\n\nOk, so that brings us to tonight, 5 days after the initial procedure.I am now able to chew without pain, and the heat/cold sensitivity is calming down quite a bit. But the symptoms I do have are a dull irritating ache through my whole jaw, my bottom jaw hurts more than my top sometimes and no work was even done there.  Sometimes it hurts up to my ears, and if I blow my nose or bend down I can hear crackling..so strange to me.  Is there a possibility that he did the injection wrong and it bruised my jaw?  I know nerve damage is a possibility, but both sides hurt, top and bottom, is he that bad of a dentist that he killed the nerves in both teeth? What are the chances?\n\nI just dont know what to do, I'm beyond scared of the thought of having to get a root canal or extraction, on top of that I can't afford it.

After that you are looking at a denture. Fixed bridges make absolutely no sense. Destroying good teeth to fill spaces is an extremely risky proposition to begin with, but what your dentist won't tell you is the myriad of problems that can occur:\n\n1. if you damage one of the crowns you most likely must replace the entire bridge\n2. if you get a cavity under the bridge you are positively screwed\n3. bridges place a tremendous amount of stress on your roots and greatly increase the likelihood of one of your other teeth failing\n4. bridges are terribly painful and expensive to replace\n5. upper bridges grind down teeth below them like a soap stone\n6. when your bridge fails (and it WILL fail eventually), your only real option will be extraction of your remaining roots and a partial denture.\n\nKEEP YOUR NATURAL TEETH ALWAYS!

Obviously not everyone is a candidate.\n\nTooth Replacement with Dental Implants\n\nDental Implants | AAOMS.org\n\nBone loss is going to occur with bridges and partials. Neither option is perfect and each have their own trade-offs. It's an inevitable fact and you will end up losing more and more remaining teeth as the bone loss continues. The primary reason for bridge failure is poor hygiene which needs to be taken care of and decay between the bridge and supporting teeth which makes it imperative to visit a dentist regularly for cleanings and checkups. Pressure the bridge causes on the joining teeth can also cause them to crack. This can be compounded by periodontal disease, diabetes, and other disease. \n\n\nDental Bridge Multiple Teeth Replacements Single Tooth Bridgework Pros and Cons Ask The Dentist\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBridgework has been known to fail in 2-3 years ... but has also been known to last 25 years and more.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nBridgework Failure Chicago IL Dental Bridge Repair Replacement Fixing Bad Bridges Teeth Replacement Illinois\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIt is not uncommon for bridgework to last up to 30 years or more.

This sounds like an industry sponsored \"study and I would be extremely skeptical of any studies that claim fixed bridges save your other teeth. I don't see how that is possible when you must destroy natural teeth to be fitted for them in the first place. As far as remaining teeth are concerned, the exact opposite happened in my case and several other people I know because bridges place stress on your roots and eventually cause them to fail as mine did. \n\nTooth Replacement with Dental Implants\n\nDental Implants | AAOMS.org\n\nBone loss is going to occur with bridges and partials. Neither option is perfect and each have their own trade-offs. It's an inevitable fact and you will end up losing more and more remaining teeth as the bone loss continues. The primary reason for bridge failure is poor hygiene which needs to be taken care of and decay between the bridge and supporting teeth which makes it imperative to visit a dentist regularly for cleanings and checkups. Pressure the bridge causes on the joining teeth can also cause them to crack. This can be compounded by periodontal disease, diabetes, and other disease. \n\n\nDental Bridge Multiple Teeth Replacements Single Tooth Bridgework Pros and Cons Ask The Dentist\nBridgework Failure Chicago IL Dental Bridge Repair Replacement Fixing Bad Bridges Teeth Replacement Illinois\nI haven't seen any information from dentists leading anyone to believe that a bridge will last a lifetime. Permanent bridge only means it is permanently bonded to your teeth.\n\nThis should be obvious, but what you find dentists saying from an online study and what they tell their patients in their office are rarely the same. My dentist told me my bridge would last a lifetime. My mother's dentist also told her the same thing and my friend also heard this from his dentist. \n\n\nRemovable partial dentures would be my last option as they have been shown to either increase tooth loss greater than a fixed bridge or at least didn't help the survival rate of remaining teeth like fixed bridges have been shown to do.\n\nPlease explain to me how destroying your natural teeth for a fixed bridge somehow results in less tooth loss than a partial denture that fills in spaces and requires no teeth to be destroyed. If saving your existing teeth is your priority, then why in the name of god would you choose a bridge that requires you to destroy good teeth over a partial that doesn't destroy any?\n\nSurvival Rates of Teeth Adjacent to Treated and Untreated Posterior Bounded Edentulous Spaces\n\nResearch Shows That Not Replacing a Missing Tooth Increases Risk of Losing More Teeth\n\nI would be interested in seeing any information that would contradict this and indicate that partial dentures will result in a higher percentage of tooth survival over a fixed bridge.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\n\nMy own personal experience contradicts that and what part of PARTIAL DENTURES DON'T REQUIRE YOU TO DESTROY YOUR NATURAL TEETH are you not comprehending? The difference is with a partial you're not out your OTHER teeth as well. If I had gone with a partial as a child I would only be worrying about 2 or under worse case scenario maybe 4 missing teeth right now instead of the SIX missing teeth I am currently dealing with. \n\nDo you think its just a coincidence that these industry sponsored studies all show the most expensive treatments (bridges and implants) supposedly save your remaining teeth the most? How absurd is this comment?\n\n“Many times consumers will choose to replace a missing tooth with a removable partial denture because it is the least expensive option. In the long run however, removable partial dentures may be more costly due the loss of adjacent teeth and the need for future replacements.\"\n\nYou notice he never mentions anything about the destroyed teeth under a fixed bridge. So those teeth don't need replacing? I guess walking around with nubs where your tooth used to be is perfectly okay as long as there's a root attached. yeesh. \n\nYou can cut and paste links off the web until the end of time but I will continue to trust my own personal experience and the experiences of others. Destroying your natural teeth to fill spaces is a bad idea any way you slice it. sqwerl: The abutment teeth aren't automatically \"destroyed.\" Even if the bridge has to be removed and the \"nubs\" capped, you are still better off than losing those teeth leading to further bone loss. Will the capped teeth need to be pulled eventually? Maybe, probably, who knows but the studies suggest those teeth will last longer being ground down for a bridge than even being left alone with a partial.\n\nIssues with abutment teeth under a bridge SHOULD be able to be detected with regular checkups. Whether someone doesn't do that or they just have a bad dentist like you is something no one can control but the patient. That's why the life of bridges are often lower than even I realized but you know what?  I know how well I took care of my first bridge and I know I will continue to do that and I can EXPECT a life of 5-10 years if not longer. And my abutment teeth were not ruined with my first bridge and I don't expect them to be ruined by this bridge. I've seen no evidence to suggest that all second bridges will last less time than the first as you claim either. \n\nThat is my own personal experience just like yours. Neither one of us are experts but at least I sought research to find info instead of relying only on my personal experiences to hopefully give someone less biased advice than you. If you can find a study to suggest partials make teeth last longer and lead to less bone loss than bridges that would be OK too because I would really like to know."

    "dialogue": "Kenneth: In Jan of this year I had the upper right second molar (2) removed which was broken off last year. The first molar (1) also had a large filling which fell out. The dentist talked me into getting a bridge. \n\nI wasn't able to chew with the temporary bridge because it hurt. Told the dentist numerous times. He said the permeant bridge would be better. Did not have cold sensitivity. \n\nPermeant bridge was glued in with temporary cement in mid March. Even though my mouth was numb it hurt. Told the dentist that is felt really tight and not comfortable. He said give it a few days. Still can't chew on it and cold drinks are very painful. \n\nDentist adjusted by grinding down parts of bridge. Still painful. Sent me to a Endodontist. She recommends getting a root canal in tooth (1) and (3) through the bridge. She said the teeth have needed it for quite some time and it's just a coincidence the same day that I got the permanent bridge that cold sensitivity started. \n\nI'm not really buying into this.  Any insight into this?  What type of dentist should I go to for a second opinion? sqwerl: If the teeth were already hurting when you got the temporary bridge, there's a possibility that you do need the root canals. The cold sensitivity could be compounded by the material of the bridge. Without knowing what it's made of, if it's PFM (porcelain fused to metal) the metal may be more sensitive to cold and magnify the pain. Or the root/tooth condition could have just gotten worse over time.\n\nI needed a root canal under my PFM bridge and it made my mouth much more cold sensitive until the root canal was done and the pain eventually went away.\n\nI would highly recommend getting a second even third opinion from Dentists and Endodontists and demand satisfaction from whomever you choose to use."

    "dialogue": "sqwerl:I had a permanently cemented bridge installed less than a year ago and it has chipped and cracked on one tooth. I can see the chip well and the crack hasn't separated; I can just slightly feel it with my fingernail and see it. I didn't abuse the bridge or have any hard impact, I was just eating as normal. Could there be any kind of lab warranty on this since it is less than a year old and should my insurance help? It was done at the office of a well-known and respected dentist. I know I need to talk to her office ASAP but I'm really worried right now. I had to pay $1200 out of pocket and I can't possibly pay that again as I won't have that finance amount paid off until a few months. Thanks in advance.jessica:Bridge should not break so soon. You have to refer to your dentist for this. He will remove the bridge and will send it to the lab for repair. For the time being, avoid eating from that side of the bridge and maintain good oral hygiene to avoid any gum infections.sqwerl:I went to my dentist a couple of days after my first post. She agreed the bridge shouldn't have broken so soon and that maybe it didn't have the full integrity it should. She ground down just enough of the porcelain bridge to fit me with a porcelain veneer. There was no need to remove the entire bridge. She said that even if the lab were to charge her she wouldn't charge me. I just worry that if this were to happen a couple of years down the road I would probably have to pay what my insurance wouldn't pay which is usually a lot of money. I may try to get some supplemental insurance.Thomas Bird:I am 44 and have been through two bridges in my life my friend, and I hate to be the bearer of bad news but you are in for a long road of dental problems. Dentists like doing bridges because they are very profitable for them. They can charge a lot of money per crown for a minimal amount of work and it’s very good for them. Unfortunately for the patient, it is a miracle if you get 10 years out of a bridge with no problems. They put a tremendous amount of stress on your roots leaving you with a removable denture as your only option when the bridge eventually fails. All you are doing with a bridge is trading one set of dental problems today for an even greater set of dental problems tomorrow. The teeth you have capped now will sooner or later need to be pulled entirely and replaced with a partial removable denture and there is simply no way around that fact.sqwerl:Some dentists are better than others just like doctors, nurses, or anyone that provides a service. Did the same dentist do both of your bridges? Was it a PFM (porcelain fused to metal) or pure porcelain bridge? PFM bridges are stronger. Did you take care of your bridge by flossing under it every day and flossing around the real teeth on both ends of the bridge? How many teeth did you have bridged? If it were quite a few teeth then the bridge would put a lot of strain on the end teeth and there may have been better options. Other than that, there shouldn't have been a reason for you to have problems out of the capped end teeth. There are no sure things dealing with teeth, so telling me without a doubt my capped teeth will eventually need to be pulled may or may not be true. Telling someone your problems will eventually become their problems is just a blanket statement and flat out guess. Yes, there are tradeoffs to bridges but depending on your own dental situation it may or may not be worth it to go with a removable partial. When I was 13, I had my front left tooth totally knocked out and I had a removable partial until I was 17 when my teeth had matured enough to be fit with a 3-unit bridge. I wouldn’t trade the 17 years I had no problems and kept that annoying partial for anything in the world. Dentists have to make profit to stay in business and the lab has to profit as well. My two partials were not cheap either. They are so annoying to deal with. You should take them out every night and have to soak them in denture solution. Then, even if you use denture adhesive and actually get it to stay well, you still can’t bite into things as well. They often come loose and you have to reglue or go with it loose until the next day. Food gets impacted around its edges, maybe up under it, and you have a piece of plastic you can constantly feel inside your mouth. I had a new partial made which I kept for six months this time around and couldn’t wait to get a bridge. I HATE partials. You’re bad experience doesn’t mean everyone will have a \"long road of dental problems.\" To each his own and if you prefer partials that’s fine. It seems like you are hell-bent on pushing your thoughts on others. Anyone with missing teeth is going to have dental problems which will probably continue as more bone loss occurs, regardless of whether you have a bridge or partial. You’re wrong about bridges and partials being the only options. Implants are also an option. Very, very expensive but you normally get a bone graft if you’ve had any bone loss due to missing teeth and rods are implanted into the bone to which \"teeth\" can be attached. These often look less natural than bridges, though. My insurance only pays half on bridges so if you feel the price is too high, take out supplemental insurance if possible. It sounds like you either have an axe to grind with a dentist that did a poor job or feel like you were price gouged.sqwerl:I had two different dentists do each bridge and I have never met anyone with a bridge who had never had problems with their bridge so spare me the \"every case is different BS.\" I had a 6-crown bridge which means they destroyed 4 of my natural teeth to fill in two spaces and it was a HUGE mistake. After implants and bone grafts and two bridges I developed a degenerative root condition which my current dentist here in Thailand informed is quite common for patients who have had bridges for many years as your roots are not meant to carry the amount of stress placed on them by fixed bridges. I have lost both my front teeth and nearly lost my canine roots as well. You should NEVER mess around with your canines period unless you want to risk looking like Popeye the rest of your life. My bridge problems had nothing to do with the quality of the dentist or whether I flossed regularly or not. It had to do with the fact that bridges are a TEMPORARY FIX and left me with more problems than I started with. I am wrong about a partial being the only option after your bridge fails?? YOU are wrong and you are living in a dream world. So what are people supposed to do about the destroyed teeth under the bridge? Yank them out and put in 3 or 6 implants?? Are you out of your mind? What happens if those fail? So what you're suggesting is exactly what I am saying: To fix a space, get a bridge and pray it doesn’t have any problems for a decade, get another one for another insane amount of money after that and pray REALLY hard that one lasts more than 5 years, and then spend your life savings letting another crooked American dentist reconstruct your entire jawbone in the form of extractions and steel implants and pray REALLY REALLY hard those don’t have any problems... and then probably end up with a partial denture anyway. Sounds great! I’m sure the American dental industry is quite grateful to have delusional apologists like yourself around. You seem to have an axe to grind against partials, when in reality a bridge is just as much of a hassle as you cannot eat with them any more than you can with a partial and they are much harder to keep clean. God help you if you should get a cavity inside of one. And what happens if you damage a crown? Lucky you get to fork over more money for an entire new bridge. I wouldn’t wish a bridge on my worst enemy; they are the biggest ripoff in the history of dentistry. And before ANYONE deals with the American insurance/dental racket I would advise getting work done overseas. It’s cheaper, the dentists are more ethical and better skilled. The reality of bridges is they are incredibly expensive, incredibly RISKY, and a temporary fix that trades one set of dental problems today for an even greater set of dental problems tomorrow. There is simply no getting around that reality. But I guess it fits right in with that whole \"to hell with tomorrow\" attitude many Americans seem to have.sqwerl:You keep claiming how emotional I am and crying about ad hominem attacks and blanket statements, but you won’t address directly any of my points. I could care less whether you think I am objective or credible or not. Facts are facts and the facts are that bridges are a deal with the devil. Are you denying that bridges rarely last more than 10 years without problems? Are you denying your options after that are little more than dentures? American dentists are a small step above chiropractors. Actually they may be even worse. Don’t believe me? Go onto almost any website for any dentist you can find that does bridges and see if they warn patients about the very high possibility of the problems that I have already stated. Do you really think a dentist trying to sell you a bridge is going to tell you about the high risk of root damage? Or that if you damage one crown the whole bridge will probably need to be replaced? Or that your replacement bridge after your current fails will probably not last even half as long as the original?? I’m not even getting into all the work required to maintain them, and I would bet money they actually are aware of that reality but choose to gloss over it. Instead they focus on the $5000-$8000 price tag for an entire set of bridges and crowns they are trying to sell. There’s a reason why so many people end up with partials or even removable dentures after their bridge fails. The fact is bridges are NOT a long-term solution to missing teeth and Americans are just fooling themselves if they think otherwise."

However nearly every dentist in America is trying to sell you one of those pieces of garbage so I'm sure it would be difficult to get one of them to admit to that. The truth is you will be lucky if you get 7 years out of the second bridge let alone 17 because your roots are not meant to handle that kind of stress.

    "title": "Smell from a new dental crown",
    "dialogue": "MissK11: I got a new crown about a month ago. When I massage my gums, I smell and taste something bad emanating from the crown area. It's not a very strong taste or smell but it really bothers and worries me. I do not remember but I think the tooth had a cavity that was filled before the crown was placed upon it. I told my dentist about the smell and he says that I am one of those patients that has bacteria and that's just the way it is. He says it happens through the nose where the air runs to my mouth and feeds the bacteria that causes the bad smell. I don't have any nose problem, sinusitis or sinus infection so I don't know what he is talking about!!!! I didn't have bad breath before. He also says the smell has nothing to do with the crown and that I have to floss and use mouthwash. I brush my teeth after each meal, floss often and no matter how much mouthwash I use, I still taste and smell something wrong. I just don't want to hear in the near future that I have gum disease because my dentist didn't take care of the problem. What can cause the bad taste from the crown?"

    "dialogue": "Iverson dental labs: As a dentist, what is your professional opinion on the use of amalgam fillings, do you feel that the constant release of mercury, though trace amounts, throughout the patients life could have no detrimental effects. Although it hasn't been proven that these fillings create health problems, its a well known fact that mercury is a poisonous element and knowing that your filling is essentially leaking trace amounts of it, do you feel that it is 100% safe?"

This may sound strange but..recently if i poke the tooth/surrounding gum with my tongue i can feel the something sort of clicking & wobbling inside (feels like could be the posts that were put up there) is this normal? \nsince last week..there is now a v.small sharp point on the inner of my gum i guess about a millimetre from the root canal tooth..i've tried but cannot really get a good angle to see it myself..but my partner looked and thought maybe its a tiny bit of tooth. but i'm concerned it's one of the thin posts from the root canal has moved and poked through my gum! .. is this at all possible? \nNot to sound to mean .. but the dentist that did the root canal is new to my dental surgery and she admitted that she was rushing because she was behind with patients..worrying maybe she didnt do something right. the point hurts if i poke it with my finger but not when i eat or anything but it is annoying and uncomfortable. \nAnd the filling of the root canal tooth came out with-in a few weeks and i had it replaced at an emergency dentist a day later with a temporary filling which is still in there a month or so since.\ncan someone help?? do i go to the dentist? \nthanks,\nGeorgina"

    "dialogue": "Bex113: I just had two crowns put in (I think teeth 9 and 10).  The crowns feel like they are thicker than my natural teeth (front to back) and they feel different than my natural teeth when I feel the back of the crowns with my tongue.  They look fine otherwise.  I was wondering if this was normal or should my crowns be the exact same size and shape of my natural teeth?"

    "dialogue": "jpg: I need help on a very touchy subject. a piece of my life that hurts to deal with.\n\n2 years ago I went to the dentist for a check up and the xrays showed I had a line in between a root canel filling. The dentist wanted to redo the feeling and it had a post. He quoted me to take the crown of and redo the feeling and put a new crown on. after the crown and all was taken off he never redid the feeling so I said whats up? he gave me some lame reason and credited me for not doing the work. Now 2 years after him having done that work my crown is slightly loose.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nI am seriously thinking of taking this a step further than having him fix it. This is serious bad work and I not happy at all. I had to open a care credit for this work and am paying way to much money. This is going to be a serious case here. \n\nany thoughts and help? This could be and Who knows I might loose my tooth as I read.\nI even feel he did bad work so I go back and he makes more money.\n\nHelp. please."
