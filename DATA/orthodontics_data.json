    "dialogue": "christianlee: Hi All,\n\nMy orthodontic treatment has come to the final phase of fine tuning. My orthodontist asked if I'm satisfied with the current state, and if I have any other concerns.\n\n(1) The main thing I want to improve is that the top midline seems a bit asymmetrical, and that the top right central incisor (my right, FDI 11) seems a bit more tipped towards the midline than the top left central incisor (FDI 21). My ortho told me that from what he sees (visually, not by x-ray), the root is currently approximately in its neutral/straight position, and that if I decide to rotate it, then it might go slightly away from this neutral/straight position. Even if this estimate was true, would it be a concern to have the tooth slightly off from neutral/straight to achieve better midline symmetry, and do you think I should go ahead with rotating this tooth (top right central incisor) by what seems to be a little bit?\n\n(2) Any other fine tuning suggestions?\n\nThanks,\nCL Dr M: What is the plan for after the ortho has been completed? What I can see from your photo is that the one central incisor seems chipped and that there is also some black triangles present between the upper incisors. You can perhaps consider crowns or veneers in order to eliminate the black triangles, improve the chip and achieve your desired aesthetic outcome, without tilting the root out of its neutral position, which might increase the risks of relapse at a later stage.\nIf you want to keep it as non-invasive as possible, you can also consider resin veneers."

It suggests a minor adjustment could be the answer. Adding a small amount of composite resin to your molars, similar to what you experience with food getting stuck, could be a possible solution.\n\nGood luck with your appointment!

    "dialogue": "Haroja: Hello. I received orthodontic treatment between 2019-2022. Two teeth were extracted in my upper jaw and screws were placed in the roots of my front incisors, allowing my teeth to move upward. After my treatment was completed, retaining wires were glued to my lower and upper jaw. I used the night plate every night for 6 months. After the 6th month, I started using it every 2 nights for 3 months. After using it for 9 months, my night plate broke. I didn't go to my dentist and get a night plate again, thinking that using it for 9 months would be enough. . While I was eating, the adhesive on the retainer wire on my upper jaw came off. When the gap between my teeth started to open, I noticed it and went to my dentist. The adhesive was reapplied. \nCan you comment on the alignment of my teeth after the treatment is completed and the alignment of my current teeth? The teeth in my upper right jaw turned slightly inward. Can fillings be placed between my teeth? Is there a need for orthodontic treatment again? If I undergo orthodontic treatment again, how many months do you think it will take? Thank you Dr M: On the photo it is unclear if there was relapse. If the retainers were not worn or replaced when broken, there is a a high likelihood that your teeth moved.\nIf the changes are relatively small, you can consider aligner therapy, which is not as long as normal fixed braces, in order to align the teeth again. \nIt is my opinion that retainers should be worn every night after ortho has been completed, to prevent relapse, and I advise my patients as much. Haroja: Thanks for responding. What is aligner treatment? Unfortunately, I do not have a night plate, but I have retainers on both jaws. Dr M: You can google Invisalign to get a clearer picture. It is different sets of retainers, that is designed in such a way that it moves your teeth gradually. Haroja: Thank you for the answer. I think my teeth are crooked by 1 or 2 millimeters.

    "dialogue": "confusedandscared: I went to a dentist for extreme tooth pain/sensitivity in several molars. I get mild, brief pain when any food or drink touches the area between those teeth, and if the food or drink is hot, cold, or extremely sweet, forget it--the pain will almost bring me to tears (though it lasts only a few seconds). This pain/sensitivity started about 6 months ago and only got worse. I'm 24 years old and female. I don't smoke or drink. I floss daily and brush 2x/day for a while now.\n\nThe doctor performed the cold test, and I had sharp pain, lasting about 3 seconds. He looked at my X-rays and found that I had signs of external resorption in 3 molars. (Although almost all of my teeth have developed similar sensitivity to lesser degrees. He only took X-rays of the ones that were hurting the most.) He referred me to an endodontist that I will be seeing in 2 days.\n\nAfter googling what external resorption means, I'm freaking out. Most sources are saying that in the majority of cases, the teeth will need to be extracted, which is alarming since all of my teeth have developed the same sensitivity/pain to varying degrees. My dentist couldn't answer why the resorption occurred and said it could be idiopathic.\n\nI've never had trauma. I did braces from about 2013-2015 and Smile Direct Club invisible aligners from about 2017-2019. I've been wearing my retainers nightly since completing my last alignment treatment. Throughout the day, my teeth will shift slightly and putting on the retainers at night will be a bit tight/painful. I explained all of this to my dentist and he said it's unlikely that an orthodontic treatment I completed years ago and/or the retainers are causing the resorption and he said that the mild shifting throughout the day is normal as some people have faster relapse speeds than others.\n\nAs of about a month, I also developed some other symptoms I believe may be related like occasional, mild ear and jaw pain (ears will feel mildly painful pressure, jaw is more of an ache and stiffness. I'll have the urge to open wide and stretch it out) and random, brief numbness or pain in my hands and feet 10-20 times a day. Both the facial pain and bodily numbness occur on both sides of my body, but more on the left, which is also where I experience more dental pain.\n\nPlease help, I'm really at a loss. Dr M: Do you have any x-rays that you could share that indicates the external resorption? confusedandscared: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDo you have any x-rays that you could share that indicates the external resorption?\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nWill get them to you tomorrow after my endodontic appointment!

These are teeth 18, 19, and 30, I believe. She said she doesn't see any external resorption and it might've been artifacts on the previous dentist's X-rays. She said the extreme pain/sensitivity I feel might be from a wisdom tooth that just erupted and 2 cavities in the very back molars, 1 on each side. I asked her if a wisdom tooth/cavity could cause pain in teeth that aren't adjacent, or on teeth above, and she said yes. We're gonna get the wisdom extracted and cavity filled and see if that does the trick.\n\nHowever, the borders of some of my roots still look fuzzy/gone completely (eg right side of first pic), and this is what the previous dentist thought was resorbed. What do you think? Thanks so much. Dr M: No signs of resorption can be seen here. Have your wisdom teeth extracted and see how it goes. confusedandscared: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNo signs of resorption can be seen here.

    "title": "Questions on Mewing in relation to Orthodontics/Night Guards",
    "dialogue": "Electric Boobs: It took me a while to realise the obvious, but if mewing slowly widens your palate over time, then am I right in saying there's ultimately no point in someone - who as a retainer or night guard - to do mewing if their hope is to enhance their facial profile. Apart from the health benefits of mewing, if it's not possible to widen one's palate, then I guess the only other aesthetic benefit to mewing would be that you support your upper face.\n\nSo in the case of myself, I can think of it as that during the day while mewing I'd be forcing my teeth outwards, and then my night guard would push in the opposite direction to this during the night. So there would be an ongoing battle?\n\nIn this video from the 6:00 mark Dr Mike Mew emphasises that it's important that habits supporting the 'inner U' to go in balance with habits that support the 'outer U'. It made me wonder, what if someone were to just mew for the 'inner U' without doing chewing excises for the 'outer U', or vis versa? If you were to do all mewing and nothing for the jaw, then could that mess up one's bite?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy other question, is that I've had invisalign so I've had a small amount of IPR. If my smile were instead perfected by making space for the teeth, then the orthodontist would need to widen my upper and lower palate, giving me a heathier looking face. Dr Mike Mew used an image with a almost identical to the fourth one attached below, to demonstrate what a perfect looking arch should look like. So if I wanted my arch to be perfect like that one, then this would involve introducing gaps between my teeth. So if I wanted this done, would those gaps needs to be filled with composite? Mike Mew claims that this can be done on most individuals under the age of 40. Below are three images of my own (before and after for the lower, and after for the upper). The invisalign has widened my arch a very small bit at the front only. But invisalign doesn't seem to have the ability to move the molars.\n\nAnother question I have, is that a lot of videos on youtube seem to indicate that mewing improves the jawline, which confuses me slightly. Am I right in saying that mewing is for the inner U and has little influence on the jawline? I would also like to know more about these functional appliances, and are there many orthodontists that use them?"

My teeth are crooked with slight gaps but my bite is normal. However, the orthodontist said that the only way to get straight teeth in my situation was to align all my teeth and especially my two central incisors together but leave two gaps between my two central incisors and my lateral incisors, then to get ceramic dental fillings over the gaps to make it neat and straight. Is it seriously not possible to have straight teeth by just getting metal braces without having to go through a second procedure to make it straight? The orthodontist told me it was because he usually pushes the teeth in in order to make it straight, but since my bite was normal, he couldn't just push it in. My teeth are slightly smaller in size but I've seen videos of other people with smaller teeth than me that still got straight teeth through braces. This orthodontist charges more for braces than other orthodontists so I want to make sure its seriously not possible to avoid going through dental fillings just to get a good smile before I make my decision, I really thought my situation was simple and can be solved with just braces \nThank you for reading this.

I had braces during this time so my dentist decided to close the gap (using elastics iirc). I was almost done with my braces but this gap closure delayed it for a few months. My bite was uncomfortable for a while but it religned as if my second molar was my first.\n\nI still did not have my wisdom tooth come in during this time. It come out a year later and took the place of where my second molar used to be.\n\nNow, my braces are about to be taken off. The lower and upper teeth create a perfect aligned arch. When seen through the Y plane it looks perfect. The problem is in the bite.\n\nThe gap closure made the top-right half of my palate narrower? When I feel the roof of my mouth with my tongue, the right side (where the gap was closed) always feels narrower than the left, as if the teeth were pulled in.\n\nWhen i bite, only the left half of my teeth make actual contact. The top set of the right half feel raised upwards, creating an open bite. Even if i shift my jaw. the right side never fully bites. This is also visually evident.\n\nI am most concerned with the assymetry of my face ever since. The right side of my face looks like it had melted downwards. The cheek is much more sunken on the right side, there is a deep nasalobial fold only on the right side, my smile droops down on the right side, and my jaw is also drooped.\n\nMy dentist says that the bite is already perfect and there is nothing more to be done. The prolonged stay of brackets on my teeth are causing more dental problems (such as cavities) but i am debating whether the brackets can still be used to correct my facial asymmetry (with another dental professional).\n\nAlso it may be important to note that i just recently got the lower-right 1st premolar extracted as well. I think i may have broken both the upper and lower teeth chewing on something hard before and both succumbed to cavities. Though, i will never close the gap this time and just have a false tooth attached to my permanent retainers to avoid my second molar sinking into the open space.\n\nIs there still anything to be done? Or is the asymmetry irreversible? Thanks in advance to anyone who answers!\n\nlink to the photo: \n\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/jTa6m9s Dr M: There is clear asymmetry visible in the photo.

The result is overall great: bite is normal (no overbite or overjet), no spaces between teeth, smile looks great. Only issue is that while my upper and lower arches are aligned with each other, they are not aligned with my the midlines of my lips - i.e. both arches are skewed a couple mm to the side.\n\nI was offered an Invisalign plan; however, the orthodontist is not looking to use TADs for the retreatment. When I spoke to my previous orthodontist (the one from 10 years ago), he told me that the Invisalign plan looks good, but that without TADs it'd be very difficult to correct the midline discrepancy. In other words, some sort of anchorage is necessary in order to pull the arches and correct the 'skewness' / asymmetry / discrepancy (sorry, I'm not an expert when it comes to using the right medical terms).\n\nI am not sure why the current orthodontist doesn't include TADs in the plan. I understand that he doesn't want to worsen my already-pretty-good-and-satisfactory condition, but can this plan work without TADs?\n\n*I've gone to a couple of consultations.\n\nI would appreciate your insights and expertise as I need to make a decision and want to make the best decision for me.\nThank you very much! alithedentalguy: Hi,\n\nIn order to correct the midline issue (following the braces treatment) with the invisalign might brutal. The reason is to move whole jaw to correct it. Think about it, they will not extract any of the teeth and the only thing that they can do is to move the whole teeth and if they provide a gurantee that they will fix %100 go for it but the time scale will be very long. \n\nPlease keep me updated. GettingInvisalignSoon29: Thank you for your response. They are not going to extract any teeth but rather to create more spacing by IPR on a number of teeth (in the back of the jaw) thus achieving more space. My question was whether they can fix the midline without using TADs ? There is not anchoring.\n\nThanks,\n\nZack"

    "title": "Who owns STL files from orthodontic treatment / Invisalign treatment?",
    "dialogue": "Justme778899: Hello. I am new to the forums and I registered to ask a specific question the answer to which might be valuable to other people, too.\n\nAre there any orthodontists in the forum? I am trying to understand a subject matter better.\n\nI had orthodontic treatment at a dental clinic and chose Invisalign. During treatment there were two 3D mouth scans performed with an iTero scanner - the first at the beginning of the treatment, the second after the treatment with aligners was finished in order to get the data needed for my retainers to be manufactured. I opted for Invisalign brand (Vivera retainers).\n\nThe entire treatment took place in a country which is not my native country (not the US). Becoming more mindful of my finances and knowing that the retainers have to be eventually replaced I recently asked the dental clinic in which I underwent treatment to send me the STL (the 3D scan files) that were taken during treatment. The reason is that I believe in owning the data myself and being able to in the future being able to choose a contractor that manufactures spare retainers according to my own preferences which might include financial attractiveness of options as well as access to the data if I want to use it with an orthodontist in my home country.\n\nThe clinic disclosed the first file with me but told me they are unable to send me the second file (of the scan that was performed after the aligner treatment had finished). I didn‘t just accept this as an answer, yet since I do not know if this is correct, if this can be handled differently and therefore what options I have.\n\nThe clinic stated that they are unable to do so because they could not access the file as it - according to them - is blanketed under Invisalign.\n\nTechnically my understanding is the following:\n\nSince both files were taken with the same equipment and both times files had to be stored after the scan was completed both files should be equally accessible to the dental clinic In which there created. I think that is obvious.\n\nI am aware that both the dental clinic, as well as Invisalign are not likely to be cheerful that I want access to the files as it might lessen the chance that they will earn money from me in the future but I would like to know what is actually happening.\n\nI am aware that this is likely controversial. I have my interests. The clinic has their interests. Invisalign has their interests.\n\nI could argue that I paid for the treatment including the scans and therefore am entitled to receive the scan files. Invisalign could argue that the second scan was performed as part of their proprietary Vivera retainer manufacturing process and that they are under no obligation to disclose the file - just as an artisan could argue that a physical or digital model they created as part of manufacturing a commissioned work for me is their property unless agreed otherwise beforehand. The dental clinic could argue - I am not exactly sure and in any case would or will likely have to look into the contract but I would like to understand the intricacies.\n\nAre there any orthodontists who can comment on this?\n\nI can also commission a 3D scan of one of my untouched pairs of retainers and commission a retainer manufacturing contractor of my choice to create retainers from that file. I am confident that I can find a workaround but I don’t want to waste my resources. The question is: Do I have the right to owning that file? And: Is the clinic actually able to provide the file to me?\n\nObviously Invisalign earns a lot of money with re-commissions for Vivera retainers because the margin is very large. It’s part of their business model. Personally speaking, I will not throw away my money if I can commission retainers to be made that work just as well for a fraction of the cost by people who specialize in the manufacturing of such. I am - obviously - searching for a solution to minimize costs for my orthodontic maintenance - and considering the actual manufacturing and material cost of retainers I believe this is a wise choice.\n\nI‘m curious if there is anyone here who can comment on this in a qualified way. If there is, or if there are several people I would be eager to hear what you know.\n\nI‘d like to say I am not so much interested in discussing the ethical side of things. So if you have an opinion on the subject matter but cannot provide further value I would encourage you not to discuss this. Maybe there are other people interested in this question. In any case the people who could truly provide value would be those who know - likely professionally. Thank you. happy_okapi: This is unfortunate and I have the same issue. It seems your best option would be to order retainers that come with a 3D printed model. This way you'll have a physical \"copy\" of the scans, even if you don't have the scans themselves. This is what I'm doing. It's truly absurd that they don't share these files with us - I've had a week of back and forth interactions with my dentist's office just to get a replacement pair of retainers. They did give me a 3D Model when I finished treatment but it's entirely useless because they scanned me before I got my lingual wires, which are the v-loop kind and are quite bulky. If it's any consolation, most labs won't accept scans anyway unless they come directly from a doctor's office. Good luck to you! alakuni: The ownership of STL files from orthodontic or Invisalign treatment can be a source of concern, especially when it comes to your own dental health records.\n\nIn most cases, the STL files, which are digital 3D models of your teeth and mouth, are typically owned by the orthodontist or dentist who provided the treatment. However, it's essential to discuss this with your dental provider to clarify any concerns you may have about access or ownership of these files.\n\nYour dental professional should be willing to explain their policies and procedures regarding patient records and files. Transparency and open communication are essential to ensure you have a clear understanding of your own dental data, allowing you to make informed decisions about your treatment and future dental care.\n\nYour peace of mind and trust in your dental team are vital, so don't hesitate to ask questions and seek clarity on this matter. Your oral health is a personal and important part of your life, and you deserve to have a full understanding of your own dental records. joey87: Shareholders of Align Technology owns it, which is a public company making $1 billion in revenue per quarter with $1.3 billion cash on the balance sheet. Gross profit margin of 77%.\n\nAlign Technology makes $165 million per quarter from Imaging Systems. Those STL files are a gold mine."

    "title": "Sceptical of Invisalign Consent Form",
    "dialogue": "Electric Boobs: Hi,\n\nI have been comfortable with the cosmetic dentist who I've decided to have Invisalign with so far and that was one of the main reasons I haven't had a consult anywhere else. When taking impressions he said he needed to take various photographs of my teeth that he'd upload to the \"invisalign app\". The two of these photos I wasn't entirely comfortable with were a facial photo from the front and one from the side. I'm sure it would have possible to opt out from these, but in any case I let it happen. I didn't think a whole lot of this until I read a particular part of the 3 page consent & agreement form.\n\nIt reads \"I authorise my doctor to release my medical records, including, but not limited to [pretty much everything...] to other licensed dentists or orthodontists and to Align, its representatives, employees, successors, assigns, and agents for the purpose of investigating and reviewing my medical history as it pertains to ortho treatment with product(s) from Align and (ii) for educational and research purposes.\"\n\nI did a google on this to see if any others shared their suspicions. The Invisalign form that I found online (link below) seemed to be almost identical except for the end of the every last paragraph, where it read \"My medical records will only be shared with third parties if this is covered by my consent or otherwise permitted by the applicable law\".\n\nhttps://www.omniadentalspa.co.uk/pdf/invisalign-consent-form.pdf\n\nSo why is there a difference? who made it? and when? Wouldn't this be off-putting to most!\n\nI guess I don't mind photos of my teeth going about, but I don't the idea of an image of myself up in some lecture hall 10 years from now, where a lecturer is explaining teeth movements in the context of facial profile. I know some people probably have no issue with this, but it makes me reconsider the price alongside the feeling of a lack of privacy.\n\nInterestingly, on the very top of the form it says that it has to be signed by the patient prior to treatment and kept for their records, and should not be sent to Align Technology, Inc. This gives the impression that there is no way that I can go ahead with this treatment without agreeing to this.\n\nThe dentist gave me the form to take away with me, read and sign. As he gave it to me he highlighted certain parts of it, giving the impression that I need only read those parts. These were points that related to what we'd just discussed in the operating room. I hope that he wasn't hoping that I wouldn't bother reading the part I'm sceptical of. As this was my third appointment of the process so far, and as I was happy, I agreed to pay the first installment (€700) as we finished our discussion in the operating room. He wasn't even expecting me to pay until the next appointment. He told me that since I'm going ahead with it that he'd need to refer me to another clinic to get an X-ray. He didn't mention that this would be extra... that clinic called me to arrange it and it'll be €50.\n\nThe other thing is that he'd sent an email to me of the entire 3D representations of the plan, and that email (which I'd seen but not opened) has since been retracted.\n\nThanks for reading MattKW: This is normal type of consent. It is often used in many dental practices where patients have photos taken. Yes, your teeth may appear in a lecture sometime (if you're really that interesting) but personal details that are not related to treatment (name, address,...) won't be  identified. If you don't like that, then put a line through that part of the Consent and keep a copy.\nThe dentist keeps the Consent form as he is your primary provider that has discussed this with you, not Align.

    "dialogue": "Electric Boobs: Hi all,\n\nSo I need this for my top front incisors which are tilted inwards. The front left of my right incisor takes all the force when I bite. I chipped a few pieces off my right incisor (left in photo) and you can see the crack. The dentist said he needed to sand off some of the tooth on the other side in order to make create space to do the aligning, so you might notice the difference between the two photos. But what other changes could I make to my teeth while I'm at it? I wasn't actually recommended it for my bottom teeth, but I decided to go ahead with bottom aligning too, as I've a few crooked teeth there... particularly the bottom lateral incisor on the right (left in photo). After asking I was surprised to hear my dentist say that he'd be able to move teeth up and down as well. After sending off the impressions he said he'd she'd come up with a plan and that I could tweak that plan if I wanted to. He says he just needs to rotate the incisors, and that he might need to bring the teeth a bit outwards, so he mightn't need to do any IPR.\n\nMy initial thoughts were that I'd like to bring my upper teeth down a bit as they can't really be seen when I talk. It's mainly the lower teeth the show when I talk. I had to sneer (rather than smile) for the below photo. I think this is due to two reasons; firstly that I've a lip that comes further down than most, and secondly that I've grinded some of them away due to bruxism. Having a closer look at my upper teeth I realised that my lateral incisors could be brought down a bit when compared to the others. But I'm wondering could this have some sort other visual consequence that I mightn't anticipate. It would of course bring down the gum line in that area... which should be fine as I'd never really smile enough to have my gums showing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other thing is that (as I have bruxism) 20 months ago this dentist added some composite material onto my upper canines, in order to stop side-to-side grinding. I don't know if you can tell that by looking at them, but you'll notice they are a bit longer than the lateral incisors. The point being is that it gave me a thought... I'm wondering if I could ask him - to instead - do the same to my upper lateral incisors as what he did to my canines in order to give them more length. I figure if I could get my upper teeth a bit longer I might be able to get a smile like Bryan Cranston, where you don't see too much of his upper set, but you still see a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy dentist said he could do it all in about 4 months, with me visiting him once a month. So with each tray being in use for 10 days, I'd basically be seeing him every once for every 3 trays. I'm wondering does that sound quite fast, considering that I'm 34 years old? I also what this to be done in a way that will ensure my teeth are quite stable into old age.\n\nAnd in case it's relevant, here's a photo of my night guards both old and new. It's the old one that I wear as I'm afraid to wear the new one after cracking that incisor off it two months ago while sleeping.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, feel free to share any thought about how much of my teeth you think I've grinded off over the years.\n\nThank you MattKW: Impossible to say. Why not go to an orthodontist and get a more detailed analysis and possibly other options? It's worth the money for at least a consultation.\nBTW, canines are usually longer than lateral incisors, but sometimes wear down over time.

If you'd like to shed any light on the following, please do.\n\nSo in my 3rd invisalign appointment yesterday my dentist showed me his 150 day plan for the treatment. I asked him if it would be possible to do it more slowly as I'd heard (rightly or wrongly) that orthodontic treatment reduces the lifespan of teeth. He explained that there's a certain amount of bone loss during any orthodontic treatment, and that it's inconsequential. I didn't think to ask at the time, but if I lose bone in one place, then does that mean that I'll be gaining it in another? He said that if I was more comfortable that he could have it done over 200 days instead... he just clicked a button and the software displays the trays accordingly.\n\nI was under the impression that the amount of bone loss was related to the amount of time the course takes, but he then explained that the amount of bone loss is related to the amount of movement, and not the amount of time. It all sounded fine but then when I later read the agreement form and in the \"risks and inconveniences\" section it read \"the length of the roots of the teeth may be shortened during orthodontic treatment and may become a threat to the useful life of teeth\". What do you think?\n\nThanks"

MattKW: With braces, the orthodontist takes your stable altho crooked bite and tries to rearrange the teeth in a better-looking and hopefully stable bite. But no ortho will promise they will stay that way, so retainers (removable or fixed) may be necessary for the rest of your life. Or you can live with a bit of relapse. \nYou could get new suckdown retainers at a relatively minor cost which would maintain where you are right now, but you'd have to wear them every night or so."

I had a follow-up appt today with my surgeon and addressed an issue I had with my bite, left side feels 'off' like the teeth are touching/clashing when I close my mouth. Dr found that I had a slight CR-CO shift of approximately 1 mm with premature contact left premolar region. What can be done to fix this? He suggested an occlusal adjustment with my primary dentist after I am fully healed, how likely is that to resolve the issue?\n\nI'm currently wearing lass I box elastics for 2 more weeks per my surgeon's instructions and have been for the past 2 weeks now, not sure if this will help or hurt or have no effect on the shift or not. MattKW: Have you seen an orthodontist? They are more likely to diagnose and treat the residual bite discrepancy. countryrocks247: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHave you seen an orthodontist?

MattKW: I'm surprised that the surgeon sent you back to the general dentist for correction of CR-CO shift. Yes, he might be able to correct it by shaving off part of your teeth but this will damage your teeth irreversibly. Rather, an ortho should be able to analyse your bite  and probably correct it with little or no damage at all. It will cost you significantly more, but you will get a better long-term result. countryrocks247: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI'm surprised that the surgeon sent you back to the general dentist for correction of CR-CO shift.

MattKW: I don't know how significant your bite discrepancy is - maybe selective grinding will do it, maybe not. For a general dentist, it's hard to tell unless diagnostic models are taken and mounted in an articulator. Orthodontists usually have sophisticated 3D imaging software that can also do this, plus be able to plan detailed braces treatment if required."

There is also a decayed tooth in the same row as the impacted canine. One doctor said that the decayed tooth should be taken out and braces wouldn't work because of the missing canine. Another doctor said that the decayed tooth should be removed and that braces would still work. I'm not sure what to do and how to achieve a good smile.

I would firstly seek a consultation with an orthodontist. He/she would then advise you on which teeth need to be extracted, i.e wisdoms and decayed pre-molar, as part of their comprehensive treatment plan. The gap where the premolar was, could be closed orthodontically. The ectopic canine can also be brought into position with the help of a chain, if the orthodontist decides to utilize this tooth.\n\nMostly likely you are looking at fixed upper and lower braces. The correct starting point would be a consult with an orthodontist however. MattKW: You have more serious issues than the canine:\n\nYou appear to be at least 18yo. I strongly doubt that the impacted canine can be pulled down at this late age. To discuss with your orthodontist. It may also have to be extracted.\nYes, the upper right 2nd premolar is unlikely to be salvageable.\nYou appear to have many areas of decay apart that I can see on this grainy OPG (pink arrows). More detailed intra-oral Xrays are needed to be sure.\nThere appears to be deep decay happening on your lower left 2nd molar from the adjacent wisdom tooth (thick pink arrow). This 2nd molar may also be unsalvageable.\nYour wisdom teeth appear to have some decay: upper left, lower left.

    "title": "Braces/orthodontics to close UL6 first molar extraction gap?",
    "dialogue": "JamesH: I’m 42 and currently have all my adult teeth. I have a few composite fillings but have had no dental work other than that, so the prospect of losing a tooth, and an important one at that, is pretty daunting.\n\nA CBCT scan has revealed a cracked root in my UL6 (first molar), with extensive external root resorption, which apparently means the tooth is unrestorable. The tooth isn’t causing me any pain but I’ve been told that it needs to be extracted.\n\nThe obvious treatment option is to have an implant (a bone graft would be needed at the extraction site for this due to the bone loss).\n\nBut coincidentally, shortly before discovering the UL6 issue I had an orthodontist consultation with a view to correcting moderate crowding and an upper midline shift to the right-hand side.\n\nAfter hearing that I was considering orthodontic treatment, the specialist who diagnosed the UL6 problem (who actually offers implants) recommended closing the gap left by the UL6 extraction with braces, and felt this was a better solution than an implant.\n\nI’ve seen two orthodontists to get their opinion about closing the post-extraction UL6 gap, and have had two very different opinions/recommendations:\n\nOrthodontist 1: \n\nTold me the space could be closed by moving UL7 (the second molar) forward into roughly half the space that will be left by the UL6 extraction, with the other half space filled by correcting the midline shift, which means moving my front teeth, canine, premolars, etc, over to the left.\n\nI asked about moving my UL8 (wisdom tooth) forward as well – as otherwise there would be a new space created between UL7 and UL8 – and was told it might be possible but that it would be more difficult to move this tooth than it would UL7.\n\nI was told the treatment time would be approx. 2 to 2.5 years.\n\nOrthodontist 2: \n\nTold me the above (treatment recommendation outlined by orthodontist 1) was possible but that at the end of treatment my front teeth \"wouldn’t look right\" (I think maybe due to creating another midline shift) unless they also extracted a healthy tooth on the upper right, which obviously I want to avoid.\n\nInstead, their recommendation was to leave the gap left by the UL6 extraction and correct the crowding/midline shift by moving the teeth forward without further extractions and using only about 1mm of space left by the UL6 extraction. (Estimated treatment time for this would be 1 to 1.5 years).\n\nIn their view, after treatment, it would be fine for me to leave the gap caused by the UL6 extraction or, if I wanted, to have an implant in the space. But they said there were no issues with just leaving a gap.\n\nHowever, orthodontist 1 has advised against leaving a gap after the UL6 extraction because of \"unstable occlusion and bone loss to the area\" and because it is \"unnecessary when UL7 could provide good occlusion for the mandibular antagonists\".\n\nConfusion\n\nI'm really confused by the two differing opinions and not sure who to believe. Both orthodontists have orthodontic masters degrees and plenty of experience.\n\nHas anyone on here, as an adult, tried closing a gap left by a molar extraction via braces? If so, did it work? Were there any problems?\n\nWould also be great to hear the views/thoughts of any orthodontists or dentists if poss.\n\nMy teeth and gums (apart from the UL6 tooth) are generally in pretty good health/condition and my original enquiry about getting braces was for cosmetic reasons to improve the appearance of the front teeth.\n\nMany thanks MattKW: Either recommendation (if possible) is still going to leave a gap. You might find this irritating.\nYour front teeth are fully settled into their \"happy\" position. Any ortho changes are likely to upset this balance and require long-term use of a fixed or removable retainer. Do you want this nuisance? Did the orthos advise you of this?\nThe chewing surface anatomy of a 7 is different to that of a 6. This could upset your chewing comfort and cause you occlusal issues (pain on chewing, cusp cracks). If this happens, you could get around it by crowning the 7 to make it \"fit\"the opposing 6, but this raises other risks.\nI suggest you leave the gap and save for an implant. There is a possibility that if the gap is left too long, the 8 may push the 7 forward, but tip it over. If the 8 has no opposing tooth with which to chew, I would consider extracting the 8.\nPut up an OPG Xray if you have it available.

Thank you.\n\nThere seem to be potential risks/issues with every option. It would mean dipping into savings but I can afford an implant. The specialist who diagnosed the UL6 tooth issue (and offers implants, so would benefit financially from ‘selling’ me one) for some reason felt closing the gap orthodontically was a better option for me. They pointed out the need for constant meticulous cleaning around the implant and that there’s a raised risk of gum disease in the area.\n\nThanks for raising the point about the chewing surface anatomy of a 7 being different to that of a 6 and the problems that may pose (neither ortho mentioned this).\n\nHere is a recent OPG x-ray: https://photos.app.goo.gl/2EFikk5wexSMc9Ho6\n\nAny thoughts/suggestions you may have after seeing the OPG would be gratefully received.\n\nRetainer/Ortho treatment\n\nRe: the need for a fixed or removable retainer. Yes, both orthos advised this. I could opt for a removable retainer at night only, but they both said having a fixed retainer as well is the best way to minimise the chances of the teeth moving/returning to their old position post-treatment.\n\nFrom what I’ve read, and please correct me if I’m wrong, people generally get used to using a retainer, and over time it may be possible to reduce wearing to every other night. The continued use of a retainer (providing it isn’t uncomfortable) seems like an okay trade-off for straight front teeth.\n\nI’ve been told, due to signs of wear, that I probably grind my teeth in my sleep and that it would be a good idea to get a mouth guard (which I’m going to look into), so I guess a removable orthodontic retainer would do a similar job – with a similar nuisance factor – to a mouth guard, which it seems I need anyway.\n\nAlso, I have some uneven wear on the edges of my upper central incisors that I’m told is caused by my bite and, as things stand, will get worse over time. So aside from the cosmetic reasons, I believe ortho treatment should be able to halt this problem and the edges then restored with composite bonding. MattKW: Thanks for info and OPG.\n\n I haven't had many patients successfully wear removable retainers for the rest of their lives from my orthodontists for a long time, most eventually find it a nuisance. \nUneven wear on your incisors is difficult to comment upon without a photo and examination. However, you have all your teeth present, and some minimal wear is expected over a lifetime. I'm 64 and mine aren't the same as 16yo, but orthodontic treatment to somehow \"prevent\" further wear is wishful thinking. I have seen many strange bites over the years that work quite happily, and it's a brave dentist who wants to start defying Mother Nature.\nI have seen the results of orthodontists trying to move molars forward, and I have yet to see a case where they really put in the effort and managed to keep a molar perfectly upright; the roots on your 2nd molars are long. If the molars are not upright after treatment, you won't be able to clean as easily as you can now, and decay follows; I really don't like the risk. If the orthodontists can show you similar cases they have treated successfully, then maybe I'm wrong.\nOn the good side, you have good bone thickness around your molar. Even after extraction, I think you'd be a good candidate for an implant.\nI'd still go for simultaneous extraction of the 1st and 3rd molars, then implant later.\nSo, you have lots of conflicting suggestions, and this is a big decision. Maybe go see a specialist prosthodontist for another opinion. Take along my comments. Keep in touch. Cheers.

It sounds like you have a lot of experience of seeing how the dental decisions people make turn out for them in the long-term.\n\nRegarding the uneven wear on the incisors, here are some photos:\n\nFront 1:\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/y3mXEEhhQ1wx1c2M8\n\nFront 2:\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/aJrup1BDRo8CLFfa9\n\nLeft side:\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/q3BGrTNbqrMeGzKx8\n\nRight side:\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/o7RQT6WbYyJpc9Gc8\n\nI guess, as things stand, the incisors would most likely continue to function without causing me problems for a good many years, but I presume that as the uneven wear continues, the teeth will look increasingly unsightly (although obviously there are far worse things in life than worn/crooked teeth).\n\nIt sounds like I might need to reconsider moving the UL7 into the UL6 space, and perhaps go the implant route instead. I’d been told that I’ve lost a fair amount of bone around the UL6. Perhaps that only shows up on the CBCT scan. Here is a CBCT image of the area:\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/66pfKEmQrWLmVKFx9\n\nIf I opted for an implant in the space after extraction of UL6 and also went ahead with ortho to straighten//improve the appearance of the front teeth, would it be okay to have these two treatments more or less concurrently? Or is it best to have the implant first, then do the orthodontics later? Or do the orthodontics first and then the implant after the brace has come off perhaps two years or so down the line?\n\nWould you recommend extracting UL8 in any case or is that just if I plan to leave an unfilled UL6 gap for a long period of time?\n\nSorry for all the questions. I greatly appreciate all the thoughts and insight you’ve given me already, and totally understand if you don’t have time to answer them all. MattKW: Thanks for all the pics. Hmm... interesting!\n\nIt'll be interesting to see what difference the ortho treatment makes to your front teeth. I'm no ortho, but that looks challenging. Looks like a Class II div 2, usually best addressed in the teenage years. Have they given to a print-out of what they think it'll look like at the end?\nI would have the ortho done first. Once you put in an implant, you can't change the position. This is more of an issue for anterior implants, but yeah, I'd avoid the implant for now. The orthodontist can keep the space open.\nLeave the 18 in place during ortho treatment. It might be useful as anchorage for the ortho treatment.\nOnce the ortho treatment is completed, and the implant has been placed, get rid of the 18. It probably doesn't contact much on the lower (maybe a bit of the lower 7 because of 1. above?), but they are difficult to keep clean for the rest of your life (90+?) and there is an unnecessary risk of developing either decay in the 8 itself, or decay in the back of the adjacent 7.

That’s really useful.\n\nIs it advisable to get a bone graft at the UL6 extraction site at the time of extraction if I have ortho treatment first and delay the implant by, say, two years or so?\n\nJust wondering, as I’ve read/been told different things about this. Some that it’s only worth getting a bone graft a short time before an implant is placed, others that it’s best to get a bone graft at the time of extraction to help preserve bone and gum, even if deferring an implant for a longish time.\n\nNo, they haven’t given me a printout or shown me what the teeth are likely to look like after treatment. Both orthodontists seemed confident the front teeth could be straightened, and the ortho who advised against trying to close the gap said the front teeth issue is ‘pretty easy to sort out’ with 12 to 18 months in braces.\n\nClass II div 2, yes, you’re absolutely right. Here is the finding of the ortho who took the OPG (not that I fully understand all of the wording):\n\n“He presents with a class II, division II incisor relationship on a skeletal II base with a reduced maxillary mandibular plane angle. The overjet is positive at 1mm and the overbite is increased and complete. There is moderate crowding in the upper arch and mild crowding in the lower arch. The upper centre line has displaced to the right and the lower centre line has displaced to the left. The molar relationship on the left is a full unit class II and on the right the molar relationship is class I. The x-rays show that the upper and lower incisors are retroclined and he has a horizontal impacted lower left wisdom tooth.” MattKW: Oh, didn't you get my consultation fee by email?

Usually the orthodontist will look at maxillary expansion at an early stage in order to avoid premolar extractions. However, if you get ortho treatment as an adult, maxillary expansion doesn't work, and premolar extractions may be an option to consider."

Much thanks Dr M: Good day\nIt does seem like you are leaning towards what we refer to as a class III jaw relationship, with either an overdeveloped lower jaw or underdeveloped upper jaw. Orthodontics with jaw surgery can definitely improve your profile. Additionally or alternatively, you can then maybe consider crown lengthening, where the gums around your top teeth are \" cut away\" surgically or with a laser and then shaped in order to reduce the amount of gum that shows when you smile.\nBoth these options should be carefully planned and will most likely form part of a comprehensive treatment plan"

Dr M: Good day\nOrthodontic retainers prevent relapse of your teeth after the treatment is finished. Relapse means your teeth shifting to the original position it was prior to treatment. \nSometimes the retainers don't reach all your teeth, because some of the molars might still be erupting or moving into their final position.\nRetainers don't last forever. At a later stage, you can make a new retainer that covers all your teeth."

Now he is saying that it’s going to take too much time to fix my midline and he wants to fix it with bonding. If he does bonding and not fixes my midline with braces, like I paid for , my two front teeth will still be off center. I have teeth that are still squished together on both sides. My bite is off.  My mouth is leaning more towards the left hand side. My mouth looks like it makes a half frown  on the left-hand side when I clench down.  One of my teeth on the right hand side has turned which is impossible to chew on my right hand side. We used that tooth to pull my midline . But now with the braces coming off in September I’ll be left with it turned which he said he could fix with a crown . With all this going on, he said we should be done by the end of September. He just now started asking me to wear bands at night to fix my bite. I don’t see how my bite could be fixed in four weeks.

Im from the US but also abroad most of the year so i could actually get it done.  But the thing is im not sure how long i would stay abroad which kept me from doing it.  But i been abroad for years in that country so i could have easily done it.. but didn't.\n\n\nI heard it was like two years max doing it but to me at the time, it seemed so long so i didn't bother.  I heard most treatments are one to two years with average being l.5 years right?  But people who do it probably could do l year if their teeth aren't bad?  My teeth is bad.  But even when you do invisilign even if it take two years... well after few months, you see smart improvement right?\n\n\nNow I am a bit considering doing this when abroad again.  But my main issue is if i do it abroad... for say 6 months and then come back to the US permanently or something like that... how would it work finishing the invisilign back in the US?  Or imagine half the work was done abroad... and i need to finish half the work back in the US.  Surely it won't cost the full amount in the US as abroad right? george3: Now because I didn't do this... i also wanted to know... is it possible to get temporary teeth?  By that i mean wearing it for a few occasions or rare events.  Obviously never wearing it always as it would be like fake.. as if you wear it like that... then people find out you have real bad teeth that is not good.  So i only would want to wear it on rare occasions.  \n\n\nI heard something like this could be done and it requires a visit to who?  Is it a dentist or like those surgeons?  Like i want to have good perfect teeth but temporary to wear... but i only wear it few times.  How much would that cost and would you recommend that?\n\n\nAnyone here done this and have experience?  How long would it take for them to construct the fake temporary teeth for you?\n\n\nI did post a bit of this on the general forum but my question would be on invisilign.\n\n\nThanks. george3: Anyone?"

With braces, you teeth are not intended to move too rapidly or bone and or root damage may occur.  With 2 days of removable braces, there should not be much movement if any at all.

The thing is that this created a disaster growing up and, some adult teeth have grown and moved in wrong positions which weren't theirs. They took the spot of two premolars that were supposed to come out and consequently didn't have space to do so, for this reason now I've got a premoral under my tongue right next to other teeth which have a natural positions on the left, and on the right I've got one that is a little shifted from its natural spot (it doesn't look as bad as the other on the left which basically on the floor of the mouth). Do you think it needs urgent treatment? Thanks for time! Dr M: Good day\n\nI would not classify this as urgent treatment. Sometimes the premolars can cause chronic ulcerations to the tongue and then you have to consider removal. If it also makes cleaning difficult, and predisposes the other teeth to cavity formation, you can consider removing them.\nWhen you have time, you can seek the opinion of your local dentist, to evaluate if anything needs to be done."

    "title": "Was IPR necessary?",
    "dialogue": "Draney3: Hi all,\n\nI have a question regarding some IPR I had done. Back in January 2020, I went to an orthodontist for an Invisalign consultation regarding a 4 mm overjet of my two front teeth and minor spacing between them and the teeth next to them, among other issues I was not as concerned with. The orthodontist looked at my teeth for a few minutes, did some measurements, then said I'd need aligners on both arches. He then looked again and said he thought he could get it done with just an aligner on the top arch, coming to this conclusion without any scan of the teeth. This past October, I went to another orthodontist who said I'd probably need IPR on some bottom teeth so I could fix the overjet. He was surprised the other orthodontist thought he could do this with only a single arch treatment. After scanning my teeth, I did indeed need IPR, so I went with that. I understand a double arch treatment is generally recommended so bite issues won’t occur, but I wish I got a third opinion, so I'm asking here after the fact. \n\nHere is my ClearCorrect plan from my teeth scan so you can how they looked before: https://dr.clearcorrect.com/treatme...9FEF222E/8DD8E0BF-F006-4E85-B9A4-36DE086768A7. The second orthodontist said the plan would \"align both arches and relieve any crowding while correcting the rotations and angulation of the teeth. The general shapes of both arches are improved and your lower mid-line will be slightly shifted back towards the center. We will need to perform IPR (tooth shaving) in the lower arch to improve the overjet and overbite.\" \n\nI completely understand if no one can have an informed opinion considering you only have the scan to go off of. \n\nThanks! MattKW: I couldn't say if IPR is necessary. It is very rare (impossible?) for any orthodontist to guarantee that your teeth won't want to move after the treatment is finished. IPR does not guarantee this either. All ortho patients have to be prepared to wear retainers for the rest of their lives if they want to keep their teeth perfectly aligned.\nPersonally, I don't like IPR because it's taking away good enamel, and it makes a broader contact point between the teeth that is only harder to keep clean. My son's orthodontist wanted to IPR his lower incisors so that he could close the gaps in the upper incisors completely; I said \"No\", and just closed the upper gaps with composite bonding."

    "title": "Potential 'remoulding' of teeth",
    "dialogue": "howso: Hello there\n\nI was intending to investigate my daughters orthodontic dental treatment earlier on in the year but got cold feet. But now she has had the brace removed and correction work done I am really curious as to whether she has been treated well.\n\nShe had the brace on for 5 years in order to reposition an impacted canine. This procedure was unsuccessful and has left her with the tooth ankylosed. Our local hospital has done an excellent job of repairing this problem and built on what has been exposed and fingers crossed it lasts a long time. However her two front incisors have been left sloping at the edge and at approx. 30 degrees angles opposite each other. As if she has been chewing on a pen for a hell of a long time. There was signs of wear to the edge of those teeth at the beginning of treatment but now those signs are so much worse that expensive repair has been necessary. I have looked into this and had looked at x-rays and it appears to me (someone who know nothing about dental treatment) that the two teeth have been remoulded over time. Yet after complaining to the practice the orthodontist has written to us stating that the crown and roots of the teeth can not move independently and no remoulding has taken place. I have sought second opinions but these are only concerned with best ways to move forward and don't want to comment on how they got into this state. It is very frustrating and I would welcome any advice. Dr M: Good day\n\nDo you perhaps have a photo the affected teeth? howso: Hi there and thanks for your interest.\n\nI have attached three images. The first is the progress of the teeth over 5 years brace treatment. And then one collection of x-rays taken over the years. The last one is a close up of the first x ray image. Please let me know if you want them any bigger.\n\nMuch appreciated. Dr M: I have never heard of remolding of teeth after orthodontic treatment as you are describing it. On the clinical photos it almost seems as if the teeth were rotated and angled in such a way in order to close the diastema. \nSo it seems that your problem is maybe an angulation problem? howso: I  understand what you are saying about it being an angulation problem in order to close the diastema. That is the first conclusion made by most. However if you look at the X-ray from October 2017 and tilt the front teeth back into central position (so as to appear in the same position as October 2019) the angulation of the edge of the teeth remains the same as in October 2017. Surely the angulation would drop if remoulding wasn't a thing and tilting was all that had been done and was needed? Believe me I have tried this with Photoshop and if it was a simple case of angulation the edge would be in a different position to it is now. Basically with enough constant strain over 5 years can the crown and the roots act as if moving independently, particularly as they are still growing?\n\nSurely if the teeth are still growing and being pulled by both the brace and the root pocket (whatever that is called) then over 5 years they could actually become twisted or 'remoulded'? Please find attached illustrations which may explain what I am trying to get across. \n\nAgain thanks for any help or advice."

Dr M: Good day\n\nBy looking at your lateral x-ray, it does look like you are in a Class II skeletal relationship, which means either your lower jaw is under-developed or your upper jaw is over-developed.\nTo determine exactly which is which, more calculations will be needed.\nSevere overbites, might not be problematic at this stage, but as you grow older, the malocclusion might cause problems due to excessive wear on the back of your upper teeth and then lead to more severe problems.\nFortunately you are never too old to have braces, although the long -term success is better when the treatment is started when at a younger age.\nTo determine if only braces is needed in order to achieve some sort of camouflage outcome, or if complex treatment with or without jaw surgery is needed, it is best to go for a consult with an experienced orthodontist. The specialist will do the necessary calculations, and then draw up one or two treatment plans, that will best suit your specific case.\nAsk your dentist for a referral."

I did not feel any abnormal discomfort a few weeks after that last appointment. Maybe 3 weeks after, the teeth that have gotten an ipr done started feeling sore and sensitive. This has lasted over a month and is still currently happening. My teeth are shifting in the front and are very sore and sensitive and its not going away. This has never happened to me in my entire experience with braces and every ipr done and Im getting worried. Usually the discomfort after a procedure has been done lasts a week maximum but after the first week of discomfort, my teeth felt normal. It wasn’t until 2-3 weeks in that I felt this weird discomfort. The dentist says they don’t notice any wearing of the enamel. Since then I have tried sensitive tooth paste, flossed daily, and used a fluoride mouthwash. My teeth shifted weird and I would like to do some slight additional ipr in certain areas but Im worried this will add onto the issue. I also noticed the front two teeth that hurt the most have started browning above the gum line which is strange but idk if this is related, I just noticed this today. Can anybody please tell me what you believe the issue is and what I can do about it because this is unbearable or if this has happened to you as well. I am 18 years old and have never had any dental issues related to this. Dr M: Good day\n\nDo you have pictures of the teeth? It is possible that with excessive IPR, the dentine could have been exposed, leading to the sensitivity you are experiencing now. If this procedure has been done many times, the dentinal tubules could have been exposed in certain areas. Unfortunately the only solution for this would be IDS, with possible restorations after the ortho has been completed and there is space available for these restorations.\nIs your ortho treatment being done by an experienced orthodontist? plzhelp: I was initially afraid that I had done an excess in ipr as well but I visited both my orthodontist and dentists and I was reassured that my teeth still have thick enamel based on x rays as well. I believe my orthodontist is experience and I was told that I could do additional ipr for some crooked spots if my teeth stopped becoming sensitive. You briefly mentioned an IDS and would you care to elaborate further on this? I have attached a photo of my teeth currently and would like to get some opinions. Do you believe this is a normal process of the teeth moving or is there something more to this that I should get checked out? Dr M: Sorry, the photos are a bit blurry, so it is difficult to see. \nFirst things first, I assume that you understand why IPR was done in the first place. This is usually done when there is a minor space discrepancy. A few mm of enamel is then taken off to provide space for the teeth to move into their optimal position and allignment within the arch. There are limiting factors to this procedure such as the size of the discrepancy as well as the amount and quality of enamel present. \nIt could be that the sensitivity you are experiencing is only transient and will disappear with time. I have found that sometimes when I advise my patients to take a toothpaste designed for sensitivity, and then rub the toothpaste with your finger all over the affected teeth, it helps to relieve the symptoms. The key is that you have to leave it on the tooth for at least 5min before rinsing with water.\nIf the teeth sensitivity doesn't disappear, it might be that you exposed dentinal tubules in certain areas and then this has to be sealed in order to prevent movement of fluid, located in the dentinal tubules, that lead to the sensitivity. \nIDS or immediate dentine sealing is a procedure done to seal dentine by applying a dentine sealing agent to usually freshly exposed dentine under indirect restorations. Although your IPR was done a few weeks ago, I have found some dentists achieving success by applying this procedure, before placing a resin restoration, and thereby eliminating the sensitivity. It helps to seal the dentinal tubules.\nI would give it some time, to see if the the pain disappears, but if not, I would bring this up the next time you visit your orthodontist. It might be that you are reaching the limit of what is possible with IPR and that alternative methods should be considered for creating more space to move your teeth. plzhelp: I have attached the photos again hopefully they are visible. I really am hoping this discomfort will go away. I also am not sure if what I am experiencing is soreness of shifting teeth or not. My teeth feel this discomfort mostly when I am able to shift my front teeth with my tongue. Additonally, may I ask if it is possible to see if you have exposed dentines through dental xrays? My dentist did not see any issues with my teeth in regards to enamel when an xray was perfomed. Dr M: Good day\n\nUnfortunately it is difficult to see exposed dentin on a x-ray. It is important to note that as your teeth move, you will have some periods of discomfort. I also had braces and I had times were some of my teeth were very painful and even slightly mobile. This was only for a short while and then it stabilized again. So my advice would beto wait and see."

If implants are the last option and they will work for me I feel I'll be less worried about the risks of permanent toothless caused by the braces.  Just want normal straight teeth and not have to worry about future gaps ! Would love to hear your opinions! Dr M: Good day\n\nIt is difficult to give an exact opinion without any x-rays or a consultation, but usually impacted canines can be moved into the position with braces with or without a chain. If the tooth can't be moved, then usually you can either camouflage your front teeth, by shaping the remaining teeth so that everything appears normal. This is done by various prosthodontic methods. Or an orthodontist can re-space the other teeth, to create space for possible implants.\nIn severe cases, and in combination with a severe cross-bite, it might be necessary that you will require some sort of surgery. Your orthodontist will then collaborate with another type of specialist-usually an maxillo-facial surgeon.\nMy opinion would be to get a second opinion from another orthodontist."

Dr M: Good day\n\nMost oral surgeons use a form of resorbable sutures. They usually only last for about 7-10 days, and then start to dissolve with the water in your mouth. So don't stress too much about this.\nThe photo isn't the best quality, but I don't believe you have a dry socket. A dry socket usually appears after 3-4 days, and is extremely painful.\nIf you are not in pain, then it is my conclusion that everything is healing as it should.\n\nHope this helps."

I'm 36 and 11 weeks ago (just before shutdown in the UK) I had stainless braces fitted.\n\nI had finished teeth whitening a month prior to fitment, and the orthodontist commented on the fact they looked 'nice and white'.\n\nHowever, despite taking extremely good care of my teeth with the braces fitted, they're now discoloured to the point I'm extremely self-conscious about it. The discoloration is uniform across all my teeth to the point I'm questioning if I have an enamel issue and whether or not braces are even a good idea :/\n\nAdd in the fact it's been 11 weeks with no adjustment (dentists are allowed to reopen today in the UK) and no current appointment made to do so has left me extremely frustrated. I'm regretting not going the smile direct club route; I'd be half way through treatment now :/ \n\nI would really like to just have the braces taken off, and go the smile direct club route(maybe there is a second wave of Corona and further shutdowns) but if I do that, my teeth are liable to move before I get my retainers sent.\n\nCan anyone offer any advice. I'm facing 45 weeks + of this. Absent the discoloration, it wouldn'te an issue, but as it is, I'm finding it tough.\n\nThanks in advance! honestdoc: Why can't you get any appointments when the office is reopened?  Are you able to use the same whitening system as before?  Can you provide images? Muskopia: The system I used before was retainer based. Emergency appointments are first, then cases such as mine. Capacity has been severely impacted as a result of Covid safety measures.\n\nI'm now brushing 3x per day. Mouthwashing 4x per day and using a charcoal powder mouth rinse( 2 mins long) 2x per day. Seems to be helping somewhat.\n\nI will post pics a little later. honestdoc: Are you using Chlorhexidine rinse?  It can discolor your teeth.  Maybe you can use a general tray for whitening.

Does any Over the Counter whitening products help?  Could you reuse your previous whitening system? Muskopia: I'm very careful with my diet. \n\nI take tumeric powder 3x per day. Buts that's in gelatin capsule form. That's the only thing in my diet I can think of that may stain. I Only drink water and am very careful with what I choose to eat (plenty of powdered oats and protein powder in shakes for me!).\n\nI'm guessing I cant have some whitening retainers made which fit over my braces? \n\nThanks for the help so far"

My incisors are good and so are my canines, but the canines need moved in closer to the incisors. Once I've done this then I wanted to get implants either side on my canines left and right side. Does this make sense?\n\nYou will also notice one of my first pre molars has moved a considerable distance and you can see from the xray the angle of the tooth is significant.\n\nI have had a smiledirect simulation of how my teeth would move with clear aligners but to be honest I'm not sure and it looks like the aligners would just move all my incisors and canines backwards into my mouth, thus closing the gaps, but I'm not sure if I could get an implant to fit between the canine and first pre molar.\n\nDoes anyone have any better suggestions? \n\nI really stuck on this but am keen to do something as it's getting me down.\n\nHappy to provide further details.\n\nMany thanks in advance. MattKW: You won't simply close gaps with aligners. Some considerations:\n1. Get opinion from specialist orthodontist to close front gaps.\n2. In conjunction with orthodontist, see a prosthodontist if you can afford it. Maybe the orthodontist can suggest someone with a good reputation. Get the ortho to collaborate with the prosdo. Together they will give you a much better overall plan if contemplating implants.\n3. Lower right premolar looks like doubtful root canal treatment (RCT). Get opinion to see if worth saving. Might be better to extract now and place 2 implants in this area. Get other RCTs checked too because an OPG is poor resolution and you want to make sure before starting this journey. Irishman: Hi,\n\nThank you so much for your prompt and detailed reply, very informative indeed and all points duly noted.\n\nI have subsequently spoken to a well respected implant specialist and they are of the opinion that it may be more prudent to remove the premolar to allow room for a cantilevered implant. The same cantilevered type implant would also be fitted on the other side meaning one implant beside each canine teeth on the lower jaw, giving 4 teeth.\n\nI haven't done much research on cantilevered implants but he seemed to think this would be a satisfactory solution to fill the gaps based on the location.\n\nThis would still leave a gap on my left side lower jaw beside a molar but I am fine with this.\n\nThanks again for your time and insight.\n\nAll the best and stay safe!"

MattKW: Simple answer, no. Your face stopped changing in late teens, and an extraction won't make any difference.\nIf you are receiving psychological counselling for your depression, then discuss these feelings with your psychiatrist or psychologist. honestdoc: Do you have any eating disorders and or compromised medical conditions?  Do you have any unexplained weight loss?  If so, have them corrected and or managed.

Some background...\n\nI have recently had two wisdom teeth removed, a few root canals and crowns on the right and left side along with some fillings. Essentially a lot of work that needed to be done is getting done. I still have to get one more crown completed on a tooth on the right side of my mouth that has had a root canal done so far. I am though noticing after the work that has been done thus far that my overall bite doesn't feel the same as before. I am thinking it may have something to do with one of the crowns. I don't have a high bite, it actually feels like my teeth sink down more now when I force myself to bite. The main issue is I feel I need to reach further to make a bite and my mouth doesn't naturally want to close like before. So more of a bite when I am trying to make it happen, but it is making my front and bottom two tooth (8/9 & 24/25) touch each other more and creating a pushing/tension feeling that wasn't there before.  It's very slight but something I feel didn't exist before and want to determine what the issue is.  Some some more background, the dentists were not able to make a mold of the existing tooth prior to doing a root canal as the tooth had shattered prior, so the crown fits but I am guessing the top of the tooth wasn't made to match and they did some grinding until the bite felt right at the time.\n\nMy main questions are:\n1) Is this bite issue a normal sensation post receiving a number of procedures and it may need time to \"settle\" back to where things were?\n2) Or is this something else and orthodontics can fix it or determine the issue on? If so, what is the process, a full mouth/jaw x-ray?\n3) If I wanted to do braces/invisalign, should I get the remaining left wisdom teeth removed and have the crown put on the final tooth and then do the orthodontics to get this \"back in order\"?\n\nThank you!"

From the looks of the picture that you posted, I believe you're a perfect candidate for Invisalign or other clear aligner treatment. Keep in mind, I'm assuming that you don't have any issues with your back teeth and bite, as clear aligners don't work well for moving posterior teeth. Assuming this is the case, you're a perfect candidate for clear aligner therapy. Closing gaps is really where clear aligners are most effective. With regards to IPR, that's typically reserved for cases where your teeth are too large for your jaw. Judging from your picture, this does not appear to be the case. Therefore I would say IPR is unnecessary in your case. As a final reminder, be sure to continue wearing your retainers at nights following the completion of your clear aligner therapy, especially if you're under 40. Otherwise, you risk having your diastema return within a few years! I estimate your treatment time to be less than 6 months if the gap is really only 1-2 millimeters (each aligner moves your teeth about 0.2-0.3 mm every 2 weeks so you can estimate your treatment time based on that). Hope this helps and good luck with your teeth straightening journey!"

    "title": "Opening up the bite",
    "dialogue": "snaggletooth: My lower front teeth dig into the backs of my upper front teeth and are wearing them away. Two dentists told me I needed crowns to open up my bite, then two orthodontists told me braces would do the job. I won't get crowns because they do too much damage and ultimately fail, but I don't understand how braces will correct the situation. Please explain. Busybee: Any work you have done to try to fix this problem could create far worse problems.   Your best bet is a nightguard and consciously avoiding grinding.    It's not simple and I think you can see that given the radical suggestions for treatment which you have had to date, that it could cost a lot with no guarantee that any of their ideas will work.  The suggestions will result in permanent changes which could affect your ability to talk, smile, eat and your appearance.  Think carefully about whether the current problem is so bad that you want to take such a risk. snaggletooth: Thanks. I appreciate the warning. I'll ask the orthodontist to consider what I think might work, and hope that he can explain, to my satisfaction, why it will or won't work. If he can't explain, I'll keep looking for a dentist who can.\n\nI use a nightguard and I don't grind when I'm awake, but the backs of my upper teeth are damaged and need to be repaired. It seems to me if the bottom teeth can be moved back, so as not to dig into the backs of the upper teeth, that should work. What say you? evensmiles: Your front teeth are not supposed to touch like that. There's supposed to be a gap between your front teeth so that they are not touching one another constantly. If you have a poor bite relationship, or if your teeth have worn down over the years, your front teeth start to touch one another. This is referred to as edge-to-edge bite and is very harmful to your front teeth. Braces is your best option here. Your orthodontist can push your teeth apart to give you this safety space to protect your front teeth from further damage. Crowns may also work for some minor cases. But since crowns can't move your teeth much, your problem may not be permanently solved. Plus for crowns to work you need to place crowns on a whole bunch of your teeth (at least 6) which ends up costing more than braces anyways. Hope this helps guide you in the right direction! Nandhini K M: It is possible to open your bite and correct the occlusion with orthodontic treatment. However, to do so, your age and gum strength should support. If your dentist recommends you for braces, I believe, your gums and other supporting structure are pretty strong to accept the procedure. With the help of braces, it is possible to realign tooth position to the desired need and in general, it would take upto one year of treatment duration. Your condition is called \" deep bite \" which tend to damage the lower front teeth on due course of time if left unheard. It's better to opt for orthodontic management rather than the crown because of two reasons. 1) unnecessary grinding of tooth structure which is not a conservative procedure. 2) Even after placing the crown, there are more chances for the prosthesis to abrade or become wear-off because of minimal space available in your condition. For these reasons, it is better to go for braces, providing that your gums are supportive. I hope this helps to decide better. snaggletooth: I'm seventy-two, and I can't afford braces, anyway. Nandhini K M: snaggletooth said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI'm seventy-two, and I can't afford braces, anyway.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nHo okay! then the crown would be a convincing option for you considering your age snaggletooth: Can't afford crowns and I don't like them, anyway. They destroy the teeth they \"crown\", and they fail eventually. honestdoc: I agree with Busybee in considering a night guard.  The Over-the-Counter night guard is less costly but it is one size fits all.  The custom bite guard is very costly but will fit the best.  If you opt for the custom guard, I recommend a hard/soft bite guard which is hard on the outside and softer on the inside contacting your teeth. snaggletooth: I've been using a nightguard for the last two years."

    "dialogue": "troycima18: Hi, I'm 17 and got my second molar removed months ago. I wonder if it's okay to replace it with my first molar, while also replacing my first molar with my wisdom tooth. Can the braces do that? Or do I really need to replace my second molar with a new one? I also want to ask if I need to remove all of my wisdom before getting braces. Thank you for answering! MattKW: At your age, the wisdom teeth are past the point where they might naturally move into position of 2nd molars. It might be possible to move them into position of 2nd molars with ortho, but you'll have to talk to the orthodontist. Unfortunately, the wisdoms are often odd shapes with strange roots and may not be of benefit. evensmiles: Unfortunately replacing a 2nd molar with a wisdom tooth is not an option at your age. Braces can only move teeth a tiny bit and they aren't meant to move a whole molar tooth over. You have two basic options here: Leave it alone or place a dental implant. Leaving it alone is a bit risky, as the tooth above your missing 2nd molar will slowly move down and create issues. Dental implant is really your best choice here.\nRegarding your second question, you don't have to remove your wisdom teeth to start braces treatment. Of course, it's better to do so, but not mandatory in most instances (infection abscessed wisdom teeth are the exception and they must be removed right away). Just be sure to wear your retainers religiously if you choose to keep your wisdom teeth for the time being. Hope this helps and good luck!"

You should take your daughter to an orthodontist for the right treatment plan. \nInvisalign treatment works well with some cases but can be made sure only after preliminary results are supportive\nShe needs to get a cephalogram and an OPG  to plan treatment.Also visiting a dentist will be a much better option as they can check the patient in person and see the findings which are not visible on photos."

That will leave me with 24 teeth, I just wondered is it generally safe to have that amount of teeth for a 37 year old? Could I possibly experience future problems? I asked my dentist this question but he just gave a broad answer saying there are always jaw risks when undergoing orthodontics.\n\nThe size of my arches in the after pics of my clin check look a lot smaller which concerns me. Does anyone think its absolutely necessary to have teeth extractions to reduce the protrusion or can I go without?\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHope you can help answer my question Busybee: You will look very different but isn't that what you want?  You do know that you normally have to wear a retainer the rest of your life and that there is the risk of root resorption? LuciaMaria: Thanks for responding. Yes I do want to reduce my protrusion but I'm just worried that I will potentially be opening up future health problems with having a smaller mouth. And what do you mean there is a risk of root reabsorption?\nYes I realise that I have to wear retainers for the rest of my life but isn't that the same with everyone undergoing orthodontistry ? Busybee: With orthodontic procedures there is a risk.that roots will be shorter after treatment.  It's a risk for anyone undergoing orthodontic treatment.    Your dentist mentioned jaw risks.  But you don't feel you can communicate with him about this?  It's really important that you feel comfortable with your dentist when you are undergoing such radical work.  Your dentist should be able to address all your concerns and fully explain what you should expect afterwards and the risks. LuciaMaria: The dentist just gave me broad answers. He didn't give me any explanations to any possible risks he just said there are potential risks to all orthodontic treatment. Do you think I should consult with someone else?\n\n\nI'm just in the process now of going through and checking the 3d imaging that invisalign/dentist prescribed for me, he is just waiting for me to give the final all clear so they can send it off to make the aligners. Busybee: There is no harm in seeking a second opinion.  This is radical treatment and you should feel totally comfortable with your dentist and fully understand the risks and expected outcome.   You may be unhappy with the way you look now, but some people are unhappy with the way they look after treatment. LuciaMaria: I did have a consultation for the same treatment with a specialist orthodontist, he also teaches orthodontistry at university, published books on it etc so he seems like a very qualified person to ask advice.\nHe just explain the risks to my other teeth (because I've got 5 restoration teeth  crowns/root canal filling) and he said it is possible to extract the 4 teeth but he doesn't think that it will make much difference to my profile. I can't remember exactly if he said there would be risks to my jaw etc, Ive emailed his admin team. MattKW: If the specialist orthodontist said he doesn't think it will make much difference to your profile, then you have to seriously take that on board. From a GP point of view, I also think it will not help your profile; I think you look just fine. In any case, to retract your chin profile, you'd really only remove 2 upper teeth to pull your upper front teeth back and give the illusion of a straighter profile.\nComputer simulations from Invisalign for cases like yours (jaw discrepancy) are a concern. I certainly wouldn't use Invisalign after extracting premolars; you really have to use braces, but your dentist, Dr A, probably isn't qualified for braces so he's not informing you of that option, ... or has he? Invisalign cannot move molars forward.\nIt is very rare nowadays (in Aust.) to have 4 premolars removed. It used to be a common procedure, but it tends to make people's faces look smaller and sunken. If unsure, then spend a little bit of money and get another specialist orthodontist opinion. It could save you a lot of tears. Busybee: So why did you decide to go to the dentist you are with now rather than the specialist? LuciaMaria: Yes as I have explained in the first comment that I would like my side profile to look smaller and more sunken because right now my mouth is protruding and sticking out so yes that is the effect I want. I have also had genioplasty which is why the lower mouth doesn't  look as bad, but my original chin was receding. I decided to go with the dentist because he offered me a better deal for invisalign along with extractions. I would have gone to the specialist but their price is 10 xs more and what would be the point if the specialist  doesn't do extractions but just offers me the same product which is invisalign. I wanted metal braces but because I have 2 front crowns the brackets could potentially come off therefore I can't get metal braces. Actually there are different invisalign models that you can get, I've seen them online such as the g6 invisalign which is designed to use with teeth extractions. \nHere is the link:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is me before genioplasty and rhinoplasty \n\n\n\n\n\n This is after genioplasty and rhinoplasty Busybee: The temptation with trying to achieve a certain look is that you keep having work done and you are still not satisfied.  It can be an endless cycle and in the meantime you make irreversible changes. MattKW: Well, it's your money and your face. If you don't seek a specialist opinion, then it's on your head (literally). As you say, you've had a genioplasty, but now you want to pull your upper and lower front teeth backwards - how will that make the effect of the genioplasty better? I think it'll be a poor result. Bye... LuciaMaria: Yes I think people do become obsessed with trying to achieve a certain look especially within the plastic surgery industry but I had quite a few problems with my facial features beforehand that's why I opted for plastic surgery and teeth extractions/orthodontics, so it wasn't about vanity more trying to look what society deems as normal/average. Busybee: With your teeth you should try to achieve the change with as little work as possible.    The proposed work could achieve the opposite of what you are seeking.     It may make your face look wider but your cheeks and neck to sag rather than look more delicate.  I'm sure there are more conservative routes to getting where you want to be.  Don't rush into this.

Can you tell me more?\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to respond and I apologize for the lack of info. My 2 year old fell into a desk and knocked out her front right incisor. She now has a lisp and covers her mouth ALL the time. She filmed her first movie at four months and is a child model/actress. We would really like to get her the pedi partial as we think she would benefit from it. She has her first primary molars, but not her second. (She just turned 2) I was wondering if the pedo-partial can connect to the first molar or if we would have to wait till her second primary molars come in before she can get the pedo-partial ? MattKW: I wouldn't do a pedo partial, and I think you'd find it hard to find anyone who would either. The partial would make her lisp even more, and not only interfere with speech development, but may also restrict her jaw growth. At best, you might do an Essix retainer as a simple and easily replaceable option. I'd suggest you see a paedodontist. Jenniferphillips: That’s strange. There are quite a few that do them and in a child of her age. The dentist here who extracted her tooth said he’d be happy to do one once she cooperates a little more in his chair. She has an appointment with a pediatric dentist in Beverly Hills. Their office says they do them on children between two and six all the time. I just wasn’t sure if they connect the device to the first or second molar. Why would you think this partial wouldn’t be a good idea? I’ve read that it will help the lisp and boost her self esteem, plus help maintain the space for the permanent tooth to come in as well at help her eating. Jenniferphillips: Jenniferphillips said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAlso, she is too young for a retainer. She is only two. She can choke on it, lose it etc. it’s not a very good option for a two year old. With the groper, it will permanently attach to her molars and be removed when the permanently tooth come in. I read this has no affect in the jaw, hence it’s attached to the anterior part of the teeth. I just wanted to know if this device can be attached to the first molar?\n\t\t\nClick to expand..."

We have gotten two widely divergent opinions on treatment.\n\n[1] One doc says the lower jaw growth is basically done, so we will put a pin anchor in upper, extract upper molars to make room, and then pull upper incisors back.  This is a partial solution, not likely to fully correct, and eventually adult jaw surgery will be necessary.  Takes about two and a half years.  This doc uses traditional elastic binder brackets for braces.  [Extract upper juvenile secondary molars - note: he was born without adult teeth for that one].\n\n[2] Other doc says the we will harness the remaining lower jaw growth and repair it now. He will place Herbst appliance and push lower jaw forward. No extractions.  Done in two years, appliance for first year only.  This doc uses Damon system brand slide braces.  [This doc says the upper teeth look good, incl juvenile secondary, and no reason to go in and extract and move them around].\n\nSo, opposite philosophies and opposite treatments.\nInsights welcome, please thanks.\n\nPatient has a significant skeletal malocclusion, and significantly deficient chin due to very short jaw.  Excessive overjet.  He basically can't close his lips due to misalignment.  Shows 7 mm of upper incisor at rest.

No sign of throbbing pain or pus or discolor. Just a very tender bony feeling bump. Any ideas? MattKW: No idea. If it looks normal colour it may simply be bony protrusion that can take months to remodel. AnxietyPup: That’s what my dentist had thought when I called in. I did not know a bony protrusion could be so tender though. Also, thank you for taking the time to reply. AnxietyPup:  honestdoc: If it is hurting so much that it is affecting the way you function in that area, you may consider having your dentist remove or smooth the bony protrusion.  We generally allow time for it to heal like Dr. MattKW mentioned.  We generally have to manipulate bone while extracting teeth so sometimes bone remodels a certain way."

My lower jaw didn't look as defined and whole face did not seem to be as 'full' as it used to be, but I didn't think much of this. Around March, I noticed that my front two teeth have shifted so far forward that the bottom of them were touching my lower lips, a feeling I had not felt since I was a kid with dental issues. I also thought about the facial change that I noticed from months back, and noticed the changes became much more prevalent. My upper lip stuck out noticeable in front of my lower one, and the lower one also started to curve. Along with this, I also noticed my nose ridge has a little bump, protruded outwards, and seemed to have moved to a slightly lower position.

Thankyou Lyle MacLeod: I had to get molar teeth taken out of both sides of my top teeth when getting my brace so I'd imagine this would be the same for you, however I'm not a dentist so I would make sure you talk to one to confirm this. My gums did take a while to heal so it was worth it but I understand that the recovery period for wisdom tooth removal is much more severe. So I would avoid it if you can.\n\nAlso, my brother got one of those removable braces to realign his teeth before he got train tracks (although he didn't need any teeth removed) so I would look into that as well. Maybe they can assist your overcrowding initially so much so that you can get train tracks without needing to remove your wisdom teeth. ferberdental: Everyone is different. In normal circumstances both upper and lower wisdom teeth are removed at the same time because they are a set. If your bottom ones are removed, the top ones may eventually come in and not have anything to bite against. Don’t worry about them moving your upper teeth as long as you are wearing your retainer. MattKW: The wisdom teeth will not upset any orthodontic treatment, so are not removed for that reason (either before or after ortho). They are often removed due to the difficulty in cleaning them, and this can lead to gum infections or decay."

The best ones out there are zirconium ones they last forever with good care i suppose. I know its not cheap, i travelled abroad to have my teeth done. I went to Turkey, they were great, had my new smile in 5 days and it looks so natural. was cheaper than braces too and got a great tan!! haha but you could try them for a quote, they can email it to you. just send an enquiry online. I hope this helps!! BilboSwaggins: Make sure you are going to an orthodontist. They actually specialize in straightening teeth. General Dentists have the ability to \"specialize\" in Invisalign, but it doesn't mean they are orthodontists. Just my two cents. Go visit a few and get some advice from several.\n\nGood luck! Don't lose hope just yet. DentistD: hey I think you need a good cosmetic dentist who can able to handle your critical teeth..consult with 2-3 dentist and then choose best dentist to your teeth.. stevengoldy: I suggest you to prefer well experienced orthodontists for your critical dental care.\nthey can treat you with best solution like invisalign or else to improve your smile. dr atish malviya: yes with orthodontic correction ,you can get your teeth aligned and that is the best option,because i myself practice orthodontics rootcanalha: Very original teeth indeed, you should be proud of the layout unless it causes discomfort."

MattKW: You have to start with an Xray to see where the lateral incisor is hiding. Sometimes they don't grow at all. A canine would be expected any time from now on, so that's still within the right time. Get an Xray, and go to an orthodontist for an opinion. billw3r: I would like to know if It is upper or lower lateral. Most likely it would be a lower lateral.\nThis happens quiet frequently. If your child's deciduous teeth were perfect, then your permanent teeth are larger than the deciduous teeth so you got a crowded problem to start with.\nFrequently you would need some additional room on the 4 lower anteriors to get them to come in straight.\nYou can have a lower lateral come up and eat a part of the root of the decidous cuspid when it gets to an enamel part of the deciduous tooth, it cannot absorb the enamel portion of the baby tooth, so it gets stuck.\nYou can extract the deciduous cuspids, which will give you more room than you need.\nIf you can take away from both deciduous cuspid a portion of the tooth, it is better to do a pulpotomy and take only portion of the cuspid you need.\nI show this in detail in this video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to provide this room on both cuspids to keep the midline on. If you give the teeth too much room, the permanent cuspids will move forward into that room, and you will loose arch length, so it is normally not good to extract the cuspids, but this is more complicated than most people like to deal with.\n\n[link removed by admin] MattKW: Uh, no, have to disagree. Most congenitally missing laterals or unerupted laterals are uppers. Similarly, most impacted canines are upper canines. I don't know if I have ever seen an unerupted lower lateral; they always come up, either twisted, or lingually or laterally displaced (and resorb the adjacent canine). It's more likely to assume that the lady is talking about an upper tooth. billw3r: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUh, no, have to disagree.

I have lectured to many paediatric dentist and also orthodontists who deal with children all the time. I have devised a method where you can bring in the permanent teeth and dole out the space they need. I published an article on this, about 45 years ago and its still in use. I have several videos that you might like to look at, about how we do pulpotomy and reduce the deciduous cuspid to help bring the teeth in properly.\n[video deleted by admin] MattKW: Thank you, yes, I did watch your video. It looked like a variation of sorts on the idea of serial extractions. The end result of the video appeared to show that the girl had straightish front teeth, but with a deep overbite, so I wonder what benefit on balance has been achieved. I've been in the game for 35 yrs (you for 42 yrs), so we have almost equivalent experience with the changes that have occurred orthodontically. I have passed through the serial extraction phase, the 1st premolar extraction phase, and the 2nd premolar extraction phase. The latest techniques mean that rarely are extractions required, which I accept give a much better experience for all (I always disliked taking out healthy premolars), and a more pleasing aesthetic and functional result."

But you build the retainer with acrylic pads in the gaps that you have, that occlude against the upper or lower teeth. They donot let the opposite teeth from the gap move into the gap and they donot let the teeth on the either side move toward one another until you can afford to put bridges or implants in these gaps.\n\nIf you donot retain it properly, the teeth on either end will move into the gap and the tooth above or below will move into the gap also.\n\nIf you are thinking of getting the suck down retainers, they are cheap and they don't do a good job at all.\n\nRetainers acts like a temporary partial."

It is 1st PREMOLAR of all quadrants. It ensures a 'space' for each jaw line (upper & lower). It is a normal case to create space for 'crowding' tooth. And this space is used to correct malignment of tooth, which fit in gap for a natural smile. Just maintain brushing technique and rinse properly with antiseptic solution (mixed with water-logged 3 times a day). Avoid sticky food, chocolates, sweets, junk foods etc. Follow dentist's instructions. AndyPandy: Great, thanks.\n\nHow does the gap left by the 1st premolar get \"used\".  I thought the hole left would need to be filled in with say an implant or something.  Is it the case that the gap heals and eventually fills up on its own, is there a name for the process? Raj Kumar Bhushan: Well, can you send me a snap of patient's mouth to know the exact situation?\n      Orthodontic treatment included surgery (implant etc., If it is then only done after completion of Ortho treatment.

I.e. extracted tooth due to several decay, loosening of gums which can't hold tooth any more, trauma etc. But implant can be done at any part of life. As old people gets full mouth fixed denture based on implant abutment) periodontal treatment (gums- flap surgery), Endodontic (filling, RCT etc.).\n      Also apart from braces, a dentist uses external or internal appliances to correct malposition, either skeletal (bone) or dental.\n     It is a basic rule of Ortho to either create or fill gap. And 1st pre molar is a natural choice. The applied physical forces due to braces (which dentist tighten time to time, and it causes strain Everytime patient visit to dentist but disappear soon) and/or appliances causes tooth to be aligned with desired shape.\n      Ortho treatment needs several x-rays. Panaromic, lateral, individual (choice of dentist if any defect), CT scan (if any doubt or study) etc. Then dentist study on it. On a transparent paper diagram is drawn. Then strategy is made. And it takes time. From 6 months to few years, depends upon what is goal.

In expansion it holds the braces (band is placed around this tooth mostly) for fixed Orthodontic (braces) treatment. Hence any dentist wait for eruption of Second Molar to begin treatment. If this molar is tilted or maligned then, treatment can't be done. Second molar gives more stability, support and force sharing to 1st molar during fixed treatment. If elastic or Anchorage need to be placed, 2nd molar shares pressure of 1st molar which is tooth for mastication/grinding food and 'very important'. Band can be given  to 1st molar too but in my view wait for some time and tell me any changes due to already having appliance in her mouth. Any before & after appliance snaps?

Expansion usually starts about 8 years old after the 1st molar erupts, and well before the 2nd molar erupts. And bands for braces always need the 1st molar, not the 2nd. An orthodontist isn't waiting for the 2nd molar to erupt, they're waiting for the premolars and canines to erupt. AndyPandy: She's been to an orthodontist for about two years now, had one set of braces for about a year and then moved to the current ones.  They're planning to do the extractions over the summer and then insert the fixed braces.  I've asked a couple of times of what is going on in detail but I can't say I've yet had a satisfactory answer.  Just want to make sure everything (including the extractions) are being done for a medical reason.\n\nIn your opinions does it look like extractions are going to be unavoidable?

Did I support to place 1st molar band or not?\n     Depends upon cases a band is placed or a dentist wait for treatment. The best time to place fixed braces is '10-14' yrs.

I said to wait for merely another 6 months to attain that age and by then everything will be clear. Appliance change is ok. It means they got desired space. So they changed new appliance. This I wanted to know.\n    Anterior crowding needs to create space. So by extracting they shall make space to pull back tooth in jaw line. It is ok.\n     Extracting 1st pre molar is ok.  There is no as such treatment available to create space simply. Jaw line has limited area (you can check by yourself. Tell her to open mouth. Have disposable gloves and check the upper jaw line. Posterior side you shall not find back space.\n      Imagine if any appliance works to pull it further back, what may happen..last tooth come out of jaw line Also what about wisdom tooth space, which comes by 20-23?).\n      Which month is your next appointment (when is summer)? AndyPandy: The next appointment is due in mid-June, and they're thinking of doing the extractions in July and then the fixed braces in late July or early August.

I too know enamel erosion may cause by acidic/citric food, if taken directly for long time. > 2000mg/day vit-C may be harmful to body. But not clear connection. It may cause oxalates formation in kidney, indigestion, distress etc. Vit-C high dose is good for Intelligence, blood iron absorption. It is water soluble, so not to worry. Average 1000 mg/day can be taken either safe.\n       FDA latest- Mercury vapour does release from Mercury of Amalgam. Though it is considered ok for child & adult. But FDA doesn't deny any Mercury related no possibility of lung disease (by release of vapour from Amalgam). So it is people's choice. Take Amalgam restoration at your own risk.\n       Calcium importance for body--- hope you study medical journal, how much daily calcium is required for \"maintaining bone density\" for an adult and a kid. Tooth comes under this too. Calcium is the prime mineral needed by body. Unless bone density loss leads to fragile bone, may leads to osteoporosis. Dose should not exceed maximum. On an average, it 'must' be taken by people (ask Dr./dentist for required dose). Raj Kumar Bhushan: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHer teeth are already formed.

Dr. Abram Hoffer & Dr. Hugh riordon supported evidence at Mayo clinic. Mayo clinic tried to reject theory by claiming low dose of vit C but failed. Doses by injection or oral causes huge difference in body. So oral is not rejected. Rene  Debos, biologist supported theory after decades of practical done on patients. Human would have a reserve of vit C (40 gms) in our body, mostly in adrenal cortex. Hence high doses just flow out of body because it is 'water soluble'.

    "dialogue": "TaeTae: I went to the dentist last Thursday to get fillings in my first molar (I guess that's what it's called) on the bottom right, and my dentist mentioned that my second/12 year molar is coming in. I already know a tooth was coming in there, but I thought it was my wisdom tooth. I didn't even know a second molar existed. But since that appointment, I've had pain in the back of my gums (like where my tongue is, not just the back of my mouth) where that tooth is coming in. I suspect, and my dentist said this as well yesterday when I went to find out what was wrong, that the tooth is coming in at a slight angle and is kinda going through the side, which is why it hurts.\n\nThe problem is: my dentist didn't tell me ANYTHING about how I can relieve the pain or swelling. The farthest back part of my gums is swollen and I keep getting sharp, cramp-like pains (it's like a cramp in the way that it feels tense I guess but not that bad) where that little flap of skin is under the tongue, right next to the teeth. I'm not sure if you know what I mean, but I don't know the first thing about terms for the mouth. I'm more focused on other parts of the body.\n\nSo my question is: how can I relieve the pain in the back of my gums? It's really frustrating because I can be eating and get that sharp pain and I noticed that if I talk, I sometimes get the pain. I'm really desperate for relief. I've tried cold drinks, and even ice and ice cream, but the first molar (the one that was filled) is sensitive to cold, so it's really painful.\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any advice I can get. I've never had trouble with that tooth up until now, and it's been coming in for a while. I hope I explained this well enough for you guys to understand. It's a little hard to explain. Busybee: I don't think there is much you can do other than taking a recommended level of painkillers.   I remember the horrible pressure when my wisdom teeth came through and that flap of skin.   But I was happy to have more teeth despite the headache.  I am assuming that if your dentist didn't say anything negative that it's coming through without impacting or any complications.   People suggest bonjella and all sorts but perhaps you can try teething gel (the stuff they give babies).   Swish with some chilled chamomile tea or sage tea if you can get hold of it.  You could just buy some sage and make an infusion.  If you continue to suffer or develop a fever go to your dentist to make sure it's all coming through as expected.

You have orthodontic relapse and now need retreatment. $3k for Invisalign is a low fee.  We charge $6K.

    "dialogue": "Joel Ruiz: I won’t get into why I did any of this yet, but I cut my top retainer with scissors; so that they only fit up to my canines. Then I sanded the retainer down on the top (with sand paper) so that only half of the retainer was left from top to bottom. I then wore that retainer along with a fully intact bottom retainer and clenched a lot. My upper teeth moved up into my gums and i now have a speech impediment or something. I can’t talk the same at all. Busybee: Your speech will adjust but you should go and see an orthodontist to get a new retainer made.  Maybe if you post a photo one of the dentists can advise you on the outcome. Joel Ruiz: I am wondering if braces could help move my teeth back to a normal position. From what i remember, braces can move teeth sideways or forward/backwards. But can they move them downward? Out of the gums? My teeth look even straighter now than they used to (after incident). They look perfect, which is why it’s hard to get people to understand what happened. I can still talk. Just not the same. My front teeth also hit or (make impact while i talk). I have yet to see anyone about this with the struggles of life and lack of insurance etc. I’m now in AIT for the Army and am trying to plan things out now that I have insurance and some money giving me the ability to hopefully do something to fix this. I’m embarrassed to admit that i joined the army for this reason only. After losing plenty of jobs and losing lots of confidence i needed a last resort. I’m still myself. Just can’t talk the way i used to and I feel it when I smile/eat/clear my throat/swallow... everything. Busybee: Are you able to post a photograph? Joel Ruiz: Im the first and third picture i am biting with my front upper and lower teeth only. I am biting all the way down in the second picture. When i bite down with my front teeth i feel lots of pressure and does cause pain sometimes Busybee: You'd probably need to post an xray if you want one of the dentists to comment.  Your teeth look good but your smile looks very tense in the pics.  It's as though you are very uncomfortable with what's happened.  I'm sure if you go to a dentist they could give you a new retainer that's longer than your current teeth.  This may encourage them to erupt back.\n\nSo why did you do this? Joel Ruiz: I just wanted the retainer to feel more like an older one i had which had thinner plastic. It’s very complicated. I didn’t realize what I was doing. It’s been a couple of years now and my last resort was to join the military. I’ve struggled with depression for awhile now. I stay fit and eat as healthy as possible to avoid feeling depressed. I feel completely hopeless at times. Nobody who I know understands or really believes what I try to explain to them. They laugh it off and always say the same exact  thing. You’re teeth look fine. I just want to be able to talk like normal again. It’s not really about looks anymore. I want to fix this. I feel like i’m getting so much closer. I lost everything. My job my car repossessed. All my friends and my family. If i could just get some help and a spark of hope i know that i could start to fix my life. Busybee: Did you feel happy before this happened to your teeth? Joel Ruiz: I became obsessed after i lost the retainer i had before all this. It was a thin plastic essix retainer. It was old and the part of the retainer that covered my molars had become cracked and eventually snapped off. I had used this retainer this way for years and it worked fine. When i lost it i went to my orthodontist a few months later (so my teeth shifted quite a bit) and he made me some free retainers with a much thicker plastic. These are the retainers i tampered with. Well the top one anyway Busybee: So are you still wearing the retainer you altered?"

So I really don't know what you think. Opinions? Busybee: A dentist wanted to remove my wisdom teeth when I was 25.  I refused.  I had them sealed and they haven't decayed.   A lot of dentists think that they interfere with the bite.  In my experience if your bite is comfortable be very careful about changing it.  Some who have had their wisdom teeth removed feel it changes their appearance.  Some who have ortho say the same thing.   If you do have any orthodontics go to a specialist.  There is something I'd call a textbook bite, but many dentists are coming around to the opinion that if someone is comfortable with their bite then that's their best bite to have.   Once you start changing everything you can create other problems which can be irreversible. MattKW: Show us an OPG Xray.

According to patient doctor has performed numerous procedure to the tune of 10 000.00 euro, these include veneers (spelling?) bridges, crowns & \"cutting of the nerves of the lower jaw\". Please note that the current dentists father also treated the same patient for a period of 6 years prior start of seeing current dentist about 2 years ago.  Again, according to patient this was for chewing mostly on the right side. Thus a total of 8 years of dental treatment. Now, the referral stated right posterior rotation of O/C1, requested treatment to improve orientation to neutral in order to facilitate use of permanent splint for patient. Patient concerns were pain in cervical and upper thoracic spine due to repetitive clenching/chewing, especially worse in morning after breakfast but thinks he mostly chew on right side. Patient also considers there to be a lack of sensation of where his lower jaw is (following cut of nerve), thus resulting in increased bite pressure because he is can not \"feel\" lower jaw. The patient does not want any manual physiotherapy to either cervical or thoracic. The patient noted that he is a very \"sensitive\" person from birth as his mother had to write a note to his teacher to inform her of this sensitivity. He hag a CABG 5 years ago, with full recovery.The patient informs that he is active in society, was participating in world championship of wind gliding planes and runs a successful business, employing 15 persons. He was very apprehensive regarding active cervical motion, palpation of the TMJ or spinal joints. He was repetitively swallowing though no other symptom of cord compression. He was also not comfortable to undress to expose his trunk. I think he demonstrates signs of central sensitisation.

Janet Two Hawks: No, it’s not treated differently.  Orthodontic treatment is orthodontic treatment.  \nAs a thirty-year veteran of orthodontics, I feel compelled to mention that Invisalign is a “tool” and not a “product”.  Our practice currently has five patients whose Invisalign did not go well with their dentist and needed to be re-treated for a host of problems.  Their dentists (all) let the Invisalign technicians set their cases up for them, when problems arose they didn’t have the training to problem solve them.  They were all skilled dentists, but not orthodontic residency training.   I guess I’m just saying, use caution and pick your cases wisely.   Best of luck."

I was told I should wear braces for 1 year, which I thought was a bit long since it concerned one tooth only but I'm not the orthodontist so I said yes. I was also told I will have a retainer at the end of the treatment behind the top teeth to prevent them from moving again. Now after 2 months my teeth are already realigned and I'm happy with the result. What would be the consequences if I ask the braces to be removed and have the maintainer directly? I really don't wanna wear braces for an extra 10 months since my teeth are straight now, but I don't know what the consequences would be (if there are any).

We were told she needs to remove 2 teeth to make room for the canines to come down but I'm really reluctant for them to remove any teeth unless it's the last option. I read about palate expanding to make room and mentioned this to the consultant but she said there's no room for that procedure? I thought the whole point of this is to make room? Should we get a second opinion or just trust her? \n\nThanks Janet Two Hawks: One of the problems with using maxillary expansion (upper expander) if the jaw itself is not too narrow, is it will then not coordinate with the lower arch and, you can actually expand the teeth so much the roots are too close to the edge of the bone.  If the crowding is so severe that the canines are crowded out of the dental arch, it is usually advisable to extract two bicuspids.  I'd trust that, but get a second opinion if it makes you feel better.   Best of luck."

Basically, your upper jaw grew downward and more forward than your lower jaw.  While it’s true that surgery is the only thing that will correct THAT, orthodontists solve problems like yours every day with braces, and sometimes extractions.  While root resorption can happen, it often never happens in the hands of capable orthodontists.  I disagree with Busybee. In 30 years in the industry I have never had a patient regret getting a healthier bite they can be proud to smile about!   Consequently, we see a lot of adults older than you with a host of dental problems from untreated overbites.  You’re a young, attractive guy.  Get the treatment and cross it off your list!

I wore them for years, lost them, and finally found them again. \n\nI started noticing that my top front teeth were \"clicking\" and thinking something was extremely wrong I scheduled a dentist appointment to make sure everything was okay. In my fear of them falling out or being loose I finally located my own retainers. Cleaned them extremely well and tried to wear them, thinking something was better than nothing.  \n\nI haven't had my braces for a least 12 years. The bottom retainers pretty much fit perfectly still because I have a permanent placement bar on the bottom. The tops were not fitting completely but, like I said, something had to be better than nothing. So I wore them and pain! teeth were so sore it was ridiculous but I was like they would be sore if they are moving! \n\nAfter the dentist appointment they said I shouldn't wear them anymore since the top ones weren't fitting right. But now after wearing them for awhile I definitely feel like my top teeth have shifted. It feels like my bite is off now, my jaw \"clicks\" sometimes when I yawn, and I can definitely tell one of my top teeth is moving sideways/back a bit. Mouth still looks good and you can't really tell/see anything. But I KNOW. I can feel it. \n\nMy question is when I go to an orthodontist consult do you think it would be an easy fix where I could maybe just get invisilign and maybe just for the top? Or does it sound like there could be something worse going on? Any help would be appreciated. Sorry for all the information. Lyle MacLeod: I'm not a orthodontist but it's doesn't sound like there's something serious going on, maybe your jaw is just getting use to the recent change in alignment and your bite seems off because it's been so long since it was in the \"right\" position.

Please note that there is a childhood tooth (a small one) that's is a leftover and needs to be extracted. Any ideas or recodomendations? I was also aiming for lingual braces but I was told this is a complicated situation so lingual braces is a not a option. Dasha: Hello-\n\nThis is treatable using orthodontics, but would most likely also require jaw surgery because of how elongated the lower jaw is. Are all your wisdom teeth completely erupted? Are you planning on doing an implant/bridge on your lower right missing molar? Veneers are quite pricy, around $1,000 a tooth and require maintenance throughout the years (about every 10-15 years the veneers will perhaps need to be replaced). They also completely alter the shape of your natural tooth. \n\nCall a few orthodontists in your area- nearly all orthodontists offer free consultation initial exams where they can help you figure out if orthodontics is the right path for you. Best of luck! webmaster786: Invite multiple orthodontists in your area - almost all orthodontists offer free counseling examinations to help you determine if orthodontics are the right way for you.

It's Friday - i saw my Orthodontist on Tuesday and my wires went up a size/strength - I've notice almost an instant shift in my teeth (upper jaw) - however i feel like I have flu like symptoms. I have a post nasal drip, sinus congestion and a runny nose. Otherwise i feel fine. Is there any known relation between braces and teeth movement affecting your sinuses?? I am also due to have my lower jaw broken and realigned in 8 to 12 months - could my overbite make things worse?\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?\n\nCan someone let me know?\n\nThanks calcium48: its possible.\nAs the whole area is inter-connected"

    "title": "How can I adjust my bottom flipper?",
    "dialogue": "Lucas: I was born missing one tooth (the tooth to the left of the middle two), and so when my orthodontist gave me braces, he also used them to create a space for a fake tooth. That tooth just sat on the braces but when  I got the braces off, I got given a bottom retainer with one tooth attached to it, and two little metal pieces sticking out on both sides. I think it's called a flipper. At first this fit fine, but recently it became extremely loose in my mouth, and pretty much just rests on my gums. The metal pieces are offering no tightness for the tooth. The last time I went to see my orthodontist, he told me there was a way to tighten the retainer myself, and it involved adjusting the metal pieces. So far, i have had no luck, however, I manipulate the metals. Is there something I'm doing wrong, or any way to tighten the retainer without going in to see my orthodontist every time? Any help would be much appreciated."

I have worn retainers since then and my teeth over the years have just gotten worse and worse.  I have also noticed that my jawline has expanded since I had my wisdom teeth removed just before I got my braces (not sure if that has anything to do with it).\n\nI did not pay attention too often to how badly they have shifted until I started noticing that I had been taken selfies with my head tilted to the side subconsciously to hide my uneven smile.  At first I thought it may be the muscles in my face causing my smile to appear crooked but it seems that one side of my teeth are almost smaller and less bucked than the other.  My dentist has never commented on the unevenness of my teeth. \n\nCould this be corrected with a simple fix of my retainer, should I get invisalign  or braces, or should I speak with a periodontist or both? \n\nAny information or advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\n(Pictures are attached below)\n\nAll of these are recent pictures (taken within 3 days of eachother)\n\nYou can notice how quickly my teeth shift because in the third picuture I had been actively wearing my retainers.

I didn't end up going ahead with it because I got 2 very different opinions on if I needed extractions or not. I am now 26  and my teeth are pretty much the same apart from I think they may have very slightly shifted forward ( i will attach a photo). I am looking into getting them straightened again now and since then a lot of dentists in my area are using invisalign. I saw one guy that only did invisalign and thought he could achieve a straight smile without extractions and another guy who offers traditional braces also. The second said that it would be hard to straighten my teeth without extractions and that without the space created from extractions it would be much harder to achieve a good result and it may cause an un natural protruding look. as you can see from the photo of my profile I have nice volume to my face and i fear that removing teeth would cause me to lose this volume and look aged. I also wouldn't want to spend a lot of money for the treatment to not be successful and end up having to have teeth extracted anyway. Any comments would be greatly appreciated."

You would be on medication for a period of around 5 days after surgical extraction which would solve the issues permanently. Hope this will solve your issue."

They wouldn't suggest shaving/filing a tooth without reason to believe it would cause any harm to your teeth. Look into cosmetic contouring. you will find some interesting stuff. Chicago Girl: Contouring the front teeth to make them more even is something that definitely can be done. But only so much of the tooth can be removed safely. My son had his front teeth uneven and the Ortho kept saying they were fine just like your ortho. I wouldn't accept that and went to another ortho for another opinion. New ortho instantly said not only were uneven but slightly slanted. He bent the wire to make the tooth not slant and the bottom edge of tooth was straight and not slanted within days! No contouring needed. Ask your ortho if your tooth is slanted. drmins: It definitely needs to be corrected orthodontically. Overall, its not a bilaterally even smile."

I'm 32 years old and haven't had my wisdom teeth removed yet. I wanted to have the teeth removed before I got the braces on but the orthodontist told me it was fine to put the braces on with the wisdom teeth. Also, I needed 2 of my lower teeth extracted and was told I needed braces on before the teeth could be extracted. Every person I talked to who had braces, said their wisdom teeth were removed first and their teeth were extracted. So why did my orthodontist put my braces on with all of those extra teeth still in my mouth? I have crowding and a very small mouth. The reason I had to get the braces taken off because of the amount of pain I was experiencing was unbearable. I felt like I couldn't breath because my mouth and lips were so swollen. I believe that having the teeth still in place with the braces putting pressure on them was too much for my mouth. I also had these things placed on my lower two front teeth to make them not move until my 2 extractions which caused a lot of pain. However, the orthodontist told me that it was normal to feel that pain. My pain wasn't getting any better and the swelling was only getting worse that I made the choice to have them taken off because I was truly worried what it was doing to me. I couldn't eat or sleep and was only taking excedrin to help the pain. The excedrin caused me to bleed when I went to the bathroom because there was no food in my stomach. I have pictures of what my mouth looked like if I get another orthodontists opinion. I really don't trust any doctors now so I'm hoping someone reaches out to me on this forum."

I was already missing the back molar next to it that's been gone for years.\n\nI got the bad tooth pulled and 2 bone grafts (Cadaver bone),  for future implants.\n\nI was not informed about a \"sinus lift\"procedure but partway into the surgery the oral surgeon said it was needed.  Something seemed to go wrong. He started yelling to his assistant the the membrane was folded back and to get some tool right away.  That was where the first tooth (next to last molar) was pulled I think.  On the graft for the back molar he had trouble getting it to bleed enough.  Many years ago I had a bone infection there after sinus surgery to open up my sinuses.\n\nHe also told me the tooth he pulled was a \"tough\" extraction.  It hurt much more than the earlier extraction years ago.  The \"tap\"for the sinus infection was excruciating and I finally yelled for him to stop.  I had a car accident injury a year ago that included a concussion and blurred vision for a year that only recently stopped after a nerve block and I was afraid he was going to reinjure that,  there was so much pain and pressure.So he used a tool and wrestled and wrestled to get that tooth out.\n\nAfter the surgery I kept having bits of bone come out, including one fairly large chunk, swelling and pain.  I've been on Doxycyclin since a few days before the surgery as the tooth was infected. This is the only antibiotic  I can safely take;  I have allergies to 5 or 6 others.\n\nWhen I went back for the 2 week checkup he said there is a \"hole\" forming.It looks brown inside and there's a huge gap up the side of my gums.  I asked if they could add more bone graft or if it needs to be reopened and he said no,  to come back again at 4 weeks; he did not remove stitches.\n\nI am still having constant drainage down the back of my throat from the sinus so apparently it's still infected or the sinus is, and I'm nearly out of antibiotic. I'm concerned infection may be sealed up in there now.  He thinks there will be enough bone for the implant but I am skeptical.  It still hurts a lot,  3 weeks after surgery and my cheek still has some swelling.\n\nWhat should I do?  I am in the San Diego inland area.\n\nI am now terrified of dentists after so many screwups.  I've lost 2 molars,  each because endodontists missed extra roots that were not filled.  I've had sinus surgery 15 years ago that left me with a necroiizing bone infection and all the antibiotics I had to take is what started triggering many allergies.  And now this. How can I get the infection/drainage cleared up with so many allergies(there's basically no other antibiotic I can safely take)?  What should be done about the \"hole\" and how do I know the membrane was properly repaired?\n\ni am losing my dental insurance at year's end so if there's any expensive x-rays  or short-term procedures needed I want to get it done now and not wait. Already the future implants will be on my dime.\n\nI'm 59 and in otherwise good health. One other concern: I just read on your site that some membranes used are collagen.  I had a reaction once to a facial product and the beautician said  I might have a collagen allergy."

    "title": "Braces more damaging than good?",
    "dialogue": "k22: Hello,\nI am on the NHS treatment for braces which I got near the end of last year. I didn't have any crowding or spaces in my teeth I just had one canine teeth on the right that over bit the top teeth which had a really tiny dent however it was really subtle and I didn't feel that it was a big issue. Since I had told this to my dentist she suggested to me that  I could go to the orthodontists and so I did. However I didn't expect things like gum recession as I hadn't really know about these things from the orthodontist or the dentist. my orthodontist even asked me once into the treatment that due to the natural arrangement of my teeth she cant really get my teeth that straight unless I extract two teeth I didn't really want to extract my teeth so she said she cant get them to the \"ideal\" straightness\nI first got braces on the top and then got the bottom ones she said she put braces on the top to see if my bottom teeth adjusted naturally but since they didn't I now have braces on the bottom teeth however I now have gum recession on the other left canine and also since she cant get them that straight my original issue of biting the top teeth from the right canine remains.  I am really annoyed because before braces my teeth weren't that bad, there was no staining and now while biting I feel its wonky and top is shifted to the right while the bottom slightly to the left which makes biting quickly hard also since I have only 3 months left I thing the final arrangement will be quite close to the current arrangement. my teeth also look as if they are stretched out of their gums and taller which after braces I don't think will make them look good\nIs there any way I can reduce the gum recessions while the orthodontist continues to tighten them. also I 've herd braces don't change the change the shape of teeth permanently does that mean after braces if I don't wear retainers my teeth will return to their original place and the gum recession will go away because I desperately want that now.\nThanks for the any responses"

    "dialogue": "akademiaramn: I have a problem with the jaw joint. Slightly shifted to the side, not more than a few millimeters. Is it true that the Invisalign braces can correct it without surgery. My doctor said that it will help, but i am not sure. \n\nThanks for help. RIDER89: Better you take a second opinion from another doctor. PlacidWay-US: Hi akademiaramn, I agree with @RIDER89 you may also want to seek a second opinion but to give you an insight about Invisalign braces it is a relatively new idea in orthodontics. Invisalign is a clear plastic mold that aligns the teeth without the use of braces. After obtaining impressions of the mouth, the orthodontist will use a computer to create clear retainers that will progressively align the teeth. The first retainer fits the teeth in the beginning of the treatment, and the following retainers will work to move them into alignment with gentle pressure. While each individual may use a different number of retainers until they achieve the result they want, it generally takes between 18 and 30 retainers to complete treatment. Each retainer is worn for two weeks before the next one is used. So it's a yes that with invisalign there's no need for a surgery. dentalimplantslondon: As per my suggestion you also contact another professional dentist to get remedies. Gatorgirl21: No no no! Invisalign was created for intentions to correct most just minor adjustments cosmeticly. Shifting a midline & jaw requires electics in specific configurations over ur treatment to fix it even if it's very very little. U can't place hooks to hook elastics on Invisalign. The hook goes on specific teeth for pressure from shift that specific tooth or teeth in a certain way depending on how the Ortho has u wearing them"

    "dialogue": "Punkick7: Im 19 years old and im having problem in puttin' on the braces.. My teeths are outta their place and position, not that bad like most people have but, still it is slightly moving outta its positions.. I have a supernumeral teeth too.. One consultant told me that braces for me is optional, but warned me that they would have to remove four teeths ( 2 from above and 2 from below ) from my mouth.. Another consultant from same clinic said that i need to wear braces compulsorily and i would have to get 4 teeths removed ( extracted ) .. two of my friends just put on the braces without removing 4 teeths ( their doctors still recommended to extract but my friends denied to do so ). the problem is, as my teeths are only bad to some extent, ( not worse ) i dont want 4 of my teeths to get removed.. but i still feel that moving my teeths back is good.. One of those two friends was in the same position as im now, his teeths were not worse, but kinda moving outta its place, so he just had to wear braces for 3 months ( his first doctor told him to remove 4 teeths, but his other doctor told him that it wont be necessary, so he put on the braces as such ) My second consultant now tells me that i have to wear it 1 1/2 years -_- and im doing my 2nd year in the college now.. \n\nIm in a state of total confusion now.. i wanna wear braces ( cuz it'll make me look good afterwards ) but i dont want my 4 teeths to get removed.. Whats the harm in not removing 4 teeths??.. Please do help me, thanks in advance! \n\n P.S : - ( im facing other issues too, one of my two front teeths are white and other teeths are yellow in colour, im trying hard to brush, but still only ( one of ) my front teeth is white.. What shall i do for this? )\n\n( Before consulting doctors, i heard that pushing your teeths voluntarily backwards would help it move back in its place.. i did it so hard for months ( both, with my fingers and, with placing my jaw over window wall and pushing my face against it )  Now it did that so hard that, a small part of one of my front tooth broke.. Now its look bad.. What shall i do for clipped teeth.. Do dentists level that out perfectly? Punkick7: ?? PlacidWay-US: Hmmm you should ask you dentist, since you said they are telling you that before having braces they need to do teeth extraction, WHY is it? Is it damaged/chipped? If not then why they would do the extraction? You should make things clear before deciding since  braces improves the alignment of the teeth. Matthew Richardson: Get a second opinion and ask questions. For me when I got braces I had to have 1 tooth extracted from my bottom front because of overcrowding, basically the top and bottom wouldn't fit together if they left it in, so extraction is sometimes necessary. I'm confused why they would have to remove 4 teeth though, that seems excessive but definitely get a second opinion. Gatorgirl21: I had 4 teeth extracted right after having braces placed 12 years ago bc of the crowding then had my wisdom teeth (only had 2 - both upper never developed the 2 lowers) extracted within less than a month after finishing treatment & had my braces removed well before any signs of them erupting bc of crowding. My Ortho didn't want any chance of them starting to shift down even though it'd be like 10 yes if at all of them erupting & mess up what I had braces to correct. \n\nNow 12 years after my 1st set of braces I've gone to school & been working for about a year as an RDA. Very end of June I had a 2nd set of braces placed by my Ortho to fix some cosmetic things that I bc I work in dentistry noticed & attempt to adjust my jaw alignment to prevent surgery further down the road for TMJ & Bruxism. Recently switched to Ortho from general & YESS ITS NECESSARY. It's very common to have teeth removed that are completely healthy to allow space to fix crowding in several Ortho cases.\n\nWithout an X-ray I'm not sure where ur supernumary teeth lay in alignment to your roots from the teeth u have already erupted in your mouth. Pulling the super teeth into ur occlusion is necessary depending on how the 2 align. It's to prevent later down the road over the years from it shifting trying to erupt & knock out 3 teeth that you've taken care of to keep healthy. Go with the Ortho who wants extractions & shift supernumary teeth. Years down the road from now you'll be very thankful for that Doctor all that stuff even though u just wanted a little cosmetic fixes from braces now."

    "dialogue": "Gatorgirl21: Is it possible to fracture a tooth under a bracket on the facial surface only?!?!\n\nI've worked as an RDA for almost a year now so I've gained knowledge on several different types of dentistry except orthodontics. I recently started my dream job as an OA last Monday for a local orthodontist so I'm just know learning a lot of things about the field. I also have been using a family friend that's a local Ortho my entire life. He did my first set 12 years ago and placed the set I have now at the end of June. My new boss was completely understanding bc of how extensive my first time in braces was and how close I am to completing this set of braces as well as the connection I have with \"his competition\". \n\nI was a non compliant PT my first round so after 5 years in assuming the fam friend \"completed TX\" bc my parents and of course I was satisfied. But now being in dental field & understanding the complications of clenching grinding & jaw alignment I became worried about my jaw joint pain & chose to get another set to fix the pain & do it right this time. \n\nI had an exam the week before having my braces put on and about 2 weeks ago. So I know even if I believe my hygiene is top knotch I don't have any decay or cavities. This morning I drank the first sip of my \"daily\" Diet Coke and fell to my knees in shooting pain from the temp change to the facial/occlusal area of 27& 29 (missing 28 from Exts bc of crowing issues). Long story short (sorry for the rant but I'm sorta despreate here).:,( at lunch I texted my general dentist about it & he's outta town til late Sunday so he couldn't help a sista out. I felt bad asking my new boss (that's leaving town tonight until Wednesday for his anniversary) to remove a bracket check it out \"maybe find the issue\" bc we only have a pano and facials aren't really gunna show on xrays anyways. my fam friend Ortho who's done all my Ortho treatment is out til Tuesday so he can't help a sista either. \n\nI haven't been able to eat or drink all day bc of the shooting pain. So I swapped my pride & called the office I worked at up until starting OA job. We took PAs & a pano. Of course everything looks normal. Without being able to see under the bracket me & him decided to add to a filling to knock my occlusion out of line while my jaw is shifting from my Ortho TX & hopefully that'll fix it threw till I see one of the other 3. We tried endo ice tooth tapping.. All we could without having to remove or re bond a bracket.  \n\nI've been unable to make contact on the occlusion of my teeth since I had these braces put on except for on my central & lateral incisors. Within the last week or so I've noticed almost all my teeth are touching again. With new alignment & my teeth tapping at different places than what I have been all these years I've probs just grinded or clenched wearing the \"fresh surface\" down & it's sensitive after a serious nights sleep of grinding which happens when I don't sleep very well at night. \n\nGet home after the emergency LOE & filling take a sip of water & I dropped to my knees again. I have no clue what it could be besides maybe a fracture under the bracket (honestly think it's just 27 but the pain radiates enough it kinda feels like it might be 29 too). Is that even possible?!?! Or what else could it be?! \n\nOn the bright side I'll lose some weight this weekend not being able to eat or drink LOL. & any ideas to what could be wrong would be AWESOME. I've never had more than a few occlusal fillings & even working in dentistry knowing solutions I'm terrified of crowns root canals & even having to have an EXT. Can chairside (damn near think I may be able to successfully preform some cases without a DDS ... Jk) all day long, think pts over react bc after the shot it's a walk in the park besides a little bit of pressure if the shots done correctly but TERRIFIED of actually being the patient. (& with my autoimmune really weak from a medical condition & being diabetic pretty damn sure my body would totally reject an implant even if the #1 OS preformed the surgery so I ain't even about to consider paying that kinda $$ then play the waiting game)"

I really wouldn't care if it was socially acceptable but I can't even have a serious relationship because girls don't want to commit to a monster looking guy. I'm only 28 and I have no insurance. I've been quoted 10+K to fix my teeth and I can't afford that but I feel like I'm not living my life to the maximum potential and I'm starting to fall into depression because of this. I am probably the happiest person i know but i can never show it because I'm afraid to smile. I'm mentally scarred from all the years of bullying and suppression I've encountered over the years. Please help me. PlacidWay-US: Hi CarlosG, I understand your frustration some people are really cconsciousabout how their teeth looks and in your case you may need orthodontics treatment. The procedure will not just fix the problems with alignment and bite, but also to make your mouth look more aesthetically pleasing. By the way where are you from? you said you had a quote 10K+ i think it's really too much because generally orthodontics can be priced anywhere from $1,700 to $5,600. If I were you I will do more research, try to look into Mexico, as far as I know the cost of orthodontic in Mexico is $400. DanyRoden: Hey Dear, Don't feel bad like this. You have to find some dentistry in your city that treats you without insurance or helps you in dental financing. Hope everything will be fine."

    "title": "Can my retainer cause an impacted tooth?",
    "dialogue": "xxCourt96xx: Hi everybody.\nI had braces for almost 3 years and got them off in March 2014. I have a clear retainer for my bottom teeth and a plastic/metal one for my top teeth and I've done pretty good with wearing them. I still don't fully have my 12 year (second) molars on top- there is really no reason for them being slow, I'm just a late bloomer. A year ago I got all 4 of my wisdom teeth out because my orthodontist/dentist didn't want his work messed up when they started growing in and he figured my 12 year molars would start moving in after the surgery. Which he was right, they've made more progress since the surgery.\n\nThe only problem is I think one of them is becoming impacted because of my retainer. I wear it pretty religiously and it doesn't really have an easy way in because of the metal bar that wraps around my first molar and I think it's starting to turn as it tries to find a way in. There's kind of an unpleasant smell around the gum and a flap of skin covering half the tooth. I honestly thought I'd have this problem with my wisdom teeth, not my teeth that are almost 8 years late, lol.\n\nShould I stop wearing my retainer for awhile to let the teeth grow in? Or should I call up an orthodontist and tell them what's going on? That's another one of my issues, my orthodontist/dentist is a pediatric dentist and I'm 19 so they won't take me anymore I don't think. Jonathan: Hi,\nIt wouldnt be good for you to stop wearing your retainer. I would advice speak to your orthodontist, if he cant assist you(due to your age) he will be able to recommend or refer you to a different orthodontist/dentist.\n\nIf you are going to see a different orthodontist/dentist remember to pick up your files/records from their offices, so that your new dentist can view your history and previous scans.\n\n--\nThanks,\nDr. Jonathan Everett Becky: @Jonathan I have removed your links, but if you would like to become a verified dentist on the forum please check the details in my signature"

I attached a picture. My back teeth don't really touch and it's pretty hard to tear food sometimes, the gap between my front teeth is about 9mm, my left side touches before my right, but if I bite, both will kind of touch. I am happy with the way I look, but I am worried about any functional issues or other symptoms that may occur because of my underbite. I do not want to get surgery. \n\nHowever, my family doctor recommended that I get invisalign or some other treatment to help reduce my underbite and reduce the crowding in my teeth. I am not sure if it is worth the time, she estimated that my case would require about a year and 30 invisaligns (haven't sent in the molds yet). I have been searching for whether people have problems when they get older, but I can't find much on the internet. Most forums are only talking about treatment, not what happens if I don't get treatment. So I am curious what negatives there are for not doing any type of surgery or alignment. Such as are my teeth going to start bending more forward/backward after awhile because they aren't aligned properly and how big of a difference will that make? I am currently 22. \n\n1. What happens if I get no treatment and keep my teeth the way they are, negatives for the future?\n2.

There really isn't much that one could say from simply looking at pictures of your teeth. An overbite can often be treated with ortho, however a crossbite is usually the result of issues with your palatal structure.

    "dialogue": "Blackjaqk: Hello everyone,\nI wanted to ask if I should continue wearing my retainers after I got braces. I am a 16 year old male. The situation is a little complicated, because I have learned that tongue posture affects the development of the maxilla, and my tongue posture used to be bad, which I assume lead to my overbite. While braces have corrected the overbite somewhat by pulling my teeth inwards, the result is that my palate is still rather small. My back teeth are still coming in, and my orthodontist has said he isn't sure how they will turn out since there is little space in the back of my mouth. I think the lack of space is because of my small palate from incorrect tongue posture and open mouth posture. Now, I am wondering whether practicing correct tongue posture would expand my palate a bit so the back teeth could come in correctly. I worry that wearing my retainer will prevent the change I am trying to make. However, I am also worried that if my palate does grow, my bite will be messed up and my teeth will be crooked again. Will this happen, or will tongue posture prevent my teeth from growing crooked?"

Since then, I've had lots of helpful chiropractic treatment to straighten my neck, spine and hips and I've even got some good cracks, correcting a twist in my skull, but I can still feel the immense pressure from my teeth through my temple area on to my neck and back which I continually have to correct using chiropractic techniques. \n\nI'm 46 now and haven't given up because I'd like to have a life and a family but the NHS in Britain does not recognize the condition.

For the past 2 years I have not been wearing the retainer at all, and have noticed gaps beginning to form between some of my teeth. I still have my old retainer, but when I put it on it is a very tight fit. If I were to begin wearing the retainer every night again, would it realign my teeth, or might it be detrimental because it's so tight?\n\nI was 17 when the retainer was made, I am 20 now. Also my dentist said he began to see my wisdom teeth on X-rays he took about a year ago Dr. Garrett Fiorenza: BitewingPilot,\n\nIt is not detrimental to wear your retainer. If the teeth have only moved slightly the retainer can correct the slight movement. Teeth continue to drift throughout life so many people are getting permanent retainers to keep the teeth in their final position. I would ask your dentist if a permanent retainer is a good option. \n\nOn another note. You should definitely consider getting your wisdom teeth removed. Most often these cause much more tooth movement than the natural drift seen over years and years. From my view it sounds like that is an underlying issue that should be taken care of sooner rather than later. Hope this helps,\n\nGarrett Fiorenza, DDS\nFiorenza Dental Group\nwww.fiorenzadentalgroup.com\nGreenwood, IN BitewingPilot: Thank you for the advice! xyz123: I was going to start my own thread but noticed this very similar one, so I figure I'll ask here instead...\n\nI have a similar situation except very extreme, haha. I'm 28 now, and I don't even remember what year I last wore my retainer (I'm thinking like 13 years ago?). I have some crowding that I find very annoying with my lower central incisor. It was a problem for me in the past and my retainer has a kind of spring mechanism that pushes one of these teeth into place.\n\nI still do have my old retainer in it's original case, but I'm wondering if I should use it or if it's even safe to use. From what I've read in this forum it seems that it may be worth trying (let me know if I'm wrong), but one thing that weirds me out is that it has some white plaque looking stuff stuck to it in some areas. The stuff is like cement. I'm assuming when I was a lazy high school kid I didn't clean it as well as I should have, oops. I'm assuming any bacteria wouldn't have survived after all these years anyway, but is there anything I should do to clean it? Zuri Barniv: Hi, there is probably little harm from at least trying it in, but if it is super-tight and hurts a lot, I would forget it. Getting a new retainer made so it doesn't get any worse  is usually not expensive.\n\nThe white stuff is probably tartar which caked on over the time you wore it and it's harmless. \n\nWith all due respect to Dr. Fiorenza in his post above, wisdom teeth do not cause crowding and there is a lot of research that refutes that old wives tale. \nDr. Barniv"

I always have nasal stuffiness like the stuffiness/blockage (not runny or filled with mucus) keeps shifting from one nostril to other. I had myself checked for sinusitis but I didn't had it although doc said it is allergy. It has been more than 5 years since this problem. So i researched and found that narrow palate can cause this- and I have attached the pic for specialist to see whether I have narrow palate. \n\nMy mouth also gets dry when I talk and the tongue starts sticking to soft palate. I do keep getting thin white phlegm which is irritating and during this instance my tongue starts building this white coat on it (Candida?) which stinks and the saliva turns frothy and thick. Although if I don't talk my mouth slowly gets filled with saliva again, especially the mouth floor and because of that I have to intentionally swallow it. \n\nAlso, I have attached some pictures and circled in black- like near my molars the inner side gums are huge. The other picture is about narrow palate (to confirm if i have one), one about tongue (tongue tied ?), and the last one about cheeks inflating inwardly so much that it might come between teeth. One last thing- I have a scalloped tongue (couple of teeth marks) and buccal exostosis (confirmed by dentist).\n\nTl;DR (Summarized Post) - do i have narrow palate? do i have tongue tie? whats wrong with inner cheeks protruding so much? the gums on molars are huge (not swollen) is that ok? tongue seems swollen?"

I have not had a dental checkup since September of 2013 due to my family having to drop Oxford and switch to Medicaid due to financial troubles. My mom learned that braces are FREE, but of course these are only the traditional wire braces. Here is a list of a few dental problems that I have:\n1. Medium sized gap inbetween my front teeth\n2. ONE crooked tooth on the bottom row of my teeth\n3. Chipped tooth\n4. Tooth that needs crowning\nI am not sure if 3 or 4 needs to be resolved in order for the braces to be setup in the first place. but I know that 1 can be resolved by bonding, which leads me to 2. This tooth RECENTLY became crooked. I asked a few people and they didn't notice it until I told them about it, but it kind of bothers me a little. It doesn't physically bother me, but I get slightly overwhelmed when i see it in the mirror. So now here is a list of concerns I have about braces:\n1. The metal braces are noticeable, and very few people my age still have them.\n2. Braces require very high maintenance.\n3. Braces take well over a year to complete.\n4. Once braces are done, I need to wear a retainer and from what I heard, it's for the rest of my life.\n5. I only have one dental issue that can only be solved by getting braces.\n6. My wisdom teeth are currently coming in, Will that conflict with my braces if I do get them?\nSo what would any of you guys do if you were in my position? Can anyone who has experience with braces tell me some experiences they had? Thank you all for your time. Dr. Garrett Fiorenza: Braces are well worth the wait if you do not like the way your teeth look. However, you are right that the other issues need to be taken care of before you start braces. Wisdom teeth can sometimes cause your teeth to crowd and get crooked, so I would also advise getting those removed before starting braces. \n\nI think you should go to an orthodontist (braces dentist) and get a consultation. These are usually cheap and they can tell you all of the risks and benefits to your specific case. They'll take xrays and make sure whether you need braces or not. Hope this helps, \n\nGarrett Fiorenza, DDS\nwww.fiorenzadentalgroup.com\nGreenwood, IN cjstorm: I think I'm gonna go ahead with the braces. Thanks for your response. My case is less serious than others, so they should hopefully be out a year after I get them. I am actually more nervous of getting a regular dentist appointment after over a year rather than getting braces on my teeth."

The first orthodontist we went to looked at her X-rays and moulds etc and advised that there was not enough room to bring the tooth forward and that the options were to take this one tooth out or alternatively take 4 molars out.  He recommended taking out the 1 tooth.  He said that although she would have only 3 teeth at the front and it would create a small overbite he preferred that then taking out 4 teeth.   I got a second opinion and the other orthodontist agreed there was not enough room to bring the tooth forward and that it was either take out the 1 or 4 EXCEPT her preference was to take out 4 molars so that she wouldn't have an overbite/better bite.

In regards to my receding chin (Class II case), all 4 doctors have told me they cannot move my chin forward; they can only push back my upper front teeth. One of them told me I may need to extract 4 teeth, another told me 2 on the top. Last two doctors told me I didn't not need to extract any teeth. They all told me that the changes will be subtle and they will almost be no change to my face and/or jaw structure because I am 17.\n\nNow the real reason I'm started this is to ask if anyone has any experience with a \"functional orthodontist.\" I have browse the net for them and according to various sources, they can actually move the jaw forward by using \"functional applications.\" But even so, there was very limited amount of information about this practice.

    "dialogue": "dentistfinder: Adult tooth loss can be extremely embarrassing. Read about the most common causes tooth loss so you can keep your pearly whites healthy into your senior years.\n\nGum Disease\n\nGingivitis, Periodontitis, and Alveolar Bone Loss\n\nGum disease is a serious condition that affects millions of men, women, and children throughout the world. The gum disease gingivitis is a milder form of gum disease that can be easily treated by adopting a proper brushing and flossing routine. However, if gingivitis remains untreated, it can progress into periodontitis.\n\nPeriodontitis is caused by a severe build-up of bacteria on the teeth and along the gum line that eventually results in bone loss. As the alveolar bone, which supports the teeth, deteriorates, teeth can become loose and fall out. Periodontitis is one of the main causes of tooth loss, especially among adults aged 65 and older.\n\nAccording to an article published in the Journal of Periodontology, you are at increased risk of losing your teeth to periodontitis if you are:\n\nAged 35 and older\nMale\nAvoiding professional dental care\nNot using a toothbrush\nA smoker\nSuffering from diabetes\nSuffering from high blood pressure\nSuffering from rheumatoid arthritis\n\nDental Caries Disease\n\nCavities and Tooth Decay\n\nWhile periodontitis is more likely to lead to the loss of multiple teeth, dental caries can lead to the loss of an individual tooth. Dental caries are caused by the presence of plaque on the tooth’s surface and are most commonly known as cavities or tooth decay. When a cavity initially develops, it damages the outer surface of the tooth. As it continues to break down the tooth’s surface, it gains access to the inside of the tooth, where it can cause significantly more damage and tooth pain.\n\nThe length of time a cavity is left untreated is proportional to the degree of damage sustained by the tooth. If a cavity is detected in its earliest stages, a simple filling may be all that is required for treatment. If the structure of the tooth is severely damaged, a crown or inlay or onlay may be needed to provide additional support to the affected tooth, while root canal therapy may be required to remove damaged areas of the tooth and seal any openings.\n\nIn the most severe cases, the tooth cannot be saved and must be removed. When people lose a tooth to a cavity or some other trauma, dentists strongly recommend that a replacement tooth be used to fill the gap so that surrounding teeth are unable move out of alignment. A dental implant, bridge, or partial dentures can be used to replace missing teeth.\n\nInjury\n\nAuto Accidents, Falls, and Trauma from Sports\n\nAccidents or events that cause sudden impact to the facial area can lead to the loss of a tooth or several teeth. For example, a person can fall on an unforgiving surface such as concrete and snap off the bottom portion of a tooth, permanently damaging the nerves and structure of the tooth. An individual involved in a fist fight could receive a forcible blow to the mouth area that knocks a tooth out of its socket.\nTooth loss from injury can be caused by:\n\nMotor vehicle accidents\nBiking accidents\nFalls\nAssault\nContact sports\n\nPrevention of Adult Tooth Loss\n\nProtecting your teeth from dental caries and gum disease is pretty simple and straightforward. You just need to maintain proper oral hygiene by thoroughly brushing and flossing your teeth twice a day and scheduling dental exams every six months.\n\nProtecting your mouth from injury, however, is not quite as easy because most dental injuries result from accidents. Common sense safeguards are the surest way to protect your teeth in the event of an accident; for example, wearing protective mouth guards while participating in sports, being a safe and attentive driver, and avoiding physical altercations can help you to avoid losing your teeth to injuries. mandy22: Hello\n\nHi Everyone. FamilyOrthodontist: Brushing is important and correct brushing technique is essential. Many do not brush long enough and to make it worse, they don't brush with the proper technique and as a result they are leaving harmful bacterial behind. \n\nAlong with proper technique, I suggest using a good quality mouth wash. LADentalclinic: Fortunately there are much better options for replacing missing teeth than there was in the past.  One of the latest and most ideal are dental implants.  Once restored, they function like natural teeth. gersson: Usually, the teeth nature of each individual will vary from other, consulting a proper orthodontist is the best way for finding the right solution for adult tooth loss. Nicolas: In order to prevent Adult tooth loss, you need to take good care of teeth. I too agree that brushing teeth twice a day is the most effective way to avoid tooth loss. In addition, visiting a dentist for a check up after every two or three months is advisable and get your teeth cleaned up will save you from dental problems."

I noticed that when I bite down only with the right side of my molars there is a gap between the night guard and the upper molar encased(at the very end where the night guard ends). When I bite down with my left molars there is no gap.  So the pressure of my bottom back molars to that of the upper back molars shifts the night guard BACK slightly. This is a problem because the gap puts pressure on my front teeth when biting down. When my jaw relaxes during sleep the very back molars rests on each other causing a slight pull of my front teeth and my front teeth feel sore in the morning.\n\nAlso the night guard seems to make me more aware of my clenching and grinding during sleep, is this normal?

Others, who's teeth begin to move back to where they were prior to braces might have to wear their retainer for years, however, at night only. stevengoldy: Hello, \nI think that the situation of using retainers is depends upon the time consumed by your teeth to repositionized well.

I'd always wondered why my teeth always looked so different and it did not help my self esteem any to finally know what was wrong because I realize it costs thousands of dollars to fix. I am a mother of two and am desperate to find some way to pay for the procedures to have a beautiful smile like the rest of my peers. It seems everyone that I come in contact with has all their teeth perfectly where they should be and its so upsetting. While I understand everyone is different, I feel there is no one else with teeth like mine. Though, I have read online there are, I have never met anyone with this condition.\n\nI am searching for advice on how to fix my teeth and how to afford it without insurance. I just moved into a new area and have had trouble landing a job because I have no one to watch my youngest son. My boyfriend works all day long, but doesn't make nearly enough to afford my problems. This deformity has caused me so much anxiety and depression I just need to start somewhere, I need to get this fixed. Ive never had any friends, I've always felt no one likes me because I look like an ogre....Before I knew what was wrong with my teeth, in middle school, I attempted suicide because of my severe depression over this matter. I am 23 years old and have spent over half my life feeling ugly and worthless, I NEED HELP! If ANYONE has any advice or knows an orthodontist who is caring enough to work with me and my needs, I would be eternally grateful. Finally being able to smile would make me one of the happiest people alive! Ive never been able to smile. I have little to no pictures of my childhood because I've never been able to smile confidently. I really need this, if you have dealt with this or know what I can do, please dont hesitate to share!\nPlease excuse my \"ogre smile\", this is what I have to work with.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nconsult with an orthodontist first"

    "dialogue": "OrthoHelp: Hi,\n\nI live in the UK. I had a tooth extracted following a nasty abscess. Rather than having an implant to fill the gap I decided to have orthodontic treatment to correct some over crowding.\n\nI was advised my treatment would take 2 1/2 years and cost £7.5k (Incognito top teeth,Radiance on the bottom teeth). I was also advised that another tooth on the opposite side of my mouth would need extracting to create space (upper teeth).\n\nI am now 2 1/2 years into my treatment, it should now be complete.The 2 large gaps created by the missing teeth have not closed at all, this is because I have had continual Incognito breakages, approximately 8 breakages of the brackets. I am now being told that my treatment will take a further 18 months IF there are no more breakages. I remember in my original consultation the Orthodontist mentioned putting 'blocks' on my teeth because of my bite. This has never happened and the breakages have been constant.\n\nI am female in my mid 30's and my confidence is shattered because of the missing upper teeth, I never expected to have to endure 4 years (at least!) of braces and missing teeth - my treatment should be finished by now. I am totally self-conscious in work and social settings, I can't smile properly for fear of showing the large gaps and I dread having my photo taken. Aside from all this, the time out of work to go and have the breakages looked at is becoming unmanageable. I also have to be careful what I eat and how I eat it, something I was prepared to do for 2 1/2 years but not 4+ years!\n\nI have 2 questions:\n\n1) Should I be entitled to a complete refund and go elsewhere to finish the treatment ?\n2) If my orthodontist offers the Damon Clear self-litigating braces, would this significantly reduce the time it take to close the gaps compared to Incognito ?\n\nThank you! dr atish malviya: you have not mentioned your age,as age advances density of bone increases ,if after certain age bone becomes dense and teeth are not able to move .so its not a matter of type of braces ,its matter of aging process,may be."

I know braces go for 3-5k. do I need my wisdom teeth out in order to get braces? I also have a tooth that had a root canal done to it without a crown on my lower jaw which the tooth just chipped off today (posted as a picture) and I also have another tooth on my upper row with a hole without any chips yet.I also have a brown spot on my front tooth which I am not sure what the cause is, maybe decay? I brush my teeth twice a day so I'm not sure why I have so many dental problems. Any advice would be kind, thank you.\n\n\ndownload1.jpg Photo by NemesisLQ | Photobucket\n\ndownload.jpg Photo by NemesisLQ | Photobucket freeandhappy: Leave it to the Pros!\n\nFirst off, I applaud you for getting your teeth overhauled. That's a hard decision to come to for so many reasons! The big one, MONEY!\n\nYou're right, braces can cost between 3-5K normally. For all the other work you're looking to have done too- it will cost a pretty penny. It really does NOT have to! AuraOrthodontics: The cost of braces varies depending on how long your treatment will be, the complexity of your case, and the type of braces you choose. For example, standard metal braces are much cheaper than Invisalign or other options. When you go to your first appointment, tell the orthodontist up front that you're concerned about cost and discuss possible financing. I offer a variety of options at my orthodontics practice and I'm sure most orthodontists do as well. MarkSummers: The braces can cost about 5k. Some insurance carriers provide partial coverage for orthodontic treatment stevengoldy: Hello,\nThe overall cost of braces depends upon the complete duration of treatment u need to implement.\nand in other hand it also depends upon, which type of braces you prefered\nif you choose invisalign braces then it will more expensive as compare to traditional metal braces.\n\nBut i will suggest you invisalign braces, because these are the best alternative solution for metal braces. Dalton S. Coutu: It is really remarkable of you to list out every one of your dental problems like this. Not everyone will be able to do that.You need both braces and orthodontic treatment. he braces will cost around 5k, the normal ones, and anything else like the invisalign will cost you more.As for the orthodontic procedures I here that there is no limit. You can spent as much as you like for a cosmetic dental treatment. But since you are only doing to get your teeth corrected and whiten your teeth I won't cost much."

I'd have to examine your teeth to give you a definitive answer. However, in my experience a retainer can sometimes fix the problem at a fraction of the cost. I have had patients who have needed braces for one or two teeth that were \"out of place.\" This was due to their bone structure and the severity of the tooth's displacement. I would definitely see an orthodontist (not just the dentist) and get at least two opinions. If the retainer doesn't work you can always finance braces at a later date. It's worth a shot. LADentalClinic.com: It's probably best to follow the advice of your Dentist, although I a retainer can be effective in moving one tooth. Taking the advice of a dentist who has actually examined your mouth is far better, though. My suggestion, is to raise your concerns with your dentist. Rex Fuller: Like above comments, I think that it is best to listen to your dentist about it. Braces would be better than surgery."

    "dialogue": "kellogg9: Hi!\n\nQuestion:  I have braces but my upper-left canine (tooth #2.3) is a slight mesial rotation towards the palate.  I have been trying to tell my ortho the problem but he doesn't seem to understand what i mean entirely.  He's tried to do a detail bend to correct it but i feel after 3 attempts the bend is not working and my canine is still incorrectly positioned.  So i would like to better describe the problem to him.  So to be clear:\n\nMy tooth #2.3 is mesially rotated towards my palate.  Which means that its distal surface is a tad rotated facially (labially).  So my thinking is it needs a 1st-order rotation bend?  Is that the correct terminology for it?  I say this because 1st order bends are all about step-ins and step-outs and so i am looking to step-out the mesial surface, but at the same time step-in its distal surface.  By doing so at the same tine would result in a rotation around its long axis.   The bend i am thinking would look like this (see attached image).\n\nIs that correct?  If you can give me the problem wording i would say to my ortho that would be great.  Thanks very much!"

I have read that invisalign is great for crowding and horizontal spaces (alignment issues) as well. \n\nI am a current invisalign g4 patient and am in the beginning of my treatment. I have already started to see results. If you are hesitant about results, you can see pictures of results so far on my blog [link below]. You have to \"qualify\" for invisalign treatment so I would ask your ortho if this an option for you. Invisalign has features that gives dentists more control over tothe movement than traditional fixed braces. A clincheck is a visual video computer simulation of your teeth movements that your dentist can show you after you do your impressions. \n\nI am really starting to see results for the first time and I am thrilled. I smile now, which i never did before. I dont bite when i smile yet because i still have a gap but by the end of the treatment, i am sure i will be able to. I hope this helps you make a decision. Best of luck to you. Below is the link to my blog. Because we cannot post links i have seperated the link into pieces but be aware that when you type this link into your address bar on your browser,there are no spaces. http    ://    invisaligng4      .blogspot       .com FamilyOrthodontist: I would suggest Invisalign as well. We achieved outstanding results using it and our patients are very happy during the whole treatment process.\n\nThere is lots of information available online with plenty of before and after pictures. AuraOrthodontics: As the other commenters said, Invisalign is a great alternative. If you are unable to afford treatment, inquire as to whether or not your orthodontist has financing options. I would not buy anything on the Internet that claims to work the same as braces, because you are not an orthodontist and most likely neither is the manufacturer. See a doctor and find out your options. It could be as simple as having a retainer fitted, which is a fraction of the cost. atulmishra: I will suggest you take advices in advance from a Dentist, Also you need to check up your current health status that will decide which procedure is reliable for you..."

    "dialogue": "RJ2000: I got my braces removed many years ago,   6 or 7 to be exact, and I was sent home with a take home whitening kit that used a carbamide peroxide gel, around 22% I believe.  I was instructed to put a small amount in each depression of a retainer I have and use overnight, maybe 2 or 3 nights in a row.  Well it worked fine, with some sensitivity of course, and i wanted to use it again.  I realize that it expires after about 2 years at the max, but i went ahead and used it again as directed for 3 nights.  The kit had 2 syringes, and one was still unused.  I should have just used that, but instead finished off an old half empty one w/ no results.  Heres my question....   Is there any danger of damaging my enamel with this expired product?  This is not an easy answer I know but i would appreciate it...    I used the unopened syringe and started seeing results around the edges and ridges of my molars, areas of pure white.... after only 3 hours so I think the unopened syringe may still have something left in it....   Of course I dont want to do permanent damage to my teeth because i am too lazy or cheap to buy a new whitening kit so, I took it out and came down to the computer for some answers.   Just wondering if anyone knew the dangers, if any.  Thank you. AuraOrthodontics: I'm an orthodontist and I've heard of this dilemma a million times from patients. Carbamide Peroxide actually expires after 2 1/2 years. After the expiration date it is less effective. If the product is no longer good you will notice that it turns a milky white. It shouldn't damage the enamel (orange juice is much more acidic), however if you notice extreme tooth or gum sensitivity, discontinue use and purchase a new whitening kit."

    "dialogue": "Klam1991: First of all I had visited a dentist office about getting Invisalign which they told me they can do it for a much lower price then what another office had quoted me.  (It turned out costing the same). I agreed and paid anyways and all my receipts says I'm paying $4500 for clear aligners and an expander.  5 months down the road the dentist office calls me and tells me I can't get clear aligners and I have to get braces.  Otherwise they'd have to charge me and additional $225 per aligner and I'd need 8.  I very reluctantly agreed to the braces because I had financed it and wouldn't be able to get the money I paid them back.  Is that legal? I thought this would be considered bait and switch.  Another question is the braces took 6 months to put on and take off.  Well they give me a retainer and never told me that I was going to pay for it and 7 months down the road I get a letter saying I owe $600 for that retainer.  Is it legal for them to charge me without informing me and I never signed anything to agree to pay for it either.  Is anything they are doing legal? AuraOrthodontics: I'd have to be present for the entire interaction to say confidently whether or not it's illegal. However, as an orthodontist, if there was no fine print that you signed in the very beginning or it's not listed anywhere visible at the orthodontist's office, I would say there's a good possibility that it's illegal. Perhaps discuss this with a lawyer, after talking with the orthodontist's office and explaining your concerns."

AuraOrthodontics: I'm an orthodontist and I've never had a patient where braces for 8 years. I would definitely get a second opinion. As for other options, Invisalign is great because you don't need rubber bands and you can take it out to eat, brush your teeth, etc. No bands are required. Also, have you looked into sublingual braces? This is where the actual brackets and ties are placed behind the teeth. If you're teeth haven't moved in 2 years, you definitely need to look into it with another orthodontist."

In transition we've been printing tray sheets with the patient's name and placing in arrival order. This is very wasteful since we only need the sheet to see the patient's name. \nI am curious as to how your office checks patients in and informs the assistant/hygiene staff. \nWe've tossed around ideas of a dry erase board with a patient's name.... listing names on a sheet of paper.... nothing that has been an amazing idea yet. \nThanks so much! FamilyOrthodontist: I know this post is a year old, yet no one had replied, especially with more and more orthodontists wanting to go paperless and thought I would chime in to help.\n\nA good solution is a using a tablet PC mounted at the front counter. There are a few ways to go about this. One is a paid program and the other is free or close to it. \nThe free one or the lowest cost option is that your office could setup a webpage on your website that patents could access via a tablet PC that is located at the front counter.\n\nThere the patient could enter their info and then have it sent to the front desk. It would be as simple as just typing your name and clicking the submit button. \n\nNot only is this a simple and clean process, you can also ask for info such as their email and cell number to use for paper free messaging and have them check a box to authorize this type of communication for further use.\n\nWith new technologies becoming available almost daily, paperless has been an easy transition for us here at  Family Orthodontics of Wellington, Florida and has actually help us connect better with our patients.\n\nBest of luck to you!"

    "title": "For a Fresh and Clean Mouth",
    "dialogue": "dentistfinder: Aside from the fresh and clean feeling, and being unafraid to smile at the world, there are other benefits associated with a well maintained mouth. It is not for nothing that an idiom was born about an ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure. And keeping your mouth clean is relatively easy, and cheap, for the most part. \n\nHere are a few tips to begin with: \n\nYour Toothbrush\n\n\nReplace your toothbrush every three months. After about three months, most brush bristles become frayed. This makes it less effective in cleaning your teeth. \nUse a sanitizer. Research shows that germs can remain and breed on wet toothbrushes. This can potentially prolong infections such as gum disease or sore throats. Choose from several brands available on the market. Most can kill almost 99 percent of germs.\nKeep toothbrush separated from others'. Airborne bacteria can move from other toothbrushes and from other sources in the bathroom can spread infections such as periodontal disease, common colds and flu. \n \nFloss and Mouth Wash \n\n\nUse floss and mouth wash daily. Just like you brush your teeth. Why use just one tool when there is a whole tool box? \nLearn proper flossing techniques. Improper flossing can damage your gums and leave food particles still stuck between your teeth. Proper flossing helps remove particles between teeth that brushing cannot remove. Check out this brushing and flossing animation from the American Dental Association.\nConsult your dentist on choosing the best mouthwash. There are two types of mouth wash; cosmetic and therapeutic. Cosmetic mouthwashes mask bad breath. While they can eliminate some bacteria, they only have a limited effect on dental health. Therapeutic mouthwashes help build tooth enamel and combat disease and cavities. \n \nBe Well Fluoridated\n\n\nFluoride is nature's cavity fighter. It is present in all water sources. According to the Surgeon General, “Fluoridation is the single most effective public health measure to prevent tooth decay and improve oral health over a lifetime, for both children and adults.”\nUse fluoride toothpaste. American Dental Association recommends that teeth should be brushed twice a day with toothpaste containing fluoride. Other fluoride products include mouth rinses, special gels and pastes applied in the dental office. \nDrink fluoridated water. Water from community or public water supplies contains fluoride. Bottled water does not. To ensure you are sufficiently fluoridated, it is best to drink filtered tap water, whenever tap water is safe for drinking. \nFor over half a century, the American Dental Association has continuously endorsed the fluoridation of community water supplies and the use of fluoride-containing products as safe and effective measures for preventing tooth decay. However, according to the Association website, recent news reports have raised questions about the safety of fluoride in drinking water. It is worthwhile watching for the latest developments in this area to ensure you are well informed. FamilyOrthodontist: Another tip is stay away from sugary drinks and smoking."

    "dialogue": "Jeff: Please help! Our son is 8 and has what I am guessing is an underbite. His lower teeth protrude in front of his upper teeth. When he chews, you can see his bottom jaw come forward of his upper. We took him to a pediatric dentist and she is recommending a face mask (I think it is called an extra-oral traction device?). She said he would need to wear it full time for 3-6 months. The other option she said would be a retainer, but she said it would most likely have little effect. She said if we do nothing, his teeth would continue to grind away, which could create other problems and he could also be faced with needing surgery when he is older. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with this? Is this action effective? Are there other options? He is 8 and the thought of having to wear the mask is horrifying to him. His first comment was, \"No one at my school wears that.\" We can do all we can to help his self-esteem, but kids can be pretty nasty sometimes.... Any input is greatly appreciated. \n\nThank you!"

    "dialogue": "bebalove0323: I had my braces removed after wearing them for more than 3 yrs. Right around the time when they were about to remove them, I noticed gaps, told them & was told that they will come together after a month of wearing my retainers. It’s now been 8 months and I only fear that it’s going to get worse. I'm no expert but I've tried my best to explain where they are...\n- gap (small black line) between Maxillary Central Incisors\n- gap (small black line) between Maxillary Central Incisor & Maxillary Lateral Incisor\n- Black triangular gap between Maxillary Lateral Incisor & Maxillary Canine\n- 1mm gap between both Maxillary Canine & Maxillary First Premolar\n- 1mm gap between Mandibular First Molar & Mandibular Second Molar\n(had IPR to have a band fit. Now I get a fowl stench & taste when I don’t remove food that gets lodged in) EWW! \nI know that these gaps may seem minor but it isn't to me. It wasn't only very expensive to get them done but it’s also been irritating my gums (where theres space) & it has made me more self-conscious then before I had any work done.\n***I also had 4 extractions due to crowding and an over-bite; I feel like they had better options (like using IPR) but they just took the fastest & easiest way out. I feel like it was their mistake and they should've calculated if that was going to be an issue. Now my ortho said that I need bondings and I need to pay it out of my pocket!!"

    "dialogue": "YaiiE: Hello everyone, my name's Jeremy i'm 26 living down in Florida.\n\nWhen I was around fifteen or so my dentist told me I had an under bite.  At the time I was to young for surgery and needed to wait for my jaw to finish developing.\n\nAs the years went on I didn't think much of it.  That's until my top teeth started to chip...  \n\nCome to find out my squeeky prepubescent voice, \"ass chin\" and constant chipping of my top teeth can all be attributed to my evil under bite.\n\nI knew the surgery was more expensive then I could ever afford so I went to my local dentist (down here in FL) to ask to have my top teeth repaired.  She told me she could use vaneers but wouldn't recommend it until my jaw surgery is complete.\n\nCan I do the vaneers anyway?  \"It'd be a waste of $600.  And I won't do it.\"\n\nI appreciate her honesty but at the same time my heart sank.  I just want to be confident when I smile...  Or even speak.  I swear when ever I talk to someone all they can ever do is stare at my teeth and it really wears on me.\n\nI want to know what my voice (should) have sounded like, what my chin should have looked like...  I want to be able to speak without looking at the ground or looking away to mask my chipped teeth.\n\nI'm stuck at a crossroads.  I have a 1 on 1 meeting with an Orthodontist on Monday but I fear bad news.  I'd bet money my insurance wont cover the surgery and the surgery itself will be well over $30,000.  \n\nDo I find a way to swing the surgery and spend the rest of my life in debt?  Or do I let it go...  And deal with this unnatural insecurity around people.\n\nI've read in some (rare) instances you can get a spot for a dentist in training or have the surgery in front of interns at little to no cost.  Is that something within reason?  I don't want to get my hopes up...  But something has to change!  \n\nI sat infront of the mirror this morning thinking what if I just sanded them down.. . So you couldn't see them at all!  An irrational, impulsive thought...  I just don't want to stand out for better or worse...  I just want to look normal."

    "title": "Types of teeth",
    "dialogue": "dentistfinder: Four basic types of human teeth make up the complete set of 32 adult permanent teeth. The following teeth can be found on each side of each jaw:\n\nTwo incisors \nOne cuspid or canine tooth\n02 premolars, also known as bicuspids\n03 molars \n\nEach type of tooth has a specialized function. Chisel-shaped incisors are used for cutting food while the canines with their single, prominent cusp are useful for stabbing and piercing food. Bicuspids, as their name indicates, have two cusps and one or two roots, making them suitable for chewing food. Molars are used for mastication—biting or grinding—of food to enable swallowing. Four or five cusps and multiple roots make them ideally suited for this role.\n\nPrimary or baby teeth are 20 in number and include only the incisors, canines and premolars. my smile: The four different types of human teeth are :\n\n1) INCISORS or Cutting teeth  \n2) PREMOLARS or Bicuspid teeth  \n3) CANINE teeth  \n4) MOLARS or Molar teeth"

    "dialogue": "allysonholley: I have always had sinus issues and recently the farmer we buy goat milk from told me that her orthodontist (who is retired now) said braces can correct behavioral issues (including ADHD) and sinus issues along with a lot of other things.  Said it was due  all the nerves that could be out of whack with an improper bite.  Ever heard anything like that?  The orthodontist I talked to in OKC disagreed."
