    "title": "Dental implant sinus lift surgery question",
    "dialogue": "Amy5757: I wanted to provide a brief history before my dental implant and sinus lift surgery:\n\nIn 2019, I had a root canal that failed, and I developed an infection. I went to an oral surgeon who removed the infection and bone graft material was inserted so that I could later have a dental implant. I was unable to pay the $5,000 (out of pocket) OOP cost at that time, so the dental implant was never placed. In September 2023, my general dentist advised me to get a dental implant. The dentist was unable to perform the surgery because a dental cone beam CT scan showed that I didn’t have enough bone height in the upper jaw for a dental implant so he recommended I go to an oral surgeon for a sinus lift and dental implant surgery. I was then referred me to an oral surgeon.\n\nHistory with Oral Surgeon:\n\nOn 11/20/2023, I went in for a sinus lift and dental implant surgery. I was prescribed Chlorhexidine, Ibuprofen, Dexamethasone, and Oxycodone. I experienced several complications, which I documented below:\n\n\n-After the surgery, I developed an extremely painful sinus infection. I had my second visit with the oral surgeon on 11/28/23. The scan showed I had a perforated membrane, and there was bone graft material in my sinus cavities. I was prescribed Amoxicillin-clav 875mg. and pseudoephedrine 30 mg tablet. The surgeon indicated that membrane perforation is a well-documented complication that occurs in a sinus lift surgery, but most of the time the membrane heals on its own without any intervention.\n\n\n-I had a 3rd visit with my surgeon on 12/7/23 due to significant pain in my right ear and the gum around the implant was throbbing. The surgeon prescribed Amoxicillin-clav 875mg, and more mouth rinse Chlorhexidine. I was on the amoxicillin for so long that I had diarrhea for several weeks.\n\n-I had a 4th visit with my surgeon on 12/15/23 because my symptoms had still not improved. I was prescribed more amoxicillin $2.57. The pain in my ear was so severe that he referred me to an ENT.\n\n*During each of my visits with the surgeon, he continually repeated that he’s never seen this happen before and doesn’t know of anything else he can do to help my situation.\n\n\nENT history:\n\nMy first visit with the ENT was on 12/18/23. The Physician’s Assistant (PA) said there was significant sinus inflammation and prescribed an oral steroid, Prednisone 20mg and a nasal spray, Azelastine. After a few days, there was minimal improvement, and I continued to endure severe ear pain due to developing eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD).\n\n-I went back to the ENT for a second visit on 1/2/24. The PA placed an ear tube in my right ear to help the middle ear drain and relieve pressure since I had ETD. I was also given a steroid injection in my ear, Triamcinolone acetone. I was prescribed oral eardrops, Neomyocin-polymyxine-hc ear solution and muscle relaxer, Tizanidine.\n\n-On 1/24/24, I went to the ENT for a 3rd visit where a CT scan of my sinuses was ordered. The PA also prescribed allergy medication, Cetirizine $11.95 to help reduce sinus inflammation caused by some seasonal allergies.\n\n\n-The CT scan was completed on 2/1/24.\n\n\n-I went back to ENT for a 4th visit on 2/20/24 to discuss CT results and I received another steroid injection, Triamcinolone acetone. CT scan showed mild hypertrophy of the right inferior turbinate and mild deviation of the nasal septum to the left with a bony spur indenting the left inferior turbinate.\n\n- I had this sinus lift surgery over 6 months ago, and I am still dealing with chronic sinus pressure that has been very difficult to relieve. Currently, I am still experiencing a constant itching, and tingling sensation around the dental implant. I was supposed to get a crown placed back in February but have been unable to because anytime I eat or move the implant, the itching and tingling sensation worsens.\n\n-I went to my general dentist on 4/25/24 to discuss my concerns. An x-ray was taken, and he was unable to find any signs of infection. He prescribed an antibiotic, Cephalexin 500mg. Unfortunately, the antibiotic did nothing to improve my symptoms.\n\n-I have never experienced any sinus issues in the past. However, after the implant surgery, I developed chronic sinusitis and ETD. I was in constant agonizing pain for almost 3 months and could not perform my normal activities and I missed weeks of work.\n\nBetween the office visits to the ENT and prescriptions, I’ve had to spend over $1,300 OOP. I have also spent hundreds of dollars outside of the office visits and prescriptions trying to relieve the sinus pressure. \nI'm not sure what to do from here. Has anyone ever seen this happen before?  Looking for advice. frankmurphy: Wow, I am really sorry to hear about all the complications you've been experiencing. It sounds incredibly frustrating and painful. While I'm not a medical professional, I can empathize with the toll this has taken on your daily life and finances. Have you considered seeking a second opinion from another oral surgeon or ENT specialist? Sometimes a fresh perspective can make a big difference. I hope you find relief soon. Hang in there!"

    "dialogue": "Floridaroofer: I was scheduled for full dental implants and told I was a perfect candidate.  I have 17 healthy teeth and 5 that need capped.  I could use a couple of moler implants.  But why pull so many good teeth ?  Is it for the 40k they want to charge. Dr M: Sounds like you need to get a 2nd opinion from another dentist. I would not recommend removing teeth, if other options have not been considered as well. desrosiersdental: If you have 22 healthy teeth, full dental implants might not be necessary. Implants are typically considered for replacing missing or severely damaged teeth. It's best to consult with a dental professional to assess your specific needs. Admire Dental Care can provide expert advice and personalized treatment options based on your dental health. blakey72: I've just had a full upper, I had 4 bad teeth left so I really needed it. I personally wouldn't get any teeth removed if they can be fixed. You want to keep your own teeth as long as you can, nothing else is ever as good. If you are willing to pay $40k on implants I'd be spending a lot less on fixing what is there. Even if you want to get a few single implants just do that. \n\nHaving the surgery is no walk in the park! It's long and painful. Then the days following my face is blown up like a balloon and bruised everywhere. Not to mention more pain than the surgery itself. I know everyone is different and some may fair better than me and some worse. Don't take this procedure as an easy fix to make yourself look better, it's a big surgery. I'd be looking at implants as a last resort. Only my opinion of course. Good luck with what you decide"

    "dialogue": "boloxchops: I had Molar # 2 removed 3 weeks ago (it was a root canal that went bad after 15 years). There was a sinus communication detected during extraction (large lesion and radicular cyst likely compromised sinus floor). Periodontist tried closing it. After stitches came out communication was felt again.\n\nFirst oral surgeon is talking about block bone graft and then Buccal Fat. ($5.5k procedure - won't work with insurance)\n\n2nd opinion said bone graft will likely fail and to just do Buccal Fat and Buccal flap to close it first, then consider bone graft later on if bone situation improves. ($1.1K procedure out of pocket).\n\nMoney not the issue. Doing the right thing is.\n\nThe boney defect is 10.97mm across.\n\nAny experienced oral surgeons have an opinion? Is the 2nd opinion more conservative or way too conservative? He said if bone graft doesn't take, because of the size of the defect, and the thin surrounding bone, I will have dead bone floating in there causing chronic infection.\n\nAttached is the CBCT image (2 angles) of the defect in the sinus floor.\n\nI appreciate any input. Just trying to make the best decision."

    "dialogue": "Eric2005: Recently the dentist told me that he can avoid a sinus lift by using short implants.  I had resisted the sinus lift as it seemed more than I could endure.  I have two missing molars.  The dentist seems convinced that a short implant is possible for one, possibly both molars.  I'm 72 years old, in generally good health.  Is this a good idea?

Pleases somebody can examine my ct picture? No painkillerrs working for this shooting pain.   Can somebody see something that area, or my pain is neurophatic?   If need more picture i can do it . Dr M: Can't see any root remnants on the CT or PAN, but it does seem that you have multiple other teeth with problems. Although it could be neuropathic pain, it might also be referred pain from one of the other teeth. I would suggest starting there. Sort them out and then see if the symptoms persists."

    "title": "How does it feel like getting dental implants?",
    "dialogue": "Dentist90: For those who got implants placed during oral surgery, how did that feel like? Did you feel a lot of pressure and drilling or it’s not that bad? I hear different stories. Two older women said it’s just a bit of drilling and pressure but you barely feel anything. Another one said it’s a lot of pressure. What was your experience like? Dr M: You will experience pressure for sure, although the amount of pressure is relative. The pain is also minimal, but again this differs from patient to patient due to their different pain levels. smithwilfer: Hi , my mother in law got implanted  few months ago. She had well adjusted to it. In beginning there was swelling and pain with sensation, but now she feels comfortable. flomodental: Getting dental implants at a Dental Clinic can be a breeze! They'll numb the area for comfort, so you'll mainly feel pressure during the procedure. Afterwards, expect soreness, swelling, and an adjustment period as your mouth gets used to its new smile. FLoMo Dental can help you manage discomfort and ensure smooth healing with their aftercare instructions. Remember, healing takes time, so follow their advice carefully to avoid problems. If you're anxious, talk to FLoMo Dental about sedation options! thomasrobert: When I underwent oral surgery for implants, I was quite anxious due to the varying stories I'd heard. In my case, the procedure involved some pressure and drilling, but it was manageable and not as intense as I feared. The discomfort was minimal, and the dental team ensured I was comfortable throughout. It's important to remember that everyone's experience can be different, but overall, oral surgery for implants was not as daunting as I had anticipated."

    "title": "UK Molar Extraction",
    "dialogue": "ChrisX: Hello, I live in  the UK. I just had a molar extracted by an NHS dentist.\n\nIn my area, these are quite rare these days. Most dentists do not offer much \"on the NHS\" so the choice is between waiting many months for a cheaper treatment on the NHS or paying far more for \"private treatment\".\n\nAnyway, I wanted to see if my experience is normal or not. This is my first extraction as an adult (I'm 64). Upper molar, the filling had dropped, somehoe I split the tooth and the filling fell out. One week later they took it out.  It cost £73.50.\n\nThe first injection was insufficient. When she started work and it was very painful, so she injected a lot more. That second injection also hurt a great deal.\nAfterwards my left eye felt strange and twitched and I found later that I could no longer flare my nostrils.\nI didn't know that was a thing I did, but when it went away it was very noticeable. These symptoms lasted a day. Is that normal?\n\nI don't know how they extract teeth, but there was a lot of repetitive sideways pressure and after maybe 20 cycles of the, the took came out, or rather broke off.\nHow do they do it - is it just pliers and brute force?\n\nWhat I was shown, was the part of the tooth above the gum line - no visible root at all.\n\nShe said I would need another appointment to get the root parts out \"somewhere that has the right equipment\". Is that normal?\n\nIt's the next day now, and the pain is beginning to subside. The blood clot is behaving itself.\n\nNow I'm dreading the next appointment. They will presumably have to cut open the guml have just healed, and put me back in pain, and after that experience, I'm really dreading it.\n\nMaybe it would be worth paying 4 times as much for that work privately?\n\nThanks for any thoughts you can offer.\nChris Dr M: It does sound like it was a difficult, but normal extraction. Sometimes it does take more than one injection to numb a tooth, and sometimes the effects can linger for 24 hours. The movements you explained, also sounds correct. Unfortunately, there is always a risk that the tooth can fracture during the extraction procedure. And if the practice doesn't have the right equipment to remove the roots, you unfortunately would have to go back for another visit, which might include surgical removal of the tooth roots MattKW: Not unexpected. We rarely get the chance to extract sound teeth, so fracture during extraction is quite common, esp if your tooth has already got a split.\nI teach extractions at my university, and getting students to understand it is quite hard - it really takes years of practice to develop the \"feel\". Having said that, the dentist should be prepared to follow through after a fracture with the appropriate technique. It's really not that hard to section an upper molar.\nI'd go somewhere else and spend the $."

    "title": "Hard, white gum after implant",
    "dialogue": "cabie000: I got my fifth dental implant done yesterday, and noticed something different this time: the gum surrounding the implant is hard and white. Not the entire gum, just the part immediately around the implant.\n\nIs this typical? Cause for concern? Dr M: It might be due to the implant crown exerting pressure on the gum tissue. This should resolve within a few hours. If it doesn't, you will have to go back to your dentist in order to relieve the crown. The white colour is due to the lack of blood supply to the immediate area. cabie000: Day 6 and the white color is question is no longer there, but I'm noticing this hard thing on my gum that's not going away. I've never experienced this before. Any ideas? Dr M: This looks fine. The area around the implant is still healing. The gum tissue forms scar tissue first, which is yellow-whiteish in colour. It will gradually transition into a normal pink colour. MattKW: That looks like a catgut suture, and will dissolve by itself."

I’m from the uk, I travelled to turkey with family and was really pushed by my relatives to have two of my teeth removed and get a implant, one front bottom teeth already fell out two years ago and one was on its way and another was infected, I was sooo devastated after because I felt rushed to it in taking that teeth out but I think it needed to come out and I also had my front bottom Molur removed because it was infected( I didn’t get implants for that one.\n\nI waited in turkey for two and half \nMonths and I got those implants with a bridge few days ago and I’m really disappointed, it’s not what I expected, they feel very stiff and like block of teeth rather seperate teeth, they look like dentures to me,  but I have zero experience with implants, I have gum disease, was told in the Uk implants might not be a option but I. Turkey they said there is enough bone to do it and that in the long term my Jew might go into self with out a bone there.\n\nPlz help and be gentle with me, I need to know I can get through this,\n\nI’m seeing the guy tomorrow and I need to go to him with a plan, I would get pressured from my family to just leave it as it is but I don’t like it Dr M: Okay, considering what you had to work with, this is not a bad outcome. Unfortunately I agree with the UK dentists. The fact that a tooth \"fell out\", tells me that you have periodontal disease. Dental implants is not recommended for people with periodontal disease, if the disease has not been treated and stabilized.\nThe reason why the bridge feels like a denture, is because they had to add pink porcelain to the bridge, to close gaps, since you did not have enough bone and therefore soft tissue to support implants.\nI would not have done implants in your case. This is why going to Turkey for alternative treatment options, sometimes ends badly, since you end up having compromised treatment. Yasmin: Hi thank you.\n\nIs there anything I could do now or should I keep those teeth’s.\n\nI know it’s probably not a good idea, but what could I put in my mouth, is what they are saying true about losing more bone in the mouth if I didn’t put anything in? Yasmin: What could treat my gum my disease do you think.\n\nI feel a bit sad the lost teeth and the one they took out.\n\nI’m going to share my x tray, he was saying the teeth needed to go Yasmin:  Yasmin: Can I just confirm they did put the screws in so was wondering why couldn’t he do normal implants. Dr M: The best option would be to see a periodontist in your case, since your periodontal disease needs to be managed first. It is true that implants keep bone in the area, like normal teeth do, but it is irrelevant if you have active periodontal disease, which will leads to bone loss anyways. Start with a periodontist. He can manage the gum disease and give you an opinion on the implants as well. Marian Mejia 2”A”: I think so, but it has to look aesthetic and natural, otherwise it will look fake and that's not good."

    "title": "Extraction or root canal? Got different opinions from Endodontist and oral surgeon with dentist opinion. Do I need to extract #47? Second lower molar.",
    "dialogue": "Stackflow: My tooth gum on second lower molar is painful. Went to dentist and took X-rays. He said x-rays are normal. But gum was so painful when he probed and touched or rubbed those gums.\nI have bad breath in the mouth all the time. Even after brushing and using moth rinses. I feel bad taste and smell in the mouth.\n What does it mean to have bad breath and bad taste in the mouth ?\n\nIts painful on the distal side of the tooth. And around the gum margin on that tooth. Tapping and pressing that tooth doesn't hurt.\n\nBut touching and pressing the gum hurts. It hurts so much in the gum and throbbing like burning pain.\n\nI have yellow hard tartar buildup only on that molar and rest teeth are fine. Have been scheduled for cleaning. Dentist probed that gum and it was so painful and I was screaming with pain.  \n\nHe sent me to Endodontist and oral surgeon referral. Endo said to try root canal and see if my gum pain gets better. Just like a trial root canal. He said it might or might not help me.  \n\nThe oral surgeon told me to better extract it as I have extracted the first molar because of same type pain issue. So he said I can better remove this also to see if my symptoms gets better. Been struggling with this pain for more than 3 years. Have chronic jaw pain. I do use a night guard and didn't help much. \n\nNo dental work done on 47 except several occlusion grinding adjustments has been done on it as Dr suspect my misaligned bite could be reason for jaw.Did several adjustments and ended up having uneven bite now.\n\nI didn't have any finding on 46 but it was painful for tapping,biting etc.So they did root canal &followed by several retreatments&nothing helped. Did extract # 46, 9 months ago and still have pain in that gum.\nHad several cbct& came out normal.\n\nDo I need to do root canal or extraction on 47? \nOne dentist in reddit forum told me that I have some root stumps left on #48 region.  \nI asked about root stumps left on my#48 socket area and my surgeon said he don't see anything like that. Do I need to get second opinion on this? I have severe pain on distal side of 47 gums. \n\nIs extracting 47 a good idea? Brause: I was in a similar situation with first molar 46.\n\nRCT did not work at all...it did nothing for pain. Tooth was subsequently extracted.\n\nA friend of mine had 47 (or 37) extracted and lived happily thereafter without implant...as it is so far back.\n\nHaving the same issue with tooth 36 right now...and will not go for endodontic treatment. Unless there is caries (which does not apply here), the bacteria pathway must be some kind of fracture...in wich case a RCT will be unsuccessful.\n\n\"Trying a RCT\"...is an expensive experiment. Even if it worked initially, the patient is sitting on a time bomb as a RCT does not last forever. flomodental: It's understandable that you're confused with differing opinions on your #47 tooth. Here's some info to help you decide:\nUnderstanding the Options:\n\nRoot Canal: This procedure removes infected pulp, cleans the canals, and seals the tooth to preserve it. Endodontists typically perform root canals.\nExtraction: This involves surgically removing the entire tooth, including the roots. Oral surgeons often handle complex extractions.\nWhy the Difference in Opinions?\nBoth specialists likely have valid reasons for their recommendations. Here are some factors they might consider:\n\nSeverity of Infection: An endodontist might favor saving the tooth if the infection is treatable with a root canal.\nTooth Structure: An oral surgeon might recommend extraction if the tooth has severe cracks, fractures, or extensive root damage.\nRestorability: If the remaining tooth structure is insufficient for a proper crown after a root canal, extraction might be preferable.\nNext Steps:\n\nDiscuss the Reasons: Talk to your dentist about the rationale behind each specialist's recommendation. Understanding their reasoning will help you make an informed decision.\nX-rays and Medical History: Review your X-rays with your dentist to see the extent of damage and discuss any relevant medical history that might influence the choice.\nConsider Your Preferences: Think about your comfort level with procedures, recovery time, and budget. Root canals are generally less invasive than extractions. Implants are an option to replace extracted teeth, but they usually cost more.\nAdditional Tips:\n\nIf you're still unsure, consider getting a consultation with another endodontist or oral surgeon for a second opinion.\nDon't delay treatment. Leaving an infected tooth untreated can lead to further complications.\nFinding the Right Dental Professional:\nFor both root canal therapy and oral surgery consultations, you can consider a general dentist practice like FloMo Dental. We can examine your tooth, review your X-rays, and provide a referral to a qualified endodontist or oral surgeon within our network based on your specific needs.\nRemember: I cannot give medical advice. The best course of action is to discuss these options with your dentist and the specialists involved to determine the best course of treatment for your specific situation."

But teeth, with one root, usually can be extracted easily without serious risk to the adjacent teeth, if done by a proper dentist. lola1: In case I use a bridge to cover my right lateral incisor tooth which is broken, I would like to know if I extract the root of this broken tooth the bridge will last longer.\n\nIn particular I would like to know if the bridge will be inserted in the hole left by the extraction of this tooth and as a consequence there is less risk that the bridge will fall. Dr M: You will have to extracted the root. You never leave a root behind below a bridge, because it can lead to future failure of the bridge. lola1: I read that after the extraction of the root we have to wait several months before putting a bridge to wait that it heals and its shape to stabilize.\n\nIt is inconvenient to have to wait so long before having a bridge and there is also the possible complication due to the extraction of the tooth\n\nHence, I would like to know if the nerve in the root has been removed and the part of the root which sticks out is removed by the dentist if we can put a bridge without extracting the root.\n\nMoreover, I read that the hole in the gum left by the extraction is only temporary and as a consequence it will not be possible to insert part of the bridge in it to make it last longer. Dr M: You have to remove the entire root. Your body sees it as a foreign body and even if you only begin with removing the top portion that sticks out through the gum, the other portion will also come out eventually. Your body pushes it out.\nWhen removing the root piece, you have some bone loss in the area. That is why we usually recommend waiting 3 months at least before starting a bridge."

It took over an hour (the temperary filling indicates the non-completion of endodontic treatment). If bruxism can cause trauma that leads to microcracks, pulpitis, and eventually to periapcial abscesses, why should biting on hard rubber while having to absorb these shock waves not have the same effect?

We've done a socket preservation and the site has healed. I'm about 6 months post-extraction at the time of writing. \n\nThe bone has resorbed and there is a horizontal defect. The bone width is between 2 and 3.5 mm at best. Vertically it's fine, with no defect.\n\nIdeally, I'd want to have a post-immediate implant with GBR and gum graft in one session. The other alternative is to have the GBR, let it heal for 3-4 months then place the implant.\n\nI have 4 treatment plans so far, 3 from London and one from Budapest from a world-renowned doctor who invented the Sausage Technique \n\nLondon 1 said he would try to do a one-step procedure, with GBR, implant, and gum graft but it would depend on what he sees during surgery and if the odds are not favorable he would opt for the delayed solution. It would take around 3-4 hours plus sedation.\n\nLondon 2 said he could do the implant with his eyes closed (he rectified after and said of course it's involved and so on) with a 97% success chance, 1:15 hours, with xenograft material and no sedation but with no gum graft. He said a graft would be hard to maintain, and high odds of failure so there's no reason for it. This would be the most convenient option for me but I'm concerned about the long-term durability of such an implant and the soft tissue architecture therefore I'd like to get your thoughts on this. He did say there will some some recession.\n\nLondon 3 said there is no way he can even attempt a one-step surgery and he would do a block graft followed by the other steps. Under no way I'm going to have a block graft in this day and age for that area so it's out of the question however he did raise some good points about London 2's option with a one-step procedure and the xenograft. He was concerned about the success odds, the durability of the implant, and the risk of my bone fracturing during the procedure because of the narrow width.\n\nBudapest said 2 steps, first GBR, then the implant. However, it would be virtually impossible for me to travel 4-6 times and stay 7-14 days on some occasions.\n\nI have at least 2 other opinions lined up for next week from some reputable doctors in London but it seems there's more consensus for a 2 step procedure vs a single-step procedure. For me, it would be ideal if I could get it done in one procedure because it's been a long process and I'd like to finalize it but I have to weigh in the success rate, the long-term survival rate, and the most predictable strategy backed with data not just convenience.\n\nI will update the thread once I get the other opinions but any thoughts that can help me make a more informed decision would be appreciated.\n\nMany thanks.\n\nTudor."

Dr M: A dry socket is a self limiting disease, meaning eventually it will heal on its own. The antibiotics you are taking for the strep, should also assist with any infection. Try taking any anti-inflammatory OTC medicine. If the pain is not better in two days, seek a second opinion from another dentist.

    "title": "Sinus perforated 3 months ago,  not healed.",
    "dialogue": "ALGAL: I had 2 rear upper molars surgically removed over 3 months ago. One of my molar's roots punctured my sinus wall.  My surgeon said at the time it was approx 4 mm opening. It has now been over 3 months and I do not have closure on the opening.  It feels almost as big as day 1 post op. My oral surgeon wants me to continue to wait for spontaneous healing, which of course I do as well, to avoid another surgery, however the opening is very stressful to me as it continually wants to fill with food particles and liquid & and risks  infection in the area.  It feels like there is a large pocket up in the area above the hole in my gum and I feel like I need to try to keep it cleaned out somehow but do not want to upset any healing. Should x-rays be taken? Is it  practical & safe to continue to wait for spontaneous healing? \n\nThank you very much for any insight,  and/or advice. Dr M: 3 months is a long time to wait. I don't know why the surgeon advised you to wait, since usually only 2mm openings and smaller spontaneously heal. A 4mm opening should usually be addressed as soon as possible, preferably on the same day the opening was intially caused. I would suggest seeking a second opinion from another oral surgeon. They will most likely suggest rinsing out the sinus, to clean out any debris, and then close the hole with a surgical flap. Don't wait any longer. ALGAL: Thank you so very much for your reply and advice!  My surgeon advised me immediately after the surgery that this perforation had occurred and that he placed stitches in it.  Also sent me home with instructions how to protect the area,  such as sneezing with mouth open, very gentle nose blowing,  no straws,  etc.  On day 4 post op, suddenly I felt something had just happened,  then had nasal bleeding and pain kicked in.  Upon seeing him the following day & explaining this he seemed bewildered,  just said we would wait now and watch it,  never mentioned that I maybe had lost the blood clot and now had dry socket. So I powered thru it during all this time,  seeing him a cpl times re infection concerns,  etc.  My current surgeon has many many years of experience & great credentials so I am very disappointed to be finding myself in this situation. Is this a difficult surgery to perform properly? And is it a difficult recovery for the patient? \n\nI have read extensively about my situation and everything concurs exactly as you have advised. Only 2 sources (one I believe was NCBI) says to wait 3 to 4 months before referring for surgery.  That is the only reason I have held out hope.\n\nAgain,  thank you so very much for your time, concern and advice.  It is very well taken. Dr M: Usually the surgery is not too difficult to perform, and the recovery time afterwards is not too long either. It might be a bit more complicated since some time has lapsed, compared to performing the closure at the time of the sinus opening. ALGAL: Thank you.  Ideally, should my oral surgeon have closed it back up immediately (or soon thereafter) when on day 5 post op I told him something changed and that I now had bleeding & pain?  He never mentioned that there was any reason for concern, and I didn't know that I had lost the clot & maybe was having dry socket pain. I do have appt for 2nd opinion next week."

My understanding is that supervision is good enough so that the quality of work usually quite good. But reading some reviews online (mostly on Yelp)  of the clinics in and around Boston (I'm in w.

Not about the work itself, but just a lot of complaints about lots of very long appointments and feeling not too well cared for--and it'll also be a 2 hour drive for me just to get there. Still, there are a few very good reviews--but honestly, the majority are bad and most of the clinics have an average of 2 stars. How legit and realistic do you think this is? Maybe it's just the people who've had a bad time who go to the trouble to write the reviews, and those who've found it ok don't bother? I'm fine going wherever I need to to be able to afford it, but if it's just a bad experience...that would be not so fun. Thanks for any thoughts or advice!\n\np.s.

Was wondering whether the dentist failed to remove it completely or it is some bone fragments, or maybe an infection as it is painful.  Also, the gum at the side of the socket looks horrific as it has split open.  Shouldn't the dentist put stitches in or will it heal itself?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThe first two photos was taken two days after the extraction and the last is day three. alakuni: The white stuff you're seeing could be connected with the recuperating system, for example, tissue or bone parts, which may ultimately determine as your body recuperates. Notwithstanding, it's crucial to discuss your interests with your dental specialist or oral specialist to guarantee everything is advancing true to form.\n\nGum harm can likewise be troubling. Recall that legitimate post-employable consideration and following your dental specialist's proposals for oral cleanliness and wound administration are essential for a smoother recuperation. Assuming you notice any uncommon or diligent issues, contact your dental expert for direction and consolation.\n\nYou're in good company to confront these difficulties, and your dental group is there to help you during your recuperating venture.

    "dialogue": "Kris44: I have had an extraction of a front lateral incisor tooth and a placement of a bone graft by a surgeon. Extraction was uneventful. The pain started 2 days later above the extraction site and adjacent tooth.  I then got nerve pain up the nose to forehead, sinus pains and pain to ears and painful lymph nodes. Antibiotics for 12 days made all better, but the pain returned. Surgeon did not want to give more antibiotics, although he did agree that most likely bacteria most likely irritate the nerve. He said my body will take care of it. It does not do so after 2 months. I asked for a removal of graft. He told me there is nothing wrong with graft, he will not remove it. Two Months later I still  have nerve pain, my face is now numb above mid lip. Something is very wrong. I did bring up to the surgeon that maybe mouth bacteria got between graft and socket, or perhaps I was one of the unlucky people not tolerating this particular donor graft. The dentist told me, he cannot do any more for me, and he released me with the pain and the problem. There is no swelling above the extraction, but I assume, I do not tolerate this graft.\n I think I want the graft removed, but how difficult is this? I see no value to turn to neurologist for lifelong pain treatment.\n Does anyone have any input? MattKW: There was no indication for antibiotic Rx after the extraction. The fact that it made things better would be largely coincidental.\nBone graft is not a source of pain. Never heard of this before, and no biological reason why it should.\nWould suggest you see neurologist or a pain clinic for proper assessment of your signs and symptoms. Ask surgeon for referral so he can include your records.\nKeep us updated back here! Kris44: Thank you for taking time and giving me your thoughtful reply, Matt.  I hear you.\n\nSince other people may read this post, I like to add this for anyone being ever in the same situation.\nOn the topic of antibiotics, sometimes antibiotics are indicated, particularly when people are at risk for osteonecrosis or osteomyelitis. I belong in that category. Since my own surgeon agreed, he thinks in my case bacteria are irritating the facial nerve, I think my raising this point is appropriate. I think, and the surgeon thinks, antibiotics are not to be summarily dismissed. I happen to not be able to take Doxycycline which this surgeon offered to prescribe, so I did not get a prescription. On the topic of bone grafts. 6% of bone grafts fail, I guess for non- compatibility reasons. After all, they are transplants when from cadaver. This information is widely available. Most bone grafts from cadavers I believe are pretreated with antibiotics, so I guess, it only happens very rarely that they contain bacteria, but it does happen.\nHas anyone had a problem with a bone graft."

John Morgens: I understand that you are feeling scared and anxious about the prospect of having multiple teeth removed and getting dental implants. It is completely normal to feel this way, especially if you have never had any surgeries or IVs before. Here are some suggestions that may help alleviate your fears and make the process more manageable:\n\nCommunicate with your dentist: It is important to have open and honest communication with your dentist or oral surgeon about your fears and anxieties. Let them know about your concerns and ask any questions you may have. They can address your fears, provide reassurance, and discuss the steps they will take to ensure your comfort during the procedure.\nConsider sedation options: If you are particularly anxious, your dentist may offer sedation or anti-anxiety treatments to help you relax during the dental implant procedure. This can help alleviate your fears and make the experience more comfortable for you.\nPlan ahead: Start planning for dental implants even before your tooth extraction. Let your dentist know that you are interested in replacing your missing teeth with implants as soon as possible. They can discuss treatment options with you and may even perform socket preservation during the extraction to expedite the implant process.\nEducate yourself: Take the time to learn more about the dental implant procedure, including the steps involved and the expected recovery process. Understanding the process can help alleviate some of your fears and give you a sense of control.\nSeek support: If you are feeling overwhelmed, consider seeking support from friends, family, or even support groups for individuals going through similar dental procedures. Talking to others who have been through similar experiences can provide comfort and reassurance.\nRemember, dental implant surgery is a common and routine procedure performed by experienced professionals. With proper communication, planning, and support, you can overcome your fears and achieve a healthy and functional smile.If you want to get more information you can visit mylifesmiles one of the best dental clinic .

DariaMerritt00: Help with implant and removal of teeth involves dental procedures related to tooth replacement and extraction. Implants are used to replace missing teeth by surgically inserting a metal post into the jawbone and attaching an artificial tooth. Teeth removal, on the other hand, involves extracting damaged or problematic teeth. Dentists and oral surgeons provide these services to restore oral health, improve aesthetics, and alleviate pain or discomfort. These procedures are essential for maintaining dental function and appearance."

    "dialogue": "beantownace: Hello.  Hoping I can get some feedback on this. I had a tooth extracted based on an infection that was a good size dark spot near the tooth they ended up extracting that had a crack in the root of a previous years ago root canaled tooth.  I could not see the fracture but the oral surgeon said it many times is a hairline crack that allows bacteria in.  I am 13 days out from the extraction was on amoxicillin for 8 full days twice a day the site is healing well it seems but I am now seeing the same pus spot come up again and that is concerning me as that was the purpose of removing and cleaning out the infection.  Any advice?  Tx all  Posted pic as well of extraction area and pus spot. John Morgens: I can offer some general information based on your description. If you're concerned about possible infection after a tooth extraction, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider for accurate advice and diagnosis.\n\nIn some cases, even after a tooth extraction and antibiotic treatment, there might be lingering infection or complications. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n\nPost-Extraction Healing: It's normal for the extraction site to have some degree of pus-like discharge (known as exudate) during the initial stages of healing. However, if you're noticing persistent or worsening pus, it could be a sign of ongoing infection.\nIncomplete Removal: If the infection was not fully removed during the extraction process, there's a possibility that some infected tissue or bacteria might remain, leading to the recurrence of pus and infection.\nResistant Bacteria: Sometimes, the bacteria causing the infection might be resistant to the antibiotics prescribed. This could result in the infection not being fully eradicated.\nReinfection: If proper oral hygiene practices are not maintained, reinfection can occur. Bacteria from the mouth can enter the healing site and cause complications.\nForeign Object Reaction: Occasionally, a small piece of debris or foreign material might remain in the extraction site, causing irritation and discharge.\nDelayed Healing: Some individuals experience delayed healing, which might lead to prolonged discharge. This could be due to factors such as medical conditions, immune response, or the body's healing process.\nGiven the recurrence of pus and your concerns, it's important to reach out to your oral surgeon or dentist. They can examine the area, possibly perform tests, and provide appropriate guidance based on your specific situation. They might recommend further treatment, antibiotic adjustments, or additional cleaning of the area if necessary.\n\nRemember, only a qualified healthcare professional can provide accurate assessment and guidance. If you have any worries about ongoing infection or complications, it's best to seek professional advice to ensure proper healing and prevent any further issues. MattKW: That is most likely to be due to a residual bone chip following the extraction - over time most of these little bits work to the surface and fall out. In rare cases maybe a bit of tooth remains.\nYou can go back to the dentist and he takes an Xray. Dead bone chip will look like live bone chip (so won't show up and therefore assumed), so would then numb you up and clean out the wound with a curette; simple. If it's a bit of tooth, it would show up on Xray but would also curette it out easily."

I’ve never had a tooth pulled and this was not a pleasant experience. I was told to just take ibuprofen so I’m in a lot of pain. But what I’m concerned about is it looks like a piece of jaw is attached to the tooth. The tooth is giant the biggest tooth I’ve ever seen lol. Is this my jaw attached to the tooth? If so will it grow back is this something to be concerned over? Even the dental assistant was like what is this weird bone growth on the tooth and the dentist just shrugged it off. I didn’t give it much thought at the time, mainly because I was in shock. Also he didn’t stitch the hole or anything and I don’t know I’m just kind of freaking out a little because I’ve never had a tooth pulled and I’m just in pain and now just worrying myself. MattKW: Pain relief: best to take a combination or paracetamol and ibuprofen for first few days, and then taper down as it improves (see attached).\nThat looks like an upper 2nd molar? It's common for such teeth to come out with a bit of the weak surrounding bone; nothing to be concerned about in your case.\nMolars do leave a big hole, but they heal up well in young people. Initial healing of a thin layer of skin occurs within 2 weeks; for the socket to completely heal up and the bone to reshape takes 3 months.\nStitches don't often do much for closing the hole for a single extraction. I would be placing stitches for 2 or more teeth taken out at the same time, mostly to help bring post-op bleeding under faster control. gabbymessenger1497: Thank you for the reassurance. It was my upper left wisdom tooth. I think they called it number 16. I’m 26 and it’s been completely grown in for years now it had room to come all the way down. But I couldn’t reach it very well when brushing so it started to decay so that’s why I went ahead and just had it pulled bc I didn’t want it to start effecting the tooth next to it or worse it becoming infected and getting an abscess or something.

The extraction socket seems in good shape and healing but I am noticing a white patch on the gum in between the tooth in front of where the extraction was done and they also did a bone graft.  This seems new I did not notice that before.  I am on antibiotics as well but that looks odd to me and it is whiter than the photo attached here shows.  Anything to be concerned about? MattKW: Soggy semi-keratinised tissue. I suspect you haven't been brushing too often in this area recently, so you have built up a soft skin layer (keratin) that will brush away and is of no significance. John Morgens: After a tooth extraction and bone graft, it is normal to see white material or tissue hanging down from the extraction site. This white material is usually granulation tissue, which is a normal part of the body's healing process. Granulation tissue is composed of blood vessels, collagen, and white blood cells, giving it a white color. It serves to protect the site until new gum tissue or bone can form.Sometimes, surgical gauze may also be visible in the socket, which will also be white in color. As long as it is not causing any discomfort, it is best to leave it alone as the body will eliminate it on its own.However, if you are experiencing severe pain along with the white material, it could be a sign of a complication such as an infection or dry socket. In such cases, it is important to contact your dentist for further evaluation and appropriate treatment."

A dentist thinks it can be done as early as July - says there is advanced technology to make this possible.  I'm confused. MattKW: Wait till Ocotober for a more assured result. You don't want to take any risks just to save a bit of time. Eric2005: I thought implants could be done the same day as extractions, no? Dr M: You had additional bone grafting done. Sometimes the oral surgeon needs to make sure that the procedure was successful before placing the implant. Follow the advice of your oral surgeon."

The next day, the tightness is gone, and everything was fine. However, on the 3rd day evening time, I experienced some pain whenever I'm eating. It's not that painful but noticeable. I tried using my finger to press down in the implant crown but it doesn't hurt that way but it does hurts a little whenever I chew food with it.\n\nI currently have a temporary filling on for this implant crown, the dentist will fill it with composite filling on my next visit if everything is okay with the crown.\n\nAnyone ever experience the same thing? Not sure what's going on. Dr M: It might be that the implant crown is too high. I suggest making an earlier appointment with your dentist to check the occlusion on the crown. Any excessive forces around an implant, might result in bone loss TeaMatcha: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIt might be that the implant crown is too high.

One part of the fractured bone was leaning to the upside; it was not in its natural position. 2 days later I underwent an operation to fix a titanium plate to keep the bones in place so as to help bone healing. Now my swelling is totally gone and I am able to chew slightly and can speak normally, even though I cannot stress my jaw even a bit more while speaking or eating. 2 days ago I heard my jaw making creaking sounds, these sounds came from the fractured part and it came every now and then. These creaking noises had happened once earlier too, just a few days after the operation; the dental surgeon said that its normal and that I should wait for that to heal.\n\nAre those noises a cause for concern?

Despite the results, I still get a white build up that bleeds slightly when I brush it. On top of that, my angular cheilitis just healed.\n\n(I should add that I was never clinically diagnosed by my dentist or oral surgeon. I’m just confused why my tongue keeps bleeding.) MattKW: What type or brand of test did you use? When it says \"positive\", was there a measurement reading, i.e. CFU mL?\nWhy haven't you been to a dentist or oral biologist (or even your usual doctor)?\nDo you have photos? Jawbreaker001: Neither my GP nor my dentist thought it was oral thrush upon first impression, but my dentist swabbed my tongue to be sure.\n\nI don’t recall the test my he used. I just know that he used an oversized q-tip and liberally swabbed my tongue. A few days later, he told me the sample was negative for oral candidiasis.\n\nHowever, sometimes my tongue bleeds when I brush, and I read that typically bleeding is caused by not a fungal infection.\n\nI’ve included 3 photos below for reference:\n\n1. Typical presentation when I wake up in the morning.\n2. The worst bleeding I’ve had after brushing/scraping my tongue — usually it’s only 1/2 taste buds bleeding.\n3. My tongue after a cleaning (no issues with bleeding). MattKW: This is not a Candida infection, it's a typical non-harmful \"hairy tongue\" caused by long filiform papillae. There is no need to brush your tongue so aggressively to wear them down. \nEveryone has Candida in their mouth, so just getting a positive reading means nothing without a quantitative measurement, and there is always going to be an underlying problem of either immunosuppresion or overuse of antibiotics. A Candida infection will typically peel off with finger rubbing."

I have done very simple extractions that have really upset people, and then I have done some really tough surgical extractions that some people didn't get concerned about.

Presumably the gum was torn there during the extraction.\n\nIt’s now more than two months since the extraction and the hole still looks a long way from being closed and the area is still tender.\n\nI’m pretty concerned, as the info I’ve read online suggests the extraction site should have closed within one month.

MattKW: There is no need for further mouthwash or other treatment. I don't understand what you are trying to remedy or what you expect the utlimate outcome to be. You have bone damage that has healed up OK. Because you no longer have a tooth there, any hard food you eat will bump the soft gum and be a bit annoying; that's what happens whatever tooth you have removed, and most people adapt to it.

It lacks the strength of regular gum and would tear easier than regular gum would. So, from my perspective – although it has a skin layer of sorts – the gum in the area hasn’t fully healed.\n\nThe salt water/Corsodyl is to hopefully aid further healing and stave off infection (as I say, the area has started to feel a little sore/achy/stiff) and the salt water/Corsodyl seems to relieve that, which again suggests to me that it isn’t fully healed. MattKW: For people I've extracted teeth from in my 40+ years and 15,000+ extractions, that is in the range of normal healing  and requires no further treatment. Please try to stop worrying about it."

    "dialogue": "meenu: Hello! I'm a 33-year-old male, located in the US, non-drinker, non-smoker.\n\nI've been having some pain chewing with my 2nd lower right molar (tooth 31). My dentist thinks that it can be root canal'ed, I went to a second dentist who thought that root canal has a poor prognosis and recommended extraction + implant, and I went to an oral surgeon who thought that I could go either way, and also gave me the option of extraction + bone graft only, or extraction + bone graft + implant in the same session (he said that my tooth looks like it's amenable to doing the implant in the same session).\n\nI like my oral surgeon (he also did my wisdom teeth last year and did a great job), but with so many options, I'm honestly confused on what to do here. I've heard that extracting a 2nd molar without replacement is usually fine for chewing, but risks the upper 2nd molar erupting, and I don't want to lose so many teeth (especially with the 2nd molar on the left side also having some issues that will probably need RCT/extraction down the road - it's just got a filling on it for now).\n\nI'm also not sure if doing an implant in the same session is a good idea - my oral surgeon said I could wait 4 months and come back for the implant if I wanted to take a wait-and-see approach to see if I really want to replace the tooth, and I'm also wondering if doing the implant in the same session has a worse prognosis than waiting for more bone to grow back after the extraction? Or, it doesn't matter, and I should consider myself lucky that I can do it in one session instead of multiple like most situations?\n\nLastly - I'm quite anxious when it comes to dental work, so I've asked for valium for the extraction (+implant) since he only wants to do local anesthesia. It'll be my first extraction while awake (he did my wisdom teeth with IV sedation), so I'm a little nervous about how this extraction would go? He said he'll do a \"surgical extraction\" that takes ~30 minutes (implant an additional 20 min), which sounds rather... scary.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts. Thank you all so much!\n\nX-ray attached is from Feb 2023. MattKW: Whilst an RCT is technically feasible, the real issue is the final \"restorability\" of the tooth. The RCT access hole will come in from the top of the tooth; add to this the large hole in the back of the tooth (which will be a bugger to fix), and you will be left with a structurally very weak tooth. Even planning a crown at the end will not improve your long term chances -  I'd give the tooth a 5 year life after you've spent a fair amount of money. So, I'd go for extraction.\nA surgical extraction for that??? What tosh! The extraction will be dead easy - the tooth is upright, there's quite enough to get a good grip, and it has nice conical (ice-cream cone) roots. A competent dentist would have the extraction done within a couple of minutes. I would suggest just simple local anaesthetic, maybe some \"Happy Gas\" if available, or at most a smallish dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine (triazolam is great, temazepam is good, diazepam (\"Valium\") is good but lasts much longer). If taking an oral benzo, you need someone to transport you. Certainly don't need IV.\nAfter such a simple extraction, I would wait 6 months for bone to heal, and to see if you feel you need to replace it. If you then decided to go ahead with the implant, I doubt you'd need bone grafting - this should reshape nicely and leave sufficient bone for an implant.\nThe opposing upper would become redundant if you don't place an implant, but waiting a mere 6 months won't cause significant over-eruption. meenu: Thank you so much for your advice!! MattKW: Good-o! Let me know how it goes.\nIf you are in the US, then talk to oral surgeon or dentist about taking triazolam. It is marketed under the name \"Halcion\" and comes as 0.125mg tabs. See Wiki for a bit more info.\nThe best way is to plan the extraction first thing in the morning. Take 1 tab the night before to help you relax and get to sleep. In the morning, have a light breakfast and have someone drive you to the dentist, arriving at least 30mins early and take 1 tab 30mins before the appointment in the reception area.\nIf you don't have some food in your tummy before a stressful situation, you are more likely to get even more anxious and faint. I always carried fruit juice in my fridge to give to patients who hadn't eaten before an extraction."

    "dialogue": "danc2050: Hi. I am looking for a dentist who will give me an elective lingual frenectomy. I do NOT have a tongue-tie, but I feel that my mouth will benefit from the extra reach from this operation (able to clean with my tongue more efficiently, for example).\n\nI live in Vancouver, WA and would prefer a provider in WA or OR, but can also fly to other places. I am able to pay out of pocket as I don't believe my insurance would cover it if I do not have a tongue-tie (though it does cover oral surgeries).\n\nAnyways, please contact me here if you are a provider or know of one who would do this. I'm not looking for a consult either  -- I just would like to get the work done. Preferably with a laser as I hear that it can open the frenulum more effectively.\n\nThank you!\nDaniel MattKW: Given that there are risks associated with frenectomies (attached), you will need a better reason to satisfy a dentist. No-one will just do it without a consultation and discussion of your expected outcomes (why are you doing this), and the expected benefits (will it achieve what you think it will), and the risks."

Need 2 chipped teeth capped and 1 previously capped tooth root canaled. After my exam I started taking better care of my teeth and flossed a lot more. On my lower right side between my back molars and cheek a felt a hard, painless dome shaped bump under my gum. The bump is about the diameter of a small pinky end of the finger. It seems to be pointed toward the front of my mouth and not to the side. In this general area I had a wisdom tooth yanked several years ago. I’m a 49 white male. There is no pain, no headaches, no fever, no problems chewing, no discoloration on the gum, not noticeable from the outside and no sinus issues. (Although I did in the last year have sinus issues caused by cpap that were exaggerated by afrin addiction. I have in the last 3 months detoxed, changed my cpap habits and gave no sinus congestion at all for 3 months). Fast forward to today and I went in and had 1 cap put in. The dentist did a pano X-ray and is referring me to oral surgery pathologist for further scans. I’m freaking out because I have high anxiety which I am on meds for. I am a tooth grinder. I get routine bloodwork done every 3-6 months at my PCM and they have all come back normal for years. Any advice, support or information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. MattKW: Have you considered it might be a torus? You can Google\"for images of \"buccal mandibular torus\"or go here - I have tori that look like those in the 3rd photo. They're benign, altho catch a bit of annoying food like muesli sometimes. I've only ever referred 2 patients off for removal, and that was because the patients were going to get dentures. ninety5eclipz: Matt, thanks. I guess it can’t be ruled out but I cannot see anything in my mouth that looks like any of the pictures. There is nothing visible as it it tucked way down in the back corner under soft tissue. Poking around is the only way to feel it. I guess I’ll just have to wait to see what comes up on the scans. MattKW: Let us know the results, and I'd be interested to see the scan.

About 10 years ago after I got out of the military I went to a civilian dentist. He asked me if I had ever been shot on the face with a BB gun. He said there was something in there that was not biological but to just leave it unless it starts to cause problems. I completely forgot about this until recently. The upper one between the 2 teeth is actually a filling. The lower one is not. I think it was something that was left in there when I had 2 wisdom teeth (1 on each lower side) removed just before I retired from the military. Is this something of concern I should have removed? It causes no pain or issues. Just a bump. MattKW: Of no concern."

I regret it though , because they suspect that tooth is the reason for my jaw pain.\n\nMy jaw pain is in the mandible end lower jaw near the ear where the lower jaw line ends. I have this for 3 years now.\nI went to my dentist when this started. He took an pan xray and said everything fine.\n\nThen he tapped on all teeth on this side. Tooth 30 was painful for tapping. Kind of  very sensitive and I just shrink my eyes.  And he gave tooth stick to bite on and it was sensitive too.\n\nSo he said I might have some issues on 30. I didn't go in with tooth pain at all. And I was eating on it totally fine until that visit.\n\nI went to dentist after seeing an ENT for this pain. ENT did nasal endoscopy and said no issues. So went to dentist to check jaw.\n\nBut he spotted this tooth 30 issue. Took CBCT scan and nothing found. He said I can see Endodontist. Went to Endo the following week . This is all before 3 years. Then Endo did cold test and tooth was alive. But sensitive for tapping and biting pressure. So he said he will do exploratory root canal and see inside.\n\nDid it and nothing found and no relief.  Same symptoms. I have severe jaw pain near the jaw end. But my bad, since the root canal, tooth 30 started hurting which wasn't hurting before that.  It was hurting only for tapping and biting before that RCT.\n\nThen had another cbct scan. Nothing seen. The Endo forced me to get crown immediately to see if it helps. Spent thousands of dollars on it and got perm crown the following month. No relief and pain was so much on that molar. It's like pressure on it always and hurts to even touch.\n\nChanged the Endo and saw new Endo. Took another cbct scan. Nothing seen. He said I can try retreat root canal.\n\nSo did retreat root canal on it and no changes. My bad , nothing helped. He retreated again in 2 months. And retreated again in 6 months. So 3 retreats tried till 2022.\n\nNo relief and taken another cbct.  Nothing seen.\n\nBut it was so painful in the gums and tooth area.  It was also hurting in 31 gums. It was so much painful in 31 gums and I used to scream when they probe those gums.  But periodontist said gums ok. But I screamed in his dental chair when he probed it but he dismissed me.\n\n\nEnded up pulling 30 in July 2022 and my bad, I still have all symptoms just minus the tooth. I have pain in tooth socket gum area. And severe pain in 31 gums.\n\nI went back to surgeon several times since pain in the jaw where mandible ends. Same spot.  Pain just came back once anesthesia wears off. So called them the next day and same jaw pain. So surgeon said it could be dry socket and poked my socket and removed the stitches. No food debris or nothing in it. It was healing well \n\nHe put clove paste and asked me to come on day 5 and day 7 after ext. Digged again and put clove paste.  No changes at all. My pain was the same. Taken several rounds of antibiotics.\n\nI still have pain. I saw him till October and he dismissed me saying xray looks ok.\n\nI have severe pain in tooth 31 gums now.  It hurts for touching, brushing and probing just makes me scream and jump out of dental chair.\n\nI extracted this tooth only because it was painful for touching tapping and biting pressure.\n\nMy dentist and Endodontist did another treatment called occlusion adjustments and they grinded all my teeth as they thought occlusion issue could be reason for jaw pain. They grinded all my teeth and bite is totally off. I can't eat anything solid now. I can't eat anything at all on right side.\n\nOn the left side, after these bite adjustments, I couldn't eat anything solid and totally on soft diet for 3 years. \nMy bite is off and not meeting together and touching down even. \n\nI have also seen TMJ specialist, ENT, neurologist for this. Taken MRI and CT of jaw and neck as well.  Attaching x-rays before and after root canal and extraction.  Few more images In comment.\n\nDo you see anything wrong on my jaw, tooth 30 and tooth 31.  Now I have severe pain in 31 and I went to dentist and Endodontist for this.  No answers. Don't want to end up pulling that too.  Any issues seen on 31? Severe gum pain. Stackflow: More xrays MattKW: I suggest you find a Pain Clinic attached to a major teaching hospital. There is no point pursuing it from a strictly dental point of view.

There is no point pursuing it from a strictly dental point of view.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nOk Dr.  I did see a pain management clinic and pain management specialist tried different nerve medicines on me in the last 2 years. I saw him in 2021.  He said he is more focused on my symptoms control rather than finding the root cause or diagnosis. \nI have tried amitriptyline gabapentin Cymbalta Lyrica and currently taking tegretol. He said if it's nerve pain , I should get some relief with these medications. \n\nI have seen orofacial pain specialist TMJ specialist and they said it's like Myofascial syndrome and tried many muscle relaxers and physical therapy. I did more than an year of physical therapy and dry needling.nothing helped.  \n\nNow they said my bite is off and could be causing pain. I am arguing that my bite was fine when this started and it got changed only after those bite grinding adjustments and the crown on 30. \n\nBecause my dentist did lots of adjustments on 30 crown when it was placed and adjusted other molars and other teeth so many times.  He took tooth 30 out of occlusion by purpose and tried that if it helps with pain.  Since it didn't help, Then he adjusted all other teeth to it's  height.  \n\nI still have same pain in the lower jaw  line and constant since day 1 for 3 years now.  Now I have severe pain In gums of tooth 31. Do you see any issues on #31? I have severe throbbing pain in that gum. It hurts for touching brushing etc.  Looks inflamed.  \n\nI recently saw an TMJ specialist and he reviewed my MRI and cbct scan. My MRI report says normal discs but I have got different opinions on my MRI. One oral surgeon said it's anterior displacement without reduction. Other surgeon said normal. Another tmj specialist whom I saw recently said my condyles are positioned different than normal.  And that could be the reason for pain.  \n\nMy cbct scan report shows condyles laterally positioned and I asked the tmj specialist who ordered the scan.  He said that could be my normal anatomy and dismissed me to see chiropractor. He wanted me to see chiropractor and get neck adjustments.  I have pain in the side of the neck on the right side and back /base of neck. So he said chiropractor adjustments required. \n\nI am very scared to go to chiropractor because of their adjustments and didn't go yet.  Just avoiding going there.  \n\nRight now, I am still with dental issues @MattKW. Issues in my 31 tooth as gum pain is severe, bite issues because of  occlusion adjustments and this tongue herpes thing which I have. Constant primary pain is in the lower jaw where mandible ends. I even checked about eagles syndrome with ENT.   \n\nI also have high inflammation CRP blood work since 2021.  So seeing rheumatologist for that. My CRP is high since then.  He is testing me every 3 months and the recent CRP blood work was high too.  Don't know why it's still high.\n\nWhether condyles or disc issues cause these type of pain for so long ? And affect tooth and gums? I feel like I did an unnecessary extraction of #30. That was so painful and throbbing to touch tap and pressure.  But nothing seen on xrays and cbct scans.  Ended up pulling it. \n\nI don't want to end up pulling 31 too.  Don't know why that gum is so painful.  My Endodontist said I have occlusion trauma on that tooth as my dentist adjusted 30 so much and took out of occlusion 3 years ago and 31 has to take all pressure.  That was the only tooth touches if I bite down.  So he adjusted it again in November. \n\nSince then the tooth is so sharp and still bite feels uneven.  I am scared to get more adjustments because my old dentist (I even changed my dentist because of this) did several bite adjustments visit and I saw him for 8 weeks for this grinding on all teeth in 2021.  \n\nI feel it's not done correctly and made a mess of bite issues.  I can't chew down on anything. And can't even bite on fries.  No solid foods.  Feel like I can't exert enough force to bite on those.  \n\nI feel bad for myself and this mess. Don't know what should be the next step.  I moved to a new city and have to find new dentist and other specialists.  So searching for a new dentist and oral surgeon to check this from square one.  Everytime I feel I am progressing but after every appointment I feel like I am back to square one.  \nNo diagnosis and relief. \n\nDo you see any issues on my condyles or discs @MattKW doctor? MattKW: Are you serious? A TMJ specialist suggested you see a chiropractor. How would neck adjustments help with an area served by cranial nerves? I think you're having a go of me. End of conversation. Stackflow: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAre you serious? A TMJ specialist suggested you see a chiropractor. How would neck adjustments help with an area served by cranial nerves?

He said he had lots of patients who had issues in the cranial discs c1 and c2 and had my similar symptoms sir.  \n\nSO he recommended upper cervical chiro.

Has anyone on here done this, or can anyone suggest a good type of cement for this job?\n\nI'm in the UK and have an NHS dentist - they won't fix it because the NHS doesn't touch implants. MattKW: Doesn't make a lot of sense. They are either screw-in or cemented, not both. Any X-rays to show us? Any details about the brand and model of implant? PWB: Thanks for getting back to me. Implant went in 2017; documents just call it an implant, but I have attached an  xray which  shows the left central incisor. The \"therapeutic relationship\" with the dental surgeon broke down; the owner of the practice, a GDP in UK terms (a primary care dental doctor), straightened the tooth - I thought she cemented it, but she may have just used some kind of tool, I just can't remember. If this is a screw, which when screwed in fully is now crooked, could I screw it  to a straight position and cement it there? If so, what type of cement would be good for this job? MattKW: Can't help you much more; you'd really have to find someone local.What I can see is that you don't have much in the back teeth to chew on, your lower front teeth are severely attritioned, and your upper front tooth is a long crown. This all means that you are putting a lot of unnatural chewing forces on the front tooth which is at a mechanical disadvantage due to the shearing forces. You should really get upper and lower partial dentures to move the chewing forces to the back teeth where they belong. Otherwise I envisage that front crown will keep coming off. PWB: Thanks for your comments on the x-ray. That's the only one I've got and it dates back to 2017. I've got a plate in the lower mouth; NHS treats the attrition with fillings, and I wear a mouth guard at night. \n\nThe gap on the upper right has now been closed with a long bridge - the previously mentioned dental surgeon put in an implant, which failed - he had to dig it out of the sinus cavity. There is a successful implant closing some of the gap on the upper left. The crown on the right central incisor came off a number of times so I have that on a plate now. \n\nMy question was about a do-it-myself repair on the left central incisor. I take it that you don't consider it safe for a patient to do that."

    "title": "Wisdom tooth extraction",
    "dialogue": "David35: Can anyone give me some advice on wisdom tooth extraction. What happens to the area were the tooth roots where? Dr M: What exactly do you mean?\nIn very basic terms,the socket in general firstly fills up with blood, that co-coagulates to form a blood clot. This clot, gradually transitions into scar tissue and then into woven bone, which is immature bone. The woven bone gradually mineralizes and becomes normal bone David35: Thank you that explains it fully thanks. Would It be possible to get your opinion on my wisdom tooth. MattKW: Put up an OPG. Quality needs to be at least 350kB, or better 500kB.\nWhat is your age? How many are being removed? David35: Any chance of sending it privately I don't really want to put on a public forum. MattKW: Sorry, no. David35: I will post the xrays. The wisdom tooth grow in at an angle and caused decay in the 2nd molar. This was filled 10 years ago. When I was 25. I kind of think the wisdom tooth should of been removed then when I was younger. I'm now 35. David35: And it's just one bottom left I don't have upper wisdom tooth and the lower right one is erupted normally David35: That's the x-ray from a month ago. David35: And that's the area from 2019. I have had the filling since around 2012/13. I'm not sure why wasn't removed when caused the original decay. MattKW: Yes, it should've been removed well before the decay started; this was an inevitable result. It will be a surgical extraction requiring lifting up of the gum, then severing the tooth in 2 planes - first light green to remove the crown part, and then possibly dark green to divide the roots. For a competent general dentist, that is quite achievable; for an oral surgeon it'll be easy.\nThere are a few risks, as with any procedure:\n\nthe filling in the 2nd molar may be damaged and need repair at another appointment. My first step before raising the gum would be to slice off the back edge of that lumpy amalgam (yellow line) to minimise this issue, and make the extraction easier.\nThe red lines show a major nerve bundle (the IAN) under the root tips. There's always a risk of damaging it, particularly if there has to be any digging around deep in the socket to chase broken roots. I see it as really unlikely.\nIf a root tip DID break during the extraction, it is reasonable to sometimes leave it in place and let the bone heal over.\nThere is another nerve just on the inner side of the wisdom tooth - the lingual nerve. Again, very small risk of damage in your case in hands of competent dentist.\nThen there's the usual issues - pain, bleeding, bruising, possible \"dry socket\".\nI'm guessing you're in early 30s? The bone where the wisdom tooth comes up will fill in with new bone over several months. Because this extraction has been delayed, the bone at the back of the filled tooth (blue arrows) will NOT fill up. You will have to work extra hard to keep the back surface of that clean for the rest of your life. David35: Thanks previous dentists have never mentioned removal not sure why. Thought it has already caused damage. I should still be definitely looking at getting it done?  Thanks for such a detailed response MattKW: Yes, still get out ASAP. And any other potentially damaging or redundant wisdom teeth. You don't want to develop problems in your 70s, 80s, or 90s when you might be in Aged Care, plus have other medical conditions to juggle. David35: Thanks again. The filling was done 10 years ago now. I have only this last week started flossing in the area between the wisdom tooth and the second molar and alot of food gets stuck in there that the floss seems to get out. I'm happy to get it done but I'm in no pain at the moment with it or ever have, but am worried about it. Is it going to be better for my oral health with removal? As said earlier I wish I was advised to get it removed 10 years ago before it lead to the filling. That is the only filling I have in my mouth. Thanks for any more advice and all the advice you have given in the first message with the diagram. David35: Would it be generally agreed removal would be best? I really don't want to lose the useful tooth in front (second molar) David35: I occasionally get a creaking sound which I think is maybe coming from the filling when chewing this is not all the time but does it from time to time. David35: Sorry, one dentist said yes to taking it out another said it's borderline so I am unsure. What causes the bone loss if it has caused it?  They said the bone loss looked pretty stable between the x-ray from 4 years ago. MattKW: I've given you free advice and you're not taking it. You have to make up your own mind now. End. David35: Sorry, I'm just worried about it. I really do appreciate the advice. David35: I am going to get it removed. I am  scared if I leave it cause more problems having already caused the filling."

Or I may just leave a gap if I can get used to it, but I'd like to keep the option of an implant open.\n\nI’ve seen a specialist who feels I’m likely to be a good candidate for an implant; a CBCT scan shows there is ‘extensive external root resorption affecting both the palatal aspect of the crown and most of the palatal root’ of the cracked first molar, but apparently this isn’t in the more central area where an implant would be placed.\n\nIn case they’re of use…\n\nA CBCT image of the area: https://photos.app.goo.gl/66pfKEmQrWLmVKFx9\n\nAn OPG x-ray: https://photos.app.goo.gl/2EFikk5wexSMc9Ho6\n\nI’ve been offered the option of a graft in the socket at the time of extraction. The specialist says this may help preserve the bone and gum volume, making me slightly less likely to require a bone graft if I decide to get an implant (still thinking about that). And also that I may have a slightly better final aesthetic outcome due to less tissue shrinkage. The graft would be with Bio-Oss (artificial bone made from bovine/cattle bone, which apparently is widely used). He's made clear, however, that I'd need a CBCT scan a few months after the extraction to assess the amount of bone, and that there's no guarantee that a graft done with the extraction would save me from getting a graft later.\n\nI wonder if any dentists could share whether they’ve found a bone graft at the time of extraction (called a ‘socket preservation’ graft I think) to be of value and provide better outcomes?\n\nI’m happy to pay the money if it is worth it, but the benefits seem a bit vague, plus I’ve found some seemingly reputable sources online that suggest maybe it’s not such a good idea.

    "title": "Single wisdom tooth extraction - and pushy NHS referral",
    "dialogue": "dms84: About 6 weeks ago a lost a chunk of my upper right wisdom tooth. It cracked a few years ago and my dentist did their best to repair it but always expected it to go again. They attempted to repair it again but after drilling away all the decay there wasn't much of the top of the tooth left. They applied what they described as as a \"temporary dressing\" and took an xray to decide whether to refer me to a specialist for extraction. The dentist told me it may be a difficult extraction due to the roots and there may be complications with my sinuses.\n\nNext I know is I get a rather pushy letter from a dental surgeon offering to extract the tooth for free on the NHS (not sure how UK-focused this forum is so realise not everyone will be able to help with the NHS bit). I say pushy because the letter says that normal NHS referrals can take up to a year but they can see me in 2 weeks and it's completely free of charge. I can't help but find this a bit suspicious because why doesn't the NHS refer more people their way if they 're so quiet?\n\nSo general dental question is whether extraction is the best/only option? I've had absolutely no trouble with it in the last 6 weeks and do I need to subject myself to the potentially difficult extraction and risk of sinus implications? I don't mind paying more money if there's a better option available.\n\nAnd UK-specific question is whether there's anything dodgy going on with this referral? I always like a bargain but I'm not short of money. I'd rather pay a private dentist myself if it will result in a better result. It occurred to me that maybe they use trainees or something? Or perhaps they just think it's an easy job but might not end well if things get complicated.\n\nMany thanks in advance for any help with either of the above questions. MattKW: Most upper wisdom teeth are surprisingly quite easy, and the risk of sinus complications small. But some dentists don't like to do them because it is hard to see what you're doing - it is largely by feel. If you have an Xray or two, put them up and I'll be more sure.\n\nIt is very rare that I advise people keep their wisdom teeth. Usually they are hard to clean, and patients either get decay or infections.\nIt's easier to remove a fairly intact wisdom than a rotted one.\nEven worse is that plaque buildup between the wisdom and the next molar in front will cause decay in the adjacent tooth - now you have 2 damaged teeth, and maybe 2 extractions. \nIn the attached image this has occurred to both upper and lower 2nd molar teeth next to the wisdoms (yellow arrows). So, both wisdoms have to be removed PLUS the lower 2nd molar; the upper 2nd molar can be filled but it's going to be very difficult."

Now the dentist couldn't actually take the full tooth out and instead she had to break the crown by splitting it apart and she's referred me to a oral surgeon because she couldn't remove the root of the tooth but she still charged me for half the job? I currently am awaiting to be seen in 2 days time by the oral surgeon but would only be a consultation as I'm not registered with them as it was a referral. I have quoted how much for the tooth extraction will be from him and the receptionist said it all depends on how difficult the tooth is and could cost upto £400, now I have a couple of questions which I am going to share with this dentist before any procedures happen. 1. Can an xray show if the teeth are going to be difficult? As the dentist I saw previously struggled and literally said after that she's never seen teeth like mine before....I'm not very confident with that statement to be honest. 2. Let's say the tooth extraction for only the root will cost \"0\" if the full tooth was there and the dentist previously didn't touch it would the extraction again still be \"0\"? Obviously the price wouldn't be 0 I'm just using for example.  Because I don't feel comfortable being charged for half the job really. Final question, where I've been referred as an urgent case although it's been 3 weeks already and thankfully not been in pain or anything, can the oral surgeon maybe repair the tooth instead of removing it? Any advice would be appreciated. Dr M: Do you have any x-rays you can share? MattKW: Everything is 20/20 with hindsight. I have extracted ~15,000 teeth over my 40 years (prob average for a general dentist) and now I teach students how to extract. It is very difficult to teach/learn because despite assessing all likely factors - age, root shape, tooth integrity, ease of access, etc there will always be some surprises. \nIf I assess it will be horrendous, then I will refer the case to an OS for removal under general anaesthetic. Even so, I have also had to stop during a couple of planned surgical extractions and admit defeat, tidy up the wound, and refer. \nIn such cases I haven't charged the patient, but legally I would be entitled. As long as it wasn't a foolhardy attempt, e.g. didn't take pre-op Xrays, then it's simply bad luck, and they have done the right thing to relieve you of pain and to refer.\nI can't imagine that the OS would be able to repair the tooth.

How does one eat when their whole mouth is an open wound, basically?\nI'm not getting the interim dentures. \nThanks! Dr M: You will have to stick to soft foods initially. There is a high chance that food might get stuck in some of the sockets, leading to possible dry-sockets, but if you follow the post-op instructions, you should be fine. The pressure from the interim dentures, usually helps to stop the bleeding, so based on the amount of extractions that is being done, there might be some prolonged bleeding.\nOther than that, follow all the instructions given to you by the treating dentist/surgeon. MattKW: Have soft foods ready in the fridge - soups, noodles, pasta...\nMake sure you are sutured up - it surprises me that some dentists don't always do this.\nHave someone to be with you at home or available to call for at least the first 4 days. \nGet an after-hours tel number from the dentist. They should have a schedule to ring you the following day and thereafter.\nThe best painkillers nowadays are combination acetominophen and ibuprofen, e.g. \"Nuromol\", \"Maxigesic\". I will rarely give an extra  'script for an opiate, but only to be taken at night if necessary. Take a dose of \"Nuromol\" just before surgery, then take it every 6 hrs for the next 2 days, even if you are feeling better. Then change down to acetominophen if possible. NEVER exceed 4000mg (8 tabs) of acetominophen per day.\nExpect bruising. To minimise, have some cold packs ready at home or make your own with ice-cubes in a plastic bag. Always wrap in a cloth (face-washer) and apply for 20mins on, then 20mins off for 1st 24 hrs.\nDry sockets (DS) do not occur because the blood clot is dislodged by food or swishing - long disproven. The risk factors are: extractions of lower teeth, smoking, difficult extractions, contraceptive pill. If DS occurs, it will come on about 3-4 days post-op and be unresponsive to painkillers. The dentist should contact you at about this time to check in.\nSalt water is all very well as a mild antiseptic, but a 0.2% hlohexidine mouthwash, e.g. \"Savacol\" is much, much better. Start it 2 days before the extractions (twice daily) and keep up until you go back for a review (1 week?).\nIf you are well sutured, then bleeding shouldn't be a problem. For high risk (of bleeding) patients, a tranexamic acid mouthwash might be prescribed. A compounding pharmacist can make it up, or I just give patients the tabs with DIY instructions.\nGood luck helps a bit too!"

    "title": "Third molar extraction complication",
    "dialogue": "nicholasl91: Hello everyone . I had my left lower third molar extracted in April 2022. I had a complication where Parts of my jaw bone broke snapped leaving sharps protrusion on the ridge below preventing the gum from healing. As a note the dentist that extracted the tooth wants nothing to do with recovery as it was an emergency referal ( this is unfortunately how it works in the UK at the moment due to a broken dentistry system) so I went  to a separate private dentist. He tried to smoothen the bone but did not solve the problem and instead ended up removing bone and creating a bit of a trench slightly behind the area where the pain was occuring and was then a bit nervous to do any more smoothening due to concerns of hitting a nerve.  Whilst the area he smoothened has since healed and is causing me minimum discomfort I have had chronic pain on my ridge for 8+ months now which is significantly interfering with my daily life. The gum is very thin and unable to heal properly and on touch the ridge is very pointy and sharp. The dentist who tried to help me seems to think I should just learn to live with the pain which seems a bit ridiculous and very depressing prognosis to me. Having reviewed the few pieces of literature available on this topic which appears to be a rare complication called lingual bone dehiscence I believe it should be possible to address the problem by simply smoothening the ridge but in the correct location and by an experienced oral surgeon. On another matter I still have a feeling of trama in the extraction point and surrounding teeth and there are bones sticking out the gum in the extraction site which based on literature is not normal 8+ months after surgery. The gum above the site is also constantly sore. I'm not sure if this is due to me having a bone spicule still trapped inside or my upper molar also being impacted. I will try and upload a picture of the site below. I'm seeing a face surgeon next month for an initial consultation  which I'm praying will have some positive options but there are incredibly long waiting times now in the UK before national health service operations can be carried out so I am thinking of consulting with a different private dentist to see if they can resolve the problem sooner. Given the big cost of private dentists I was hoping\n somebody had any thoughts on the issue and whether this is something  a good dentist firm should be able to help with and that I've just been unlucky. I will try and post a current picture of the site below. Regards NL nicholasl91:  MattKW: Firstly, tooth numbering: the wisdom tooth was the 38, and the one in front is the 37 (FDI).\n\nI doubt that you have pointy bones sticking thru the gums, that looks more like scar tissue from your photo. Similarly, if there was any spicule remaining, it would have either come to the surface by now, or created a small infection. \nTrying to smooth the bone where you have arrowed is a strong risk for lingual nerve damage, and it would be useful to have notes that describe how he went about this issue. I doubt that the nerve has been badly damaged, or you would have a numb tongue on that side.\nThere is also a nerve in the area  distally where you have labelled \"chronic sore gum\", the long buccal nerve. Again, how the operation was performed and the types of incisions may explain your problems. \nThere is also the risk that the 37 was damaged either by the 38 before the extraction, or during the extraction.\nI would ask the treating dentist for records of the extraction, including any Xrays, so that you can take them to the OS for review. nicholasl91: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFirstly, tooth numbering: the wisdom tooth was the 38, and the one in front is the 37 (FDI).\n\nI doubt that you have pointy bones sticking thru the gums, that looks more like scar tissue from your photo.

Your advice is incredibly appreciated. Under point 1 it is hard to get a camera at the correct angle but I can literally pick at the bone with a finger. It's hidden behind 37.  I hope with Your point 2 that the bone pointing to the ridge does also not present the same nerve ridge. Thanks Again"

    "title": "Impacted Canine - Exposure - Chain",
    "dialogue": "cw/braces: Hello everybody,\n\nI have an impacted canine and I fitted clear fixed braces in July 2021. \n\nAfter creating space between teeth with a coil spring, I had surgery to expose my palatally impacted canine in June 2022. It was a closed exposure with bonding of a chain for orthodontic traction. \n\nOn June 10th 2022, I had an online video call and consultation with the surgeon and we talked about the closed exposure and the gold chain. This was my first surgery in life ever. To me it was quite a big deal as I work with my voice, and I told this and made it clear to the surgeon who said I was in ‘good hands’. \n\nThe day of the surgery I was asked to sign an electronic  consent form at the clinic, but in the consent form there was written ‘extraction’. I made sure to tell them, and that I wrote next to my signature the word ‘exposure’ before signing. The surgeon also told me not to worry as we discussed about the exposure and that was going to happen. \n\nThe surgery happened, it went well, and I went back home.\n\nAfter a couple of days I started checking my palate and the stitches, and I noticed that the chain didn’t have any loops and it was wrapped around the arch wire with composite. So I started to get suspicious as it didn’t look like the gold chains that always appear online if you just google ‘braces traction chain’. \n\nI went to my next orthodontic appointment on July 7th and as soon as my orthodontist saw me she started to tense saying that there was something wrong with the chain. She went to reception to call the surgeon (I could see her from the cameras in the room that she was quite agitated). She came back after several minutes. She didn’t say much about the chain, just that it was not the right one as it didn’t have any loops and it was difficult for her to tie it and use the traction force as she had never worked with a chain like that before for the traction of the canine. She also said about the chance of having another surgery to replace the chain, but in the meantime she managed to do something using an elastic power chain and she wrapped the chain with composite around the arch wire where I have a coil spring to keep the space open for the canine (picture attached as a reference) and I went home.\n\nNobody told me anything about what was wrong with the chain, but after some online research I found out by myself that what the surgeon attached to my impacted canine during the closed exposure surgery was a retainer. Yes, a fixed retainer wire. I asked the orthodontist and she confirmed. \n\nIn the meantime my orthodontist was no longer available until the end of August due to her being on holiday and I had to have an emergency appointment with the principal dentist who wrapped again the chain around the arch wire as the composite worn down. I started to complain about the situation because I wanted to know more about what happened, but the principal dentist said that as soon as the orthodontist would be back they would have had a meeting with herself, the surgeon and the orthodontist. \n\nSummer went by for me with a huge sense of injustice.\n\nEnd of August I received an email by them saying they had a joint meeting with all staff involved, and would like to offer me a face to face meeting with the surgeon to discuss this with me in person.\n\nDuring my in-person meeting at the beginning of September the surgeon told me that (below there’s an extract from an email they sent me with the summary of the meeting we had):\n“As we discussed, prior to the day of your surgery, I was aware that your procedure was for an “expose and bond”, and this was all checked on the morning of your surgical procedure also. However, due to a miscommunication between myself and the nurse, I had assumed that the gold chain was in the box that he had showed me. As this is a common procedure that I perform in a hospital setting, I had assumed that the same equipment would be available. However, once the tooth was exposed, the nurse handed me an orthodontic wire that I had incorrectly assumed was the material the practice uses, and it was only when I spoke to your Orthodontist after your appointment with her that I realised that this was not the case.”\n\nHe told me in person that it was also due to the fact that the clinic didn’t have an ‘exposure’ option to tick in their booking system, and they only had ‘extraction’ so the nurse probably didn’t know what was needed for the ‘exposure’. And thanks to this, they have made sure that now in the system there is an ‘exposure’ option with all the details. So it’s basically nobody’s fault?! But I am left with the suffering.\n\nOn January 18th 2023 I will have an OPG to see the position of the canine at the moment - I feel it moved but I need the confirmation from the OPG. My question to you all is: with all your knowledge/experience would you advise me to have the second surgery so they change the chain and the traction could go faster? And if so, would you advise an open or closed exposure at this point? Or would you advise me to wait? Has something similar ever happened to anybody?\n\nI am not very keen on having a second surgery as I feel it was quite traumatic for me what happened and also the fact that I work with my voice makes everything since the surgery and the wrong chain quite challenging, plus I will have to take some downtime again. I am currently wearing also two buttons on the inside part of the left upper arch as one tooth started shifting due to the power chain she applied - the retainer chain with the composite is continuously rubbing against my inner lip and it hurts as being a fixed retainer is not supposed to be bent/wrapped. \n\nSorry for publishing this as anonymous (cw/braces) but I am still very sensitive and suffering about this, as I kept it quite until today with everyone. This situation is kind of taking a tool on me, weakening me both from a mental and physical viewpoint as I feel a huge sense of injustice and I don't know how to solve this in the best way possible by myself. The only positive thing from this is that hopefully what happened to me won’t happen to anybody else at that clinic.\n\nThank you so much for reading and for your time in advance, I hope I explained everything right. \n\nC x MattKW: Unfortunately, you'll have to do the surgery again. I've never seen a wire used for extrusion. Ideally, the surgeon should've checked the referral from the ortho or rung the ortho rather than blaming it on his nurse if he was unsure. Rather than you talk directly to the surgeon, politely ask the ortho if they would talk to him about redoing it at no fee. I think the ortho will apply the correct pressure to the OS as the OS could otherwise lose further referrals from the ortho, and word spreads easily. I've changed surgeons and endodontists for my patients when they didn't treat my patients properly. The referrals are like an extension of my own treatment."

Every time I brush and floss there, I notice that there are residues of food, but even after cleaning the pungent smell remains.\nI have made several visits and received mixed opinions.\nBasically, there are those who have told me that the included wisdom teeth are decayed, while others have not seen anything; only one person has told me that they are decayed and a cyst is also present near one of them.\n\nYou can well understand that I find it difficult to entrust myself to someone without knowing if there is actually a cyst, or if reaches some conclusions only thanks to my indications, which sounds decidedly not reassuring.\nCan anyone give me some confirmation?\n\nAlso I would kindly need another clarification: with the extraction I have been told that there is a risk of damaging the nerve and losing sensation in the jaw and lip. Are there any ways or technologies to avoid this risk?\n\nI fully understand that it is not easy to make an accurate analysis from here.

    "title": "Infection while on antibiotics after extraction?",
    "dialogue": "Joee: TL;DR: Was on antibiotics for a couple weeks (at least) before extraction and continue them after extraction. Is it normal to have a flare up of infection symptoms while on the antibiotics right after the tooth is removed? First day after extraction was better, second day after extraction has swollen gums and lymph nodes. My be normal? More detail below.\n\nI had the last molar on the bottom right before the wisdom tooth removed Thursday. It was infected for probably a month (probably longer) before it was finally extracted and I was on antibiotics for the last 2 weeks of that time right before the extraction. They went ahead and extracted it because the antibiotics just weren't taking the infection away. Dr said he could see infection coming out as he was extracting.\n\nI'm now on a new round of Amoxicillin 500mg 4x day. Today is the second day after the extraction (not counting the day it was extracted). On the first day after extraction, I felt a lot better, with the lymph nodes calming down and the pain going away and just not feeling sick from infection. Today, day 2 after extraction,, my gums are now very swollen and tender around the extraction site and my lymph nodes are pretty sore and swollen. It's pretty apparent that there is infection there, probably left over.\n\nSo my question is, does it sound normal to have an improvement like I did on the first day after extraction, and then a flair up of pain and infection symptoms the very next day, even though I'm on antibiotics and had taken them for a while before the tooth was even extracted, or is something wrong? I had kind of figured that since I had the antibiotics built up in my system, once the source of the infection was removed (that poor tooth), the remaining infection would just kind of fizzle out. This seems more like an actual active infection that's being fought and coming to a head and such. Dr M: Do you have any x-rays or such to give us an idea of how large the infection was prior to extraction? How are the rest of your teeth looking? Could be something else entirely contributing to the infection not clearing up. Did you consider that maybe you have a dry socket, which is common 3-5 days after an extraction? Joee: Unfortunately I don't have the x-rays/didn't see them but for second. I do believe it was rather infected though. I'm day 4 post extraction and it's still very sore, but there are signs that the infection is starting to go away. I think it was just a very big infection and that the tooth was contributing significantly, not allowing any of it to clear up while it was present. I'll update the post later on so others get an idea of what's possible when it comes to infections. Thank you for your reply!\n\nIt doesn't appear to be a dry socket. It started out like it should: a red jelly like clot in the socket that eventually filled up to gum level. After a day or so, it's changed to various shades of a white-ish substance that is covering the wound. Hopefully this is the good stuff I've read about there made of blood vessels and such, and not just puss and food particles and doesn't count as protection against dry socket."

    "title": "Horrible Tooth Extraction",
    "dialogue": "jasonp82: Hi everyone,\nI'm new here as I'm freaking out regarding a tooth extraction I had last Wednesday, the 19th.  It was determined I needed a 3rd molar removed that never came through the gums.  There was also a wisdom tooth sideways, possibly wedged against it but very close to it nonetheless.  I had a consultation at the oral surgeon and screened them quite extensively as I've never had anything like this done before (have all my wisdom teeth other than this one that was extracted).  They did a full mouth xay and it was noted they would need to break my wisdom tooth up as it was right with a nerve that ran along my lower jaw.  I had some odd requests - I wanted to be awake, and I also required an anesthetic that did not have ephinephrine (not really related, but just putting everything out there)\n\nThe extraction, according to the doctor, was quite difficult.  It took about 45 minutes.  Obviously, I was awake.  The doctor told me \"no one in the country had it worse than you did today\".  They told me I'd be quite sore for several days and I was given five prescriptions.  \n\nWhen I got home, I thought they must have really given me a lot of anesthetic, because I was still partially numb in my lower left lip area.  That's something that has never gone away.  I still have only partial feeling there a week later.  A week later, I still have horrible pain that I can trace back to the hole that is still healing, but it also seems to be really bad in the lower lip and radiates on the left side of my face as high as my temple and ear.  I have been able to hear my heart beating in my left ear since the operation when the pain is present.   My teeth and gums seem to hurt at times.\n\nToday, for the first time, I was able to drink something without severe pain.  The bouts of severe pain seem to come and go - days have been okay the last two days, night times have been very painful.   When I went back for follow up yesterday, they took a look at it and said it looked like it was healing well and offered to put a plastic-looking piece in the hole but said it wasn't absolutely necessary, but I'd have to come back...and with my job, I didn't want to have to go back so I declined.  \n\nIt was also mentioned that I likely have some nerve damage/irritation, which is still in the unknown right now given I still don't have complete sensation in my lower lip.  They did some pricking, and I can feel everything, but it's just a really distorted feel.  My lip was extremely bruised and injured when I left there and remains this way...and this is where the numbness is as well.  My jaw (understandbly) is still very sore, and I cannot open my mouth very far.  My throat is also bruised as they were pressing down trying to give me \"chin support\".   \n\nThis is just not what I expected.  While I am hoping that everything resolves once I am all healed up, I am worried to death...  Has anyone ever dealt with this?  Sometimes the pain is so great, I can't even tell if it's coming from my mouth or not.  I can only assume it is though...\n\nI am just frustrated as it appeared during the consultation and required extra x-ray, there was a plan in place...but I noticed the x-ray was not pulled up until half way through the process when complications were evident.  I'm just praying this is just slow healing from a bad procedure and it's nothing more... Dr M: Good day\n\nWith a difficult extraction, especially a lower tooth, there is a higher chance of dry socket formation. I am sure that the oral surgeon should have mentioned the risks of dry socket formation to you, prior to the extraction. Usually for a dry socket, you need to to back to the surgeon, so that the area can be cleaned out.\nThe partial numbness could be because of 2 reasons.\n1) If the molar was indeed close to the inferior alveolar nerve, the nerve could have sustained \" bruising \" or damage, due to the extraction process. This is a common risk. It takes time for the feeling to return, Sometimes it takes a few weeks, sometimes a few months.\n2) Alveolitis or infection of the socket, could lead to partial loss of feeling in the area, until the infection is cleared.\n\nMy advice would be to go back to the surgeon for a follow-up visit. jasonp82: Hi there Dr M. I did actually go back for a follow up visit on Tuesday.  They said it appears to be healing well and offered to put a plastic-looking thing in the hole, but said I would need to come back and said it wasn't absolutely necessary.  I declined.  I was glad to hear it was healing well at least.   They did clean it out.  Though they said the symptoms of tinnitis, and pain in the ear on the left side, etc were not normal, they said I should come back in a month.   So I guess it's kind of wait and see as of right now.   I just hadn't ever spoken to anyone who dealt with symptoms quite like this before. Dr M: Sometimes patience is all that is required. Our bodies can sometimes heal quite nicely by itself. jasonp82: I hope you are right!  I have figured out where the numbness-lack of sensation is.  It is definitely the mental nerve. Dr M: Most likely it is the inferior alveolar nerve, especially when it was injured during a 3rd molar extraction. The inferior alveolar nerve does also supply the lip on the associated side. jasonp82: Thank you so much for the information.  I know it's just basically a watch and wait game at this point as I am still healing.  As I mentioned, the procedure was not easy (their words).  Is it normal to still be in pain?  I still have two healing holes in my mouth, from each tooth.  So I can see why I'm still in pain, and I believe I won't be eventually but it will be 2 weeks since the operation in a couple of days.  When I went back before, they offered to put a plastic-like piece in one of the holes but advised it wasn't 'required'.  It just seems like everyone else I've known was not in pain after a few days!    I am going to try to attach a photo... I hope it's not too scary.  On the right side, there is  a \"crack\" in my gums...this leads to hole #1, which was one of the teeth extracted under the gums.  The other hole is obviously the wisdom tooth."

Don't feel pain for most of the time and if i do its 3/10 pain. However, after my tightness went away i notice weird lump nect to the stitches. Can someone help me indentify it? After tooth removal i got antibiotics and mouthwash from pharmacy to use after surgery. I don't think lump causes any pain, it's annoying becasue keep biting on it when trying to fully close my mouth as it gets on thr way between teeth. Dr M: Good day\n\nThis is nothing to worry about. Sometimes the tissue forms a \"knot or lump\" due to the stitches. Over time this will disappear as healing progresses."

    "dialogue": "holimolicanoli: I'm a bit worried because there's still a small hole 10 weeks after extraction. The healing process might've been slowed down because I mistakenly dislodged the blood clot on day one by gently rinsing my mouth before reading the instructions not to do that. I only wanted to get rid of some of the blood taste.\nThe bleeding stopped after I placed fresh gauze on it several times, which created a blob of blood on top of the hole.\nI assumed this was a new blood clot and I left it alone from then on. Eventually this blood clot just disappeared along with the sutures, and a hole remained visible. Thankfully there was only mild pain, so no dry socket.\nIs there some point where you'd say that the hole isn't going to close? Like 4 months or something? Or does it just take much longer to heal in some cases?\nI'm at 3 months soon and I'm worried that I either have to go back for surgery to close the hole, or that I'll have to keep using this syringe forever to keep the hole clean. Dr M: Good day\n\nHow do you know there is still a hole? Can you see it or do you only feel it with your tongue? A lot of times patients mistake sockets for being \" open \", because they can feel an indentation which they then mistake for an open hole. This is most likely because the socket has not been filled up with bone yet, although it is still actually closed with soft tissue and immature bone. For a socket to \"heal\" so that it \" feels \" closed or smooth, it can take up to 6 months for the process of bone formation and resorption to complete. By that stage the alveolar bone should be at a more or less horizontal level. holimolicanoli: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tGood day\n\nHow do you know there is still a hole?

I thought there was a hole because there was a dark spot in there and I was able to place the syringe a bit deeper in that spot. Though maybe I was just pushing the syringe into the soft tissue.

I'm not sure if food can pass through there but I'll just keep cleaning the area with the saltwater syringe until it the soft tissue smoothens out. Thank you."

    "dialogue": "Linder: Hi,\nI had a bad tooth  for awhile and when the lock downs hit, no one would deal with me. This caused massive infection to go through me, off and on. I would get antibiotics to kill most of it by presp. from dentist and that's all they would offer.  In 2021 all I heard for the next year was we're backed up 9 months. So just recently since everything has calmed down, I had a miracle and got an appointment at my dentist, an  xray showed  my root fractured in an upside down V. I currently had a red eye and swelling, and was told to do eyedrops. Three days later the extraction was horrendous, as the surgeon pulled hard and caused a lot of trauma on me. He got the complete tooth out after 2 minutes. He was known as a good surgeon for the reason why my dentist sent me to him. I was given penicillin and sent home with instructions, which i followed. After a day, the bleeding stopped and I removed the gauze and did nothing. I had intense pain from shots.  I ate soft foods and avoided the area, 1 day later started gently swishing with salt water. The thing ached a little. I had swelling for a week, and a black and blue mark on my chin. I recently went through all my antibiotics, I still have a red eye, and a little pain above eyebrow on head, feels like a headache. The swelling has gone down a lot, yet I have traces of light swelling. My question is  what causes a dull pain now to be going through other teeth and every now and every now and then I get a small dull pain from extraction. I don't have bad breath, nor is the pain intense. My left eye burns and is red. It's been 12 days, should I get any more meds for my eye, do you think I have an infection in my head? I read on another forum that this dentist said in his 30 years he's never seen an infection in the brain. That your immunity kills most bacteria from abscesses.  So does any of this sound normal as I have never had a tooth pulled. Is this normal healing for all the infection that I had over the years?  \nI'm afraid to take a pic of it, or look at it. honestly honestdoc: Penicillin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic compared to Amoxicillin.  I'm suspecting that your infection is not fully resolved.  Go back to the surgeon for a follow up.  It is impossible to diagnose you in this forum. Linder: The oral surgeon is 180 miles away, as I live in an area of only 4 dentist.   I went to my dentist and he said the tooth is healing well. He gave me amoxicillin to  take, I just don't understand the pain in my jaw as well as extracted area, which is now pain is going up to the teeth on upper area. The extraction looks solid white, and the dentist told me it's filling in, if he packed it, it would just go backwards. honestdoc: Wow, can you go to your physician to get your eye checked and make sure you don't have a fever and all your lymph nodes are ok.  At this point, finish your Amoxicillin and hope it resolves.  I understand it is very hard to travel that far. Linder: On the day I went to the dentist, which I don't believe he diagnosed it correctly, I went next door to my  doctor about my eye. She said I had allergies, I do have symptoms of allergies. It is really bad this year, anyway the more I live with this pain, the more I realize this is a dry socket. I feel the dentist was wrong, the medical system here is terrible and very back woods. I myself feel its the bone that I see as at night the pain runs through that area and now going to the upper teeth. I have no fever-97, no bad taste, none of the symptoms that go with a dry socket. I have a sinus headache as I sneeze a lot and my head is stuffed. I also feel the amoxicillin isn't helping the pain and I read that dry sockets heal on their own in a week or two. I will continue to take the medz and see what happens, other than that I'm clueless of this pain. honestdoc: I'm sorry for your suffering.  I'm working emergencies this morning and my assistant went home sick.  According to a respected pharmacist who spoke at our conference.  You can take a cocktail of  ibuprofen 600 mg (3 caps) and eat because it tears up your stomach, Tylenol, and Benadryl at night.  In the morning, switch Benadryl to caffeine.  If those don't work, have your dentist prescribe you something stronger."

    "title": "Did my tooth extraction fail?",
    "dialogue": "Barkermush: I recently (4 days ago) had a failed root canal tooth removed. Lower first molar I think.  It was via an NHS emergency dentist. This is my first ever tooth extraction, so it's all new to me.\n\nAnyway the removal was horrendous, the lady really struggled with it. She was switching between so many tools and different angles, and applying so much pressure I thought my gum was going to pop. I finally felt and heard a crunch after about 10 minutes of severe pressure.\n\nShe said that's one part of the tooth out just one more part to go. Which she said she had lost, she could feel it with her tool but couldn't see it. So after some painful digging around.. she finally said she had it. Then after 5 more minutes of painful crunching/bending and pulling we were done. Both parts were out.\nThis experience was awful and painful throughout but I don't want to get into that. Afterwards she said 2 times unprompted, that all of the tooth is out and there is no need to worry.\n\n\nI've been in agony for the past 4 days, been taking amoxicillin (3 times a day for 5 days, 1 tablet left to take soon) and over the counter pain killers.\nBut it's still swollen and sore, I keep getting shooting pains down my neck and under my jaw. Short and infrequent but severe when they happen.\nAnyway the blood clot as started to fade color now and I can see the extraction area.. and to me it looks like there is still some tooth in there? But I'm no expert, got my wife to take a picture.. sorry it was hard to get a good shot.\n\nBut to me it looks like there is still some tooth in that extraction site.\nI'm worried this emergency dentist botched the extraction. She didn't x-ray it afterwards (or before) she never washed it out with saline etc after we were done. She just stuck a gauze in, got me straight up out of the chair (even though I was failing faint after all that) she said don't worry she won't let me leave till it's stopped bleeding.\n\nShe then got her assistant to get a prescription for the amoxicillin, did it on her computer..and then give me the prescription and sent me on my way. In the space of 2 minutes, she'd either forgot or didn't want to check if it was still bleeding.\nLike I said she didn't x-ray it before, but she was using an old x-ray of the tooth which was taken almost 2 years before by a previous emergency dentist.\n\nThat dentist who took the x-ray in the past.. said it was a failed root canal, and that it would be a really difficult tooth to pull. She was hesitant about pulling it, but she said it could be sorted with another root canal if I could get a permanent dentist. They couldn't do it because they are an emergency dentist, and told me I would need my own regular dentist to do it. So she cleaned the tooth, changed the filling and put in some anti-bac cream to appease the tooth until I could get a dentist to sort it.\n\nBut I never could get a dentist, due to Covid its been impossible to get a regular dentist in the UK. Anyway the clean out and anti-bac cream did put me on for some 18  months or so.\n\nTil it stared hurting again last weekend, and I got an abscess on the gum below it. Which is why I went back to an emergency dentist 4 days ago.\nThe dentist didn't seem too interested in the abscess or swelling on my cheek. She said it's due to that infected tooth and that we should remove the tooth.\nShe said we will just quickly 'wriggle' it out and call it a day. I said fine, as it does need to go.. it's been 2 years and still no dentists taking new patients on. But I found it strange that she said we will just quickly wriggle it out.. When the previous dentist had said it would be a nasty pull (she was right) There certainly no wriggle about it, felt like she was trying to snap my upper leg bone \nAfterwards she jokingly said it was a very naughty tooth.. I was in too much pain for any jokes.\n\nAnyway, so 4&half days later and I still have the abscess on my gum, the amoxicillin hasn't cleared it. It's actually worse after that extraction, along with the rest of the pain down that side.\n\n>>TO SUM IT UP <<\nSorry for the long drawn out post. Anyway to sum it up(too much for some to read) it's my first tooth extraction and I'm worried that the Dentist didn't do a good job. I got the feeling she was rushing it, and afterwards couldn't get me out of there quick enough. I noticed she had another patient in the waiting room on my way out.\n\nI felt it was strange the way she twice unprompted said don't worry, all of tooth is out (it seemed disingenuous) Felt like she was just trying to move me along, as she was only an emergency dentist to me and will never see me again.\n\nThen to top it all off, I googled reviews for the dentist.. I found this review posted 5 months before:\n\n\"Very bad experience, my whole face hurts. I've had 2 teeth removed in the past and neither of those were so painful as this one. I'm all bruised up still and I couldn't eat for 3 days straight now.\"\n\nThe fact that person has had 2 removed before, and they felt the one with this dentist was awful.. making me think it's not just me, and it's not normal for a tooth extraction to hurt that much. \n\nI just want to make sure I'm not just being paranoid, and get an opinion from other people in the know. If the extraction site looks as should be, I will leave it be and let heal. If not, I don't want it healing to have it cut open again down the line. Barkermush: Been to another Dentist this morning.\nI have a dry socket, even though I took every precaution not to get a dry socket.\n\nHe said sometimes with a traumatic tooth extraction, you get a dry socket no matter what.\n\nGood news that there was no tooth left behind though  Apparently what I could see was the bone of the socket. Linder: Barkermush that sounds like what I have even though my dentist said it's healing well. I had a traumatic tooth extraction earlier this month and it aches around extraction, when you see the bone of the socket, does this look white where the tooth was extracted?\nI have solid white over area where tooth was pulled and wondered if this was bone."

I have no idea how it happened, and there was no filling, no visible cavity, no physical trauma. I don't do chewing gum and don't drink sugary sodas at all, but occasionally I eat a few snacks or chocolates. I brush my teeth everyday before I sleep. I don't smoke or drink alcohol. I haven't had any root canals, or fillings done, or anything on my teeth in general, I do not visit the dentist unless a health issue comes up.

I do not want to trust him, as he kept talking about irrelevant issues such as my overbite (which my orthodontist was okay with not fixing because of my mouth shape), my bite in general (he asked me to show my teeth then immediately said I was holding them down wrong and giving myself issues), my supposed last issue with lower left molar (he has it written down that I suffered a lower left issue last time I visited, which is a fabricated lie!), then he kept incessantly telling me off about me being stubborn (as if I was a child).

It all started with a crack down its middle, then the whole thing fell apart while I was eating cake. I have no idea how it happened, and there was no filling, no visible cavity, no physical trauma. I don't do chewing gum and don't drink sugary sodas at all, but occasionally I eat a few snacks or chocolates. I brush my teeth everyday before I sleep. I don't smoke or drink alcohol. I haven't had any root canals, or fillings done, or anything on my teeth in general, I do not visit the dentist unless a health issue comes up. I am generally physically healthy and cannot come to terms with this just happening out of nowhere. I went to the dentist yesterday and he said there is barely any tooth left so I need either extraction and/or implantation. I have another molar that also broke in the same spot, but upper left.

I went to a different dentist and he did a crown on my upper left, which I have had for two weeks now. Very happy that I can actually chew my food, as opposed to using my front teeth lol. \n\nThe other molar unfortunately still needs extraction, which might take a while for me to get to. \n\nAs for the underlying issue, I don't know. No one told me anything, and dentists mostly focus on fixing issues and don't like to explain causes (from my experience). I don't know how they teach them in school, and the ignorance is killing me (inside).\n\nI still grind my teeth though. I am scared of breaking my new crown. I try not to do that, at least when I'm awake, because my parents have not financially recovered yet from the crown.\n\nHope this helps somehow Hopefulgirl, whatever your issue. Hopefulgirl: Oh great that is good news because dental issues can be some of the hardest and most difficult to resolve especially to the point of being comfortable.\n\nIf you absolutely have to get an extraction, I strongly advise a replacement tooth in that spot especially if it’s a molar tooth because missing molars more than likely causes balance issues to the bite hence TMJD.  If you are still grinding that sorta says something is still unbalanced as well in your bite since people grind when the muscles are trying to find the bite, but yes protect that new crown and your teeth at all cost. Use a thin night guard while sleeping, emphasis on thin lol.\n\nAs for me my issues is that a dentist misshaped my molar tooth so bad that it has thrown my bite off. I have balance issues and teeth that are hitting uncomfortably so I think my fix would be getting that molar built back up properly or a crown. And as far as how dentist are taught in school,  it’s actually a lot they don’t know, never learn and have all wrong! I’ve read books and watched videos from other brave dentist that will admit that they have been doing a lot wrong and there’s  a lot they just don’t know and have not learned about the bite! And I agree! I can tell because too many mess up time and time again. Hopefulgirl: soulbee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHi!\n\nI'm doing great.

But omg I’m dealing with a liar dentist as well! I truly believe these dentist lie to us about the condition of things, they’ve also been known to destroy teeth for money. I wouldn’t be surprised if that dentist destroyed  your teeth to make you get expensive implants. Did you see him in the past before the broken teeth? I had a dentist purposely destroy my tooth! I had no cavities. You should really try hard and think how did you get that crack in your teeth. soulbee: Thank you for your nice replies.\n\nAlso many thanks for your advice and the information about balance issues. I think I understand a lot now about why the dentist who did my crown was so annoyed with how I wasn't able to bite down. \n\nFor context, what he was doing was polishing the top of the crown so it fits neatly on my bottom teeth. He inserts a blue strip in between and asks me to bite down hard as if I were grinding on it, and now I understand from you that grinding is what folks do when their bite is unbalanced.\n\nAs for the reason my upper right broke, I am pretty sure I had that crack right after I took my braces off. Maybe the braces were holding the tooth together, and when they came out, it finally fell apart? At least I suspect so, and I had many times a thought that something was going on back there, but I wrongfully labelled my thoughts anxiety and moved on.\n\nI am glad you figured out your dentist is a liar. I can't imagine the trauma behind that, paying money expecting treatment and care and only getting worse. This is why I only go to the dentist for immediate issues. Reading online and researching is better to quell that fear of ignorance, and sometimes if it ain't broke don't fix it. I can't exactly say I recommend this philosophy, but what's the alternative? Humans are prone to error in many ways, and the nuances of who's right or wrong and whose opinion to take can be hard to resolve. I hope you got out of that awful dentist situation woth grace and resilience."

    "dialogue": "MattTwinstar: I have a #2 molar in the upper right part of my mouth that was incorrectly extracted about 2-3 years ago. The dentist \"said\" it was out but come to find out as of a week ago when I experienced a weird popping sensation and sever excruciating pain that the dentist shattered my tooth and left both halves of my roots still in the gums. I am now informed that I have to go see an oral surgeon to have it surgically removed.\n\nI am incredibly PTSD and Anxiety struck over anything to do with the dentist let alone surgery. My past experiences with terrible and honestly not properly certified to work on patients teeth/mouth has caused me to have terrible fears and worries and always thinking the worst. (Because in the past the worst has happened)\n\nI am worried that im not going to be at ease or feel the pain. My last experience I had a dentist use the maximum amount of lidocane to numb me up and the legal dose he could give a human and I felt every minute of the pain. It was the longest 7 minutes of my life. Now then a surgery is taking place i just dont want to be in pain.\n\nCan anyone give me advice or experiences of similar surgical procedures to help me stop over thinking and giving myself panic attacks? I really am worried. Please. \nThank you to anyone who takes the time to respond.\n\nBest Regards Dr M: Good day\n\nSorry to hear about your bad experience. The dentist should have informed you of any fractured left behind. A lot of time teeth can fracture during an extraction process. There are a lot of factors that influence this. And a lot of time, tooth pieces can be left behind, if it is proximity to anatomical important structures, to prevent damage. But again, the dentist should have informed you of this. \nThere is a chance that the root pieces might be removed in theater under GA. If this is the case, there should be any discomfort during the process. If your surgeon does not advise GA, discuss your fears with your surgeon. There are other pre-medications that can be prescribed in order to reduce your anxiety."

Until now….\n\nAbout two weeks ago (5 weeks post extraction), I noticed that the upper molar next to the two upper extraction sites feels strange—almost like it’s being pressed on. I am constantly feeling this weirdness/pressure in the tooth all day and night.  Even more concerning is the fact that, when I chew on that side of my mouth, the sharp pain in the molar is excruciating. \n\nI’ve consulted multiple times with my oral surgeon, his colleague, and my regular dentist. All seem to brush me off and nobody will tell me if this is normal, when it might resolve itself, or what I can do in the meantime.\n\nIs this something anyone else has experienced?

Since then, I had periods of toothache which was very different than every other toothache I've experienced. It would come and go and It would usually hurt when I drank water or ate some hard solids.\nIt doesn't hurt currently (it hasn't since April), but I still feel some small bump just above the gumline. Also, the nostril that's on the same side as those teeth doesn't move as much. My nose looks much more asymmetrical than it did before the surgery (the left nostril is much higher than the right one when I smile).\nMy dentist says there's nothing in the xray and that it's probably normal. Another dentist suggested tooth extraction, but he said he couldn't guarantee that the symptoms would go away.\n\nSo, my question is - what's the possible cause of this, should I see some other type of doctor? Could it be tumor?\n\nI am very sorry for such a long post, but I am getting a little paranoid and I feel very self conscious because I already have asymmetrical face and now it looks even worse. Dr M: Good day\nDo you perhaps have any post-op x-rays that you can share? The small bump that you feel, might be an area of hypertrophied tissue or scar tissue, in the area where the initial incision was made. MattKW: X-rays pre- and post-op please. Photo of the small bump too if possible. Having done many apicocectomies, and knowledge of the anatomy typically involved, I deeply doubt that your nostril position has changed. There is no anatomical or surgical basis for this to have occurred after an apico. Nearly EVERYONE has an asymmetrical face. Many movie stars and television presenters are often chosen because they have fairly symmetrical faces, so don't compare yourself to them - have a look at this site, or upload pictures of yourself and friends here."

    "dialogue": "RollingMenhir: I have been dealing with a recurrent oral mucocele in my lower right buccal mucosa for roughly half a year’s worth of time (it started occurring late November last year). The problem I am facing is that apparently, I can only have it excised when it is present (i.e., swollen), but the mucocele usually occurs at random intervals (between three to seven days) and at random times (sometimes in the late afternoon when most of the oral health surgeons near me are closing up for the day or on weekends) and I cannot do anything to make it occur manually. The reason why I assume it can only be excised when swollen is from my sole consultation with and later visit to a specific oral health surgeon (whom my dentist referred me to), who said in both instances that “I cannot do surgery if it’s not there”. Essentially, I would be forced to have to make an appointment on the same day the mucocele occurs to have it excised, and that is frustrating since not only can I not predict when the mucocele occurs, but some of the oral health surgeons around me will not accept same day appointments.\n\nIs there any other possible treatment I can undergo to have it excised? Can I have it excised even if it is not swollen? Or is it the norm for recurrent mucoceles in that they can only be excised when they are swollen rather than at any other time (in theory, since these are usually caused by a damaged salivary duct, would it still be possible to treat them just by fixing the duct)? I want to have this mucocele excised as soon as possible and I don’t want to be held down by whenever it shows up to schedule my appointment. nikroute: Your age , diet habbits with teeth edges needs to be checked .

If I’ve had lumps in my mouth in the past, they were either consistent yet temporary (I.E. swollen for a few days and then gone) or were just aphthous ulcers. I went to two different dentists and both said they could remove it but it would just come back so they deferred me to oral surgery for permanent removal.\n\nI’m not sure what triggers it. I tried to trigger it several times using spicy or acidic foods but it never seemed to work (neither would eating said foods while it was swollen prolong how long it was swollen). And foods that I had thought caused it would not work the second time around. As for my diet, my diet has been relatively consistent for the past few years so I don’t think that’s the cause (like I said, it only started late last year)."

    "dialogue": "C908: I was just told by my dentist my #3 tooth on top right needs to be removed. I was told I could do a 3 unit bridge or a bonegraft with an implant. I'm 67 with no dental insurance. As a child I was hurt by a dentist so this problem I have scares me. I told them I must be put under before this work can be done. My concerns with the bridge are weather or not the connecting teeth can hold up long term. My #2 tooth already has a crown. I don't like the idea of cutting off a perfectly good crown just to replace it with another crown. It seems to me this is just asking for trouble. My #4 tooth seems to be OK, I don't like the idea of filing it down to accommodate another crown.Another concern is the longevity of a bridge.Im reading 5 to 7 yrs is average,  10 years or more if your lucky.For approximately $3400.00 I feel it should last longer.Even though the expense is greater I guess I am slightly leaning towards the bone graft and implant. The bone graft scares me and the healing time concerns me. I'm looking at approximately $5500.00 for this procedure. This is a lot of money when your retired living on Social Security. I am shocked that it cost this much money to fix a problem caused by 1 tooth. I would have considered not replacing the extracted tooth if it wasn't for the fact the surrounding teeth will shift. My parents paid for me to have braces when I was a child. Because of this I have always tried to maintain my teeth the best I can. With the prices that are charged today I can understand why people are walking around with missing teeth. I would like to say thank you in advance for your comments. Thisbites: Hi\nI too have issues and concerns about how we are having to pay this kind of money for an implant. Im sorry noone has answered your question as mine was not answered either, even with several xrays.  \nWonder why the site is up? Oh well. Good luck to you and hoping your tooth is replaced with a long lasting one.\nTake care"

It had a temporary filling on it.\n\nI am very concerned that the dentist has not completed the work correctly. He put in stitches but only one stitch looks correct over a cut in my gum where an earlier extraction took place. The other stitches are just running up one side of the socket and not pulling the gums closed. So I am left with a painful gapping hole.\n\nCan a dentist give an opinion please. I am still getting pain in the area. I was given about 7 injections. One to the back of the jaw then about 5 injections around the tooth and another final one down one side of my jaw. Seems excessive for a tooth sitting normally. The dentist took the tooth out in pieces which I don't think was necessary. I am still in pain about 8 days after the extraction.\n\nLuckily I can include a photo of an x-ray of my tooth area (cropped) and I managed to get some photos done with my mobile phone, not an easy task.\n\nThank you for any replies.\n\nPeter Dr M: Good day\nStitches are not always placed to fully close a socket. If the tooth was erupted, such as in your case, the stitches are placed where incisions are made or where tissues were torn. Often there is still a hole left behind, to allow blood clot formation. \nThe fact that you have pain, might be an indication though that you have a dry socket. This happens when the blood clot is disturbed or if food gets into the socket. This is more common in bottom extractions and in some cases the stitches accidentally trap food particles, which if not rinsed out correctly, also leads to dry socket formation.\nI would arrange a follow up visit with your dentist/oral surgeon, to make sure that don't have a dry socket, and if you do, to treat it accordingly. pduffy4: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tGood day\nStitches are not always placed to fully close a socket.

You might even sometimes experience bone particles coming out through the gum at a later stage.\nIf you are scared that it is root pieces left in situ, you will have to take a new x-ray"

About 2 years ago, the impacted tooth peeped out of the gums on the side, and since then about 1/4 of the tooth has become visible.  The tooth is at a 45 degree angle underneath my second molar, and has dissolved half of the roots on the second molar.  The same situation happened on the bottom wisdom tooth when I was 16, and the dentist just pulled the second molar and the wisdom tooth came in just fine (still 45 degree crooked but fully erupted, anyway). \nI went to an oral surgeon, and he said pulling the second molar this time would still not allow the tooth to fully erupt because I am 31 years old and teeth do not erupt anymore when you get that old.  Then I read online about how supra-eruption occurs at any age, and I know the tooth has moved some recently because it sticks out farther now than when the gums still covered it.\nMy question is, is it true that pulling the second molar would not help because I am too old, and the wisdom tooth would just sit in its partially erupted state from now on?  Or would it finish erupting after the second molar on top of it was removed? honestdoc: I believe the oral surgeon is partially correct in terms of eruption.  Everyday your teeth will shift while the opposing and adjacent teeth will  limit its extent.  The wisdom teeth will shift less since your bone is much more dense at 31 than at 17.  If the 2nd molar is damaged, it needs to be extracted. strivingbowl: Can teeth still erupt past 25-30 years old if they were blocked by another tooth prior? honestdoc: It is unpredictable and any eruption can be very slow due to more dense bone."

Now both teeth have pain with hot and cold liquids and foods, sharp pain with hot and cold, the tooth throbs and pain lingers after hot and cold, a constant toothache and pain with biting and chewing.\n\nI saw my dentist three weeks ago. He examined these and the nearby teeth, took x-rays and testing the teeth with endo ice. Both #24 and #25 were positive testing to the endo ice and positive with the tapping on the teeth.\n\nHe said the x-rays look fine. No signs of disease or illness other than the one tooth being chipped. He referred me to the endodontist for a consultation and root canal treatment and sent the x-rays to them.\n\nI saw the endodontist for a consult yesterday Tuesday, November 2, 2021. I’ve seen this doctor before and he knows my history. I had a 3D cone beam CT scan performed at this appointment. I also had regular digital x-rays taken of the teeth in the area. He examined teeth numbers 22, 23, 24 and 25. Tooth #22 was normal to all testing. Tooth #23 actually surprised me and hurt the worst at this time. Tooth #23 the doctor told me had a previous root canal treatment, maybe 2-3 years ago. The tooth tested positive to all tests including tapping, gum probing, biting on cotton and cold testing. He showed me the digital x-ray that showed the tooth has extensive damage to the tooth and the surrounding gums. He diagnosed it with External Tooth Root Resorption. I’ve heard this diagnosis a few times before with different teeth. This is considered an auto-immune disease that only affects the teeth. It’s thought to be caused by trauma which in my case is likely the double jaw surgery I had in 2014 in addition to adult braces. He said the previous root canal treatment on #23 is breaking down and no longer helping the tooth. He said that normally he’d recommend a root canal re-treatment but that in this case it would be likely to fail. The tooth is too fragile and weak and he is also concerned about the surrounding gum tissue. This is why the re-treatment is not recommended. His recommendation is to extract this tooth and to replace it with an implant. The implant would be placed 2-3 months after the extraction giving the surgical site time to heal. I may need a bone graft but they won’t know until my dentist sees me.\n\nSo teeth #s 24 and 25 are also a possible cause for concern. These teeth did test positive to the tapping and biting on cotton. I did feel cold pain with these teeth also but he said they were within normal ranges at this time. This seemed odd to me because when my dentist tested those two teeth they hurt me a ton with the cold test. The endodontist said that this may be because tooth #23 is hurting me so bad. After #23 has healed from the extraction, about 2 weeks, he wants to see me again to re-test #24 and #25. These teeth may need root canal treatments but it’s hard to know at this time with #23 hurting so badly right next to the other suspect teeth.\n\nAs soon as I got all of this news my anxiety and stress levels got out of control. I felt like I wanted to cry in the dental chair. I think I was just in shock at the time.\n\nRight after the appointment I called my dentist and their next opening for an extraction appointment was a month and a half out. I took the appointment and then called around to a couple of Oral Surgeon offices to get their recommendations and appointment availability. The Oral Surgeon has an appointment on Thursday, November 11, 2021 in the afternoon. They said they could do a consult and treatment in the same day. They could also do my implant later on. I took this appointment and cancelled the other one. This tooth #23 is hurting me so bad that I just can’t wait any longer. The office does offer Nitrous Oxide which I told them I want to use for this appointment. It’s the only way I can get through dental treatment without having a panic attack.\n\nThe Endodontist is also very concerned about my gums around this tooth #23. He measured the pockets at the appointment and that really hurt. I had a bone and gum graft on my six lower front teeth about four years ago and this tooth was part of that. He wants me to see my Periodontist again to re-evaluate this tooth and the rest of the bone and gum graft. We’re hoping the grafts are not failing.\n\nI’ve been alternating taking OTC Tylenol and Aleeve. I was advised several years ago to try to avoid Ibuprofen due to a stomach condition called Gastritis. I was so stressed at the Endodontist appointment that I forgot to ask what to take for pain. I called the next day and they are calling in a prescription of Hydrocodone and Ibuprofen 800 mg. They are aware of the stomach issue and said that taking it short term should not cause any issues.\n\nThese teeth are just hurting a lot. The pain is keeping me up and waking me at night. During the day it hurts so bad that I'm distracted at work and during regular daily activities. I'm stressed and anxious not knowing what will happen. I still have these potential root canal treatments hanging over my head.\n\nI’m super anxious, stressed and nervous about meeting a new doctor the Oral Surgeon and of the procedure of the extraction and the future procedure of the implant. I’ve had extractions before but it was 8 teeth at once to prepare for my double jaw surgery so I had IV sedation at that time. I think in comparison the nitrous will work for just one tooth. The appointment is supposed to be 1 hour and 15 minutes for the consult and extraction at the same time.\n\nI’ve never had an implant before so the unknown of a new procedure is really freaking me out. I also plan to use the nitrous for this future procedure.\n\nI was told years ago when I had my first root canal treatment that being that I was so young that the root canals would likely have to be re-treated and the teeth would break down over time causing the need for extractions. I just hoped this wasn’t true and never expected it to happen so soon. I’m afraid this is just the beginning of more future extractions to come.\n\nThis auto-immune disorder External Tooth Root Resorption is a rare condition and in my case is very aggressive. This is at least my third diagnosis in 2-3 years.\n\nI've attached the x-ray is anyone is curious. If you look at the tooth #23 you can see the old root canal breaking down. Also if you look for the circle in the middle of the tooth that is the Resorption.\n\nI'm now 4 days post-op from #23 being extracted.  I asked the Oral Surgeon about the External Resorption and it's likely progression and prognosis concerning my other teeth.  He said that since this disease is very rare and aggressive it's hard to say.  He thinks it will likely attack the rest of my teeth one by one leading to root canal treatments and eventually more extractions.\n\nI've already had 18 of my teeth root canaled in 10 years.  A lot of these teeth the root canal treatments are begining to fail and causing me pain again.\n\nI have about 10 'healthy' teeth left and right now 7 of them are having pain and signs of illness.  Three of them may need root canal treatments but I'm waiting to see the Endodontist this week.\n\nI was told a few years ago that my teeth are so fragile that they will all likely need to be extracted at some point and the root canals don't last forever.\n\nI'm seriously considering full mouth extractions right now.  I'm sick and tired of having pain and anxiety about my teeth.  If I did this I would have them all replaced with implants.\n\nHas anyone here had experience with full mouth extractions, implants and/or External Tooth Root Resorption?\n\nFeeling very lost, confused and anxious right now.\n\nI just need some support right now. Thank you for listening to me vent.\n\nJJ"

    "title": "Bone around tooth root still not healing after 3 years - apicoectomy",
    "dialogue": "Kanti: Hello,\nI had an apicoectomy on a lower molar around 4 years ago. About a year ago I had a CBCT done and found out that the bone one of the root tips did not heal yet.\nCan someone please provide me with some explanation to why this could have happened? is it possible that there is an ongoing immune reaction to the synthetic membrane put inside to accelerate bone healing? or is this due to the bacteria?\nI have an unexplained jaw pressure and problems since 2 years. Could this be related to that non-healing bone?\n\nI had an another apicoectomy on the other side 2 years ago (where the extracted tooth location is), but had weird complications there and decided to get the tooth extracted 8 months after the operation. The extraction wound did not heal properly due to unknown reason. I had to go to a biological dentist who opened the wound again, scraped it properly and closed it back again. Now it is better.\n\nI have erupted wisdom teeth, however the lower ones are still pushed back into the jaw as there is not much space left for them.\nThe upper ones are a bit sideways and the is not much place for them either but all 4 are not \"severely\" impacted in that sense. I sometimes have soreness around the upper wisdom teeth. Could this jaw pressure be caused by them although they are not \"visually\" pressing towards nearby teeth? \n\nI attached a picture of the CBCT of the tooth in question (apicoectomy). Also an older panoramic picture where the wisdom teeth are visible (before getting the one tooth removed). honestdoc: I noticed 2 endodontic schools of thought about failing root canals.  The older endodontists will do more apico surgeries while the younger ones will do root canal retreatments and less apicos.  It makes sense because doing apicos without resolving internal disease will fail to heal.  However, my observations are that teeth with multiple attempts at root canals are much more prone to root fracture.  Many times the more predictable option for failing RCTs is to consider implants.  \n\nAre your upper wisdom teeth tipped more towards your cheek?  I see the lower right 3rd molar root apices are very close to a major nerve.  If you're older than 25 years old, it can be more traumatic to remove your wisdom teeth since your bone is more dense and hard. Kanti: @honestdoc thank you for taking the time to answer me.\n\nSo if I understand you correctly, you cannot really tell me or know the reason why do I have such a relatively large unhealed chunk of bone after so many years? can the bacteria be so powerful that the body could not deal with it or does this suggest the existence of another accompanying condition?\n\nYes the upper wisdom teeth are slightly tilted towards the cheeks. The pressure feeling I have is in the upper jaw as well. And I have been having it for about 2 years so far. And no doctor is able to tell me what is causing it. Could those two wisdom teeth be the culprit?\nUnfortunately I am almost 30. I was thinking of getting all of my wisdom teeth out to see if this helps with my chronic severe tinnitus. I was scared of the complications, and you have confirmed them to me. But I assume that removing the upper wisdom teeth shall pose no problem still? honestdoc: There may be 2 possibilities for the radiolucency around the root apex.  It could be a scar with no disease or there is still infection.  Bacteria can get resistant (see Enterococcus Faecalis) but usually if the source of infection (internal root filling) is still there.  Did you follow up with the specialist/surgeon who did the apico procedure?\n\nUpper wisdom teeth are less traumatic to remove.  If you're having problems there, then it will be more predictable to remove them.  Having an experienced surgeon can best manage any complications."

It almost feels as if something more than just my 3 wisdom teeth are missing, Thats the best way I can think of to describe it. I don’t know if it feels that way because new gum tissue is forming/growing back or maybe they removed some of my gum before they could pull the wisdom tooth and that’s what’s giving me this sensation. anyway, is this normal 10 days  after wisdom extraction? Has anyone else experienced this? Will that feeling go away? honestdoc: Every person will respond differently.  What can be abnormal are swelling, intense pain, and more rare, numbness. snojo: Well It’s certainly not intense pain or numbness, but if it’s swelling then wouldn’t that be very noticeable when I look inside my mouth with a mirror. I say that because I don’t really notice anything different besides the slightly open holes where my wisdom teeth used to be.\n\nBy the way, since it’s not intense pain or numbness do you think my mouth will eventually feel the way it used to? Do you think the weird/unusual feeling could be due to new tissue forming? honestdoc: The unusual feeling could be from the healing process.  You may eventually get used to the new conditions."

    "title": "Remove implant crown",
    "dialogue": "Ann444: 18 months ago my general dentist advised that I have all my teeth extracted and have dentures made. She highly recommended snap on dentures on the bottom jaw which has been done. She is unable to do the upper denture for me because I have an implant to replace tooth #10. Besides this implant, I have only seven other teeth, most of my molars are already extracted, so I am not able to chew even with the snap on dentures. I have been looking for a dentist for over a year who can make an upper denture by first removing The implant crown. None of them want to remove the crown. I even waited two months to see the dentist who placed the implant, but then he refused to remove the crown saying that I need to save my teeth with root canal’s and crowns.  He also insulted me by saying I would not have so much decay if I had been seeing a dentist. I had been seeing a dentist twice a month and as soon as a cavity was filled, another one appeared. My regular dentist says my teeth are so decayed and have been filled so many times, that they cannot be saved. I had three teeth crumble because they were filled so many times.  I  dread having dentures but fear I have no alternative, the decay is near the nerves and it’s urgent that something be done. When the molars were extracted, it showed bone destruction. I have been on many, many dental consultations regarding removing the implant crown in the last year. When I call an office they seem to understand and all insist that I come to the office where yet another x-ray is done,  and I’m told this dentist can’t do it. My question is why are dentists who are inserting implants reluctant to remove a crown from an implant and, if it can’t be removed is it possible to make an upper denture around it? Surely with all the implants being done these days,I’m not the only one with this problem.  Seeing all these dentists has become very expensive. I’m a senior citizen living only on social security. Ann444: Can anyone recommend a dentist who is willing and able to make an upper denture around my implant? honestdoc: You seem to have a complicated teeth conditions.  If costs are burdensome, try going to dental school faculty (instructors) for their opinion."

He or she will coordinate treatment with an experienced surgeon (periodontist or oral surgeon) to place the implant.  The restoring dentist may fabricate a surgical guide template to allow the surgeon to place the implant where the dentist will want it.  Usually the surgeon will obtain CT scans to verify safe implant placement away from vital structures such as nerves or sinuses or if the bone is perforated.  All your questions should be answered by the restoring dentist."

    "dialogue": "mna: i've been having this pain in my last molar on the left lower side of the jaw. have been told it's because of an included molar (completely covered in the gum tissue, not exposed). i also had gum pain due to an abscess that formed on the last molar (the visible one). the abscess was drained but i had what i felt was a whole body infection from it - i took what antibiotics i had on hand (cefuroxime) but it didn't eliminate the pain completely, just diminished it. that was almost 2 months ago, now the pain is back along with an unbearable headache and a swollen behind the ear lymph node.\ni have been told i need surgery to remove my wisdom tooth but because of its positioning i have been made aware of many complications: the wisdom tooth touched the mandibular nerve and i have been told i can have permanent nerve damage to that part of the jaw. i also have been told the risk of dry socket and bone infection is higher. but i was told all this by dentists suggesting i get this operation at their practice at a very elevated price.\ni'm afraid to have this operation because of the possible complications and also because of the fact that i believe i have a general gum infection - as i feel pressure like pain in my upper jaw as well.\nshouldn't i take a round of antibiotics before the surgery anyway since - from what i understand - going into a surgery with an active infection is dangerous.\ni'm sitting here with a horrible headache that renders me useless and also nausea and an overall tired feeling in my body. i don't know what to do. the tooth itself doesn't hurt but i've been warned by the dentists it can get a bad infection further down the line.\ni don't even have a recourse here bc i live in a 3rd world country where there are few cabinets who do this procedure and i would have to go to the state operated dental hospital to get it done.\ni feel trapped, what should i do? i have a script for antibiotics (augmentin) form my GP. should i start taking those? i should add i suffer from liver inflammation and i'm afraid to add an known liver toxin like an antibiotic but idk what to do. the drs in my country are very incompetent and i'm afraid....\ni have an xray attached. Dr M: Good day\n\nUnfortunately the risk of nerve damage is always there with an impacted 3rd molar. It is therefore recommended to get the tooth removed by an experienced oral surgeon in order to limit complications.\nIt is also possible that the pain your are experiencing is from your lower left 2nd molar and not the wisdom tooth. On the x-ray provided it looks like you had root canal treatment done on this molar, but this treatment is incomplete, with the mesial root of the tooth completely untreated. This means you might have an infection in that tooth as well.\nToothache is best treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and if there is swelling or signs of infection, antibiotics. If you are worried about liver complications, you can ask for an antibiotic that is safe such as Amoxicillin or Azithromycin, and you should be fine if you follow the dentist/doctor's dosage instructions.\n\nHope this helps. mna: well thanks for the reply, it does help! i have been taking NSAIDS, mostly dexketoprofen.\ni actually have seen an endodontist today and she said to not get the second molar retreated. she said that to her it appears that there's no infection visible on the x-ray (but i know there can be a hidden infection). and she also said i should put a crown on the 2nd molar bc my gum is loose to fill the space, without retreating the tooth.\ni thought it quite odd that she didn't want to do the root canal.\ni have been to a surgeon - an oral surgeon - who was too afraid of the complications to pull out the wisdom molar. i have another appointment with another oral surgeon to get a second opinion."

    "dialogue": "alexfoxy: Hi,\n\nMy girlfriend (33, non smoker) has recently had two molars removed from her upper right set. The two which have been removed are the 1st and the 3rd, counting from the back, leaving the 2nd on its own.\n\nVisually like this: _T_TTTT\n\nThe dentist is advising to have an implant tooth where the 3rd tooth was, involving a sinus lift. Visually you can’t see the gap when she smiles but the dentist said there are lots of potential complications when leaving gaps in your teeth, such as:\n\nmovement of teeth\ntooth decay\nsuper eruption\nsunken face\nConsidering it is quite an invasive operation she is considering not having the implant, however she is worried about the potential complications. How likely are the side effects happening? Would it be foolish not to get it done? She’s very worried about both options so any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nAlex Dr M: Good day\n\nUsually when teeth are removed, some movement can take place since the lone standing molar will try and close the gap. This happens over years, and might involve tilting of that lone standing molar.\nTooth decay can be avoided with normal brushing and flossing and regular check-ups.\nSuper eruption usually only happens if she has a missing lower molar that was opposing the top missing molar.\nSunken face should not be an issue, unless she has several other missing teeth.\nIf she is worried about the consequences of having a missing tooth, she can always try alternative treatments that are cheaper, such as a partial denture. \nAlthough removable, this can be a good temporary option until she has discussed the benefits of an implant at a later stage, since the denture will act as a space maintainer. alexfoxy: Thanks for the response! We will consider the options with this new knowledge. honestdoc: I don't think that dentist is very trustworthy trying to sell her the implants.  The only for certain outcome is minor tooth movement depending on the remaining opposing teeth as Dr M mentioned. jedapo: I got this implant three months after removing the second from back bottom left tooth.

I did wonder if the dentist was pushing his agenda. If money was no object, do the risks of having the procedure done (infection etc) outweigh the risks of leaving it? honestdoc: I'm very conservative (less drilling, less trauma, less complications).  If your GF can function well, then it is prudent to leave it alone.  If she has difficulty chewing, then implants can be beneficial.  I would go to an experienced implant restorative dentist and that dentist would coordinate with the surgeon on implant placement and other necessary work such as sinus lift, bone grafting, etc.  Otherwise like Dr. M mentioned, consider less expensive alternatives like partial dentures.  I would stay away from bridges because it needs a lot of drilling on good teeth and once they get drilled, they are ruined forever.\n\nA lot of my patients cannot afford implants and they are doing fine without them. honestdoc: jedapo said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI got this implant three months after removing the second from back bottom left tooth.

However, my jaw is stiff and my lower second molar has started to tingle and feel sensitive which is causing me discomfort is this a part of the post-op healing or could something be wrong with the bottom tooth because that's the only tooth that is causing pain alongside my jaw that feels like a magnet? also, my dentist has gone on vacation for a few weeks so i  cant contact him for advice.\nThanks. Dr M: Good day\n\nDo you perhaps have any x-rays of your teeth? If there was a post op complication, you would most likely be in severe pain, with a bad taste or smell in your mouth. If this is not the case, it is normal surgical pain, and should subside over time 88dg11: No unfortunately I do not have any xrays but 3 weeks ago my mouth was xrayed and was told nothing  was wrong with my bottom molar. Also, 3 weeks my upper molar was infected so it was root canaled which failed due to fracture that was not seen beforehand hence the extraction so my mouth has been through trauma the last 3 weeks. \nThis makes me think that my left side of my mouth is just tender from all the work done. \nHowever, the pain is not keeping me awake at night like before and there is no throbbing to indicate infection and painkillers seem to subside the pain.\nThanks for your reply Dr M: The pain at the bottom, might then just be normal referred pain from the top. Give it a few days still, and see if the pain gets better. 88dg11: day 6 update\nmy bottom teeth have stopped aching which is a good sign. However, my tooth next to the extraction site feels like there is so much pressure from that area in the next tooth, could this just be swelling from the gums from the extraction and will it settle down. besides, the extraction site is only mild pain which is easily controlled with pain meds. sorry for all the questions it is my first extraction and I'm freaking out a little and my dentist is on vacation.  \nThanks. Dr M: Good day\n\nIf the pain is decreasing, it is a sign that it is healing. Post op surgical pain can sometimes take 2 weeks to disappear. If the pain is still there after about 2 weeks, go back to your dentist to make sure that the remaining molars adjacent to the socket don't have any problems as well."

The implant will be finished by being screwed in and then also using temporary cement so that it can be removed without damaging the crown if needed in case there is an issue. Maybe I misunderstood what the doctor was explaining originally but there will only be removal of the crown if there is some sort of problem. I guess that makes sense.

I drank a little water to see if that would give me a shock of pain and it didn't. Is it a dry socket? Do I need to go to the dentist to get it filled? Is it normal?

Think of it as a wet scab. Perfectly OK and requires no intervention.\nDry sockets will occur 3-4 days post-op and will be one of the worst pains in your life. So, you're well past that date. No need to worry.\nThe hole will gradually fill in with new bone over the next few MONTHS. It won't matter if a bit of food gets occasionally jammed in the healing wound - it will work its way out without your intervention.\nSounds like all is going well!"

    "title": "Dislodged blood clot",
    "dialogue": "Blue Mermaid: Hi, I had a tooth extracted on Wednesday. The dentist could not save it, as it was severely infected, with a large abscess at the root (I have advanced gum disease). During the night, I felt something on my tongue. On a tissue, it looked like a lump of red jelly. I suspected it was the blood clot and looked online to confirm, where I read about dry sockets. I took a picture of the blood clot on the tissue and sent it to the dentist for advice. The next day, he confirmed it was the blood clot but just said, it was normal and not to touch it. I didn't feel reassured, having read that the socket would now be unprotected. So, I asked my dentist for further advice, explaining that I was still concerned after reading about dry sockets. He didn't like me questioning further and sent a very curt and what I consider a rude reply, repeating that it was normal and to stop contacting him with questions, with immediate effect. He said I was not in pain (which wasn't true, I had been in severe pain that night following the extraction but painkillers had helped and I appreciate that this was just post extraction pain) and he suggested I refrain from searching on the internet for issues that I do not have, or will not have. He himself, confirmed the picture I had sent him was the blood clot, so I don't know why he was saying I do not have the issue. I appreciate that not everything you read on the internet is true but I was looking at official sites (such as NHS sites) and when they are all stating the same things, then I believe them to be correct. So, I am left without any further advice from the dentist himself. Could a professional here be kind enough to explain to me, whether I should be concerned that my socket is now left without the protection of a blood clot? Do I now have a dry socket? Should it be cleaned and covered by a gauze or whatever a dentist uses to protect the open socket? Or, is this only if I start to experience new or worse pain? If my dentist had given me a full explanation, as to why he was saying this was normal, then I wouldn't have to look on the internet for advice! Dr M: Good day\n\nIf you disturb the socket, even unknowingly in your sleep, the blood clot can be dislodged yes. The blood clot is part of the normal healing process. This being said, this doesn't mean that the socket will turn into a dry socket. \nA dry socket usually appears after about 3 to 4 days, and is accompanied by a severe pain, sometimes difficulty in opening, and a bad smell.\nMy advice would be to leave the socket alone. Don't brush over the socket to clean it. And then follow the post-op instructions which should have been given to you by your dentist. Keep the area clean, by rinsing with some luke-warm saltwater ( very gently ) about 3 times a day. Keep to a soft diet for the first few days and chew mostly on the opposite side as much as possible.\nThe socket will gradually be filled with granulation tissue as healing progresses and then close normally. MattKW: Loss of a blood clot per se does not cause a dry socket. Rather, the release of chemicals during an extraction can cause early breakdown of the clot by fibrinolysis. Dry sockets occur most often in lower extractions, in difficult or surgical extraction, and in patients who smoke. If it’s going to happen, then it’s already too late to prevent it. The only technique that has been shown to make a small reduction in the risk of developing a d.s. is to start rinsing pre- and post-opratively with a chlorhex mouthwash, Blue Mermaid: Thanks so much to both of you for your replies and for reassuring me. \nIt is good to learn that losing the blood clot does not automatically mean you have a dry socket. Now, I won't worry in the future, if the same thing happens again.\nAll I have left now is some soreness, so I am still eating on the other side and not brushing over the socket. I stopped the salt water rinse after 7 days, as per the instruction leaflet from dentist but I am being meticulous with keeping whole mouth as clean as possible.\nMany thanks again for your kind help and advice."

Dr M: Good day\n\nIt might be that you have a dry socket. This is when the socket becomes infected. It is best that you go back to your dentist, so that the area can be evaluated. The socket will have to be cleaned out, rinsed and then additional medication will be prescribed if required. MattKW: Not a dry socket, and dry sockets are NOT an infection, so are not prescribed antibiotics. Dry sockets occur 3-4 days post-op and are characterised by severe pain, bad taste, and foetid breath. What you are looking at is eith a bit of food sitting there (it'lll do no harm and work its own way out), or some sloughing scar tissue (also no worry).

This is a necessary component that is needed in order to guide the technician in order to make sure that the implant crown's path of placement is correct. You can't guess this.\nA lot of times the oral surgeon sends this with the patient to the dentist. It might be that your dentists has his own components that he uses. Just make sure that if that is the case, that the components are sterile MattKW: Probably not necessary if your general dentist already has the components. These are usually transfer copings etc. Abutment copings are usually bought by the general dentist when the crown is being made by the lab, and may already have been factored into the cost by the general dentist.

I'm concerned because the x-rays of impacted wisdom teeth I'm seeing on google don't show this large black spot around the tooth. Is this something dark area something I should be concerned about ? Dr M: Good day\n\nAn impacted wisdom tooth can sometimes cause a dentigerous cyst formation around the crown of the tooth and then bone loss. This leads to the area that you are seeing on the x-ray. When the oral surgeon removes the wisdom tooth, this area will be scraped clean, and then new bone formation will hopefully occur in the area as normal healing takes place."

So the lingual nerve traverses coronally  in contact effectively with the mandible around the 3rd molar, to the 2nd molar, but then quickly falls apically and medially.  The question I have is in regards to dropping a lingual vertical incision to assist in lingual flap reflection.  \nFor example, doing a crown lengthening on the 2nd lower molar, and trying to remove bone at the disto-lingual position, means the lingual flap has to be stretched quite a bit to allow access.  This stretching is one of the most common causes of lingual nerve injury.  So to avoid this, why wouldn't we drop a slight vertical incision say at the mesial of the second premolar (not deep, just beyond the keratinized attached gingiva) that would allow much more movement of the flap but without risk of stretching it?\n\nAm I missing something here?\n\nThanks honestdoc: Since Periodontists do a lot of crown lengthening procedures, they may provide more insights.  Anecdotally, lingual nerve may situated really close to the coronal aspect and can be risky to flap near it.  Risk vs benefit of your crown lengthening case may not be worth the trouble.  Any alternative treatment options such as extraction, implant, etc. that may be more predictable? ToothFixerUpper: I would agree but I am suggesting a vertical release at the lower premolars which seems to be well clear of the lingual nerve.  Like, not even remotely close.  I just wanted opinions and to see if anyone does this because it isn't discussed in any of the textbooks I have ever read.\n\nThanks\n\n\nhonestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSince Periodontists do a lot of crown lengthening procedures, they may provide more insights.

    "dialogue": "CraigPhillips: Approximately three years ago I had dental implants installed. I first had bone graphs with no problem, then eight months later the dental surgeon drilled to place the post on the left side. While he was drilling, the shooting pain started and was immediately a ten (despite 10 to 15 shots of Novocain). It felt like my head was in a vice, almost unbearable. There was no pain at all, during or since, for the two posts on the right. While working on my right side, his assistant called his attention back to the left side, and he returned to my left side shoving the post so hard he almost shoved me out of my chair. When finished, he stitched both sides and didn’t request a return visit.\n\n\n\nSince that day the excruciating pain has only slightly diminished on the left side. Occasionally it will ease for a few minutes, or if I apply slight pressure with my finger on my left nostril the pain subsides, sometimes immediately. OTC painkillers dull pain temporarily; prescription painkillers make me feel unwell.\n\n\n\nThe pain is dramatically affecting my life. Typically a high-energy person, I now feel chronically tired. At night I press on my nose to go to sleep, but when I rise from a lying position, it comes right back and is constant throughout the day.\n\n\n\nCan the dental implant surgery be reversed? Left-side post removed and the jaw allowed to heal? Is there any procedure that can relieve this pain? Dr M: Good day\n\nIt is very strange that the dentist didn't arrange a follow-up visit. Was this someone who was experienced with the placement of implants?\nImplant surgery should only be done with proper planning and training, since a lot can go wrong.\nThere are important anatomical structures such as maxillary sinuses, as well as nerves, that could get damaged with implant placement. It could be that he accidentally damaged a nerve during the surgery.\nI would arrange a follow-up visit with him or an oral surgeon, so that this pain can be evaluated. The oral surgeon will then decide if it is necessary to remove the implant screw.\nThis can be done, and the jaw can be allowed to heal, but if there was any nerve damage, this could be transient or permanent and if you wish to place another implant at a later stage, additional bone grafting might be required. CraigPhillips: I did return to the dental surgeon who performed my surgery and he informed me that he had performed something like 1,700 dental implant surgeries prior to mine, and there had not been a single complaint. Dr M: I would then seek a second opinion from another oral surgeon. 1700 implant placements without any complaints, seems unlikely. You will always run in to complications sooner or later, no matter how experienced you are."

About 7 yrs ago i did try to get implant, my periodontist performed bonegraft n 1 yr later when i was supposed to get implant, she found out my body didn’t take in all the bonegraft n not enough bone to put the implant so she did another bonegraft, which 2-3 months later after my second bonegraft,  it got infected so i had to remove the bonegraft, then I decided to just get Maryland bridge instead of trying to get another bonegraft. \n\nBut now my Maryland bridge started to get lose so i’m considering to get an implant again. Recently, I went to 2 diff dentists for consultation, both are well respected dentist around my area. 1st i went to oral surgeon, he took 3d scan, ct scan after he looked at them he think implant is not an option considering how much bone i had lost, n the area where the implant supposed to go is really narrow, hard to do bonegraft , he told me to stick with Maryland bridge\n\nThen i Went to get second opinion from a periodontist, after reviewing the ct scan taken from previous oral surgeon office, he told me , there’s a lot of bone lost but he sure he can do the implant but he has to open up the area to decide whether to do implant n bond graft at the same time or do bonegraft first then after it heal, do the implant.  When i asked him,  What happened if it failed agaim. But he is very confident it won’t. \n\nBtw my first n second bonegraft was using xenograft . This time the perio will use allograft.

Should i get third opinion? But should i go to\nOral surgeon or periodontist.\n\nThank you for reading this long pathetic dental story of mine. Dr M: Good day\n\nFirstly both specialists deal with the placement of implants. Periodontist are however more specialized with regards to peri-implant tissues, such as gum level, emergence profile, grafting etc.\nTo understand rejection, you have to understand the definition of the previous graft you received.\nXenograft-usually from a different species, such as bovine or porcine.\nAllograft-bone from a deceased donor or cadaver that has been cleaned and stored\n\nIt is possible to rather reject xenografts than allografts, although the success of the grafting procedure is dependant on a host of factors, including patient immune status, medication use, oral hygiene, home-care, clinician skill and surgical technique.\nThat being said, it is not say the second grafting procedure won't be successful. \nAs long as you understand all procedures have their risks."

There is a dent at the sight of extraction as well as a droopy look relative to the strong, bold and defined right side. This is really depressing me. I did a bridge with a bone graft. Inside my mouth I can see gum recession in that area. I am thinking of getting an implant because I'm worried this will just keep getting worse. Is it typical for exterior facial profile to change after such a procedure? Is there anything I can do about it? I'm willing to do anything to get my face back :/ honestdoc: First molars are very traumatic to remove because of their size and anatomically flared roots.  Once it is removed, the area loses a lot of bone and will continue to lose bone through time.  Implants are a better option because it helps retain bone.  Keeping bone will help with facial profile. troubledsoul: Hello and thank you\nWhat did you mean by anatomically flared roots?\nAlso what is ridge augmentation? honestdoc: troubledsoul said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHello and thank you\nWhat did you mean by anatomically flared roots?\nAlso what is ridge augmentation?\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nFlared roots means the molar roots are more angled at different directions.   Ridge augmentation is to rebuild the bone with bone grafting material."

    "title": "Extraction, should I be concerned?",
    "dialogue": "DF-Mark: I am in a situation where I am pretty much forced to have a tooth extracted.\nThe tooth (36 Canadian) had a root canal more than 20 years ago.\n\nI pulled the crown off the tooth a little more than a year ago while flossing.\nIt was the second time the crown had come off and this time my dentist\ntold me he couldn't replace it.\n\nFrom the start (when the root canal was done) the endodontist had filed the tooth way down to little\nmore than a tiny stump, just coming above the gum line.\nNow with all the time that has gone by the tooth has decayed to where it is barely visible and sits below \nthe gum line.\n\nI have an appointment with my dentist to extract the tooth on Tuesday but am a little concerned as\na layman. I have two concerns.\nThe tooth cannot be gripped unless some digging is done between the tooth and the gums.\nSince the tooth has been without a nerve for such a long time I'm, concerned that it may break\nduring the extraction. I believe there are four chambers.\n\nMy dentist tried to re-assure me last visit by saying all should be OK and even if it were to break\nhe could leave the piece there if it was small and couldn't be accessed!\n\nA year ago, when I first started getting opinions on this tooth, another dentist was also prepared to\nextract it and had no concerns about doing the work.\n\nShould I have concerns, or should this be routine? Any advice? honestdoc: I will agree with your dentist.  The body has great potential to heal and to exfoliate unwanted material (leftover teeth).  Your dentist will use a small dental surgical elevator and gently ease the pieces out.  I am also concerned with the deteriorated tooth in front.  That tooth has poor prognosis for restoration (crown).  Make sure you get regular dental visits and minimize teeth deterioration through good oral hygiene, decreased sugary/acidic/creamy beverages like soda, Starbucks, Energy drinks, etc. and good Fluoride therapy. DF-Mark: Thanks for your reply honestdoc!\n\nI have one more question. The plan for this tooth is to extract it and then wait a couple of months before an implant is done.\nIs this standard dental procedure?\n\nI ask because I have a Russian friend who knows many people there who get there teeth removed and then have an\nimplant done in the same session, same day!\n\nWhat are the pros/cons of each method? MattKW: Agree with honestdoc. The extraction shouldn't be too hard, and I would have that out within a 30min appt. If you are thinking of implants, then I would advise you extract the one in front as well - it has a poor risk of lasting too long even with a crown. Then you would get 2 implants. \nImmediate implants are possible in carefully considered cases. Usually for front teeth where appearances are more concerning. It is less risky to do it over a period of time: extract, allow healing, then place implants, allow healing, then crown. DF-Mark: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAgree with honestdoc.

Around ten years ago I visited another dentist and had fillings done on around five teeth.\nThe next day (for the first time in my life) I slept almost non-stop for 30 hours !!!\nI just got up to go to the bathroom and then went back to sleep!\n\nNothing else had occurred at the time. I wasn't sick. I wasn't taking any drugs or alcohol etc., no food poisoning, no stress\nor other extraneous factors....\n\nWhen my dentist was finished with the three fillings I asked him some questions about the extraction.\nThen came the second big surprise of the day. He said he'd probably need to do a bone graft and started\ntalking about possibly using pig bone! He said he could use grafts from other animals or possibly a synthetic graft.\n\nAt the end of the day, it was clear that he wouldn't be doing the extraction that day! Third surprise! \nHe said he needed to get the graft material before the extraction was done.\nSo an appointment was booked for two weeks later (Jan. 20).\n\nWell I am putting the brakes on until I am fully briefed about everything, all possibilities etc.\nMy dentist first started talking about this extraction more than a year ago. He never talked about a bone graft until\nlast visit.\n\nI hope you folks can give me a quick course on extractions and implants.\n\nHere are my main questions right now:\n\n1. Why are these two procedures (extraction/implant) included in your Oral Surgery section, when there are two dentists \n   I visited (who are not surgeons) who are prepared to do the work?\n\n2. How often are bone grafts done for an extraction/implant? My mother has had five or so dental implants and never had \n    a bone graft done.\n\n3. What is the purpose for the grafts and what material is usually used?  Do they remain in the gums?\n\n    Thanks in advance! MattKW: 1. Implant surgery can be legally done by a general dentist, oral surgeon, or periodontist. Altho I've had training in a number of implant courses, I prefer to let my periodontist do the surgery because often the patient needs some touch-up periodontal therapy on the side. Also, a peridontist is better in my opinion than an oral surgeon to handle bone and gum grafting if required. A competent general dentist can do implant surgery and grafting if they have the experience.\n2. and 3. Grafting  might be actual harvested bone, synthetic or bovine bone, or GTR (guided tissue regeneration. For places where there is either not enough bone for the implant to take hold (or needs supplementation), or for front implants to plump out the gum. Most grafting if for front teeth and upper molar teeth (sinus lifting). It becomes part of your body. See part 2. here.\nSometimes the decision for grafting is made before extractions and done at the same time; sometimes it is done after the extraction wound has healed.

I first noticed this around three years ago but was told by docs etc its nothing to worry about etc. It causes me no pain and never has done apart from giving me anxiety.\nHowever i have forgotten about it for the last three years and decided to check after such a long time and its still there! I have got no where with the nhs. Your opinions will be much appreciated. I would like to add in the morning the lesion is always less pronounced and covered in a white coating which just scrapes off with this redness.  The first pic is how it looked 3 years ago and others are now. honestdoc: I can't diagnose it only from the image.  I can't explain why you had it for 3 years.  It appears like an autoimmune response where your body is attacking itself.  If it is, the lesion will respond to corticosteroids.  Related to it is a response to medication/substance such as new toothpaste, mouth rinse, herbal supplements, cinnamon products, etc.  Very rare could it be a sinister lesion such as cancer.  The only way to diagnose it is to obtain a tissue sample and examine it under a microscope (biopsy).  Is it worth undergoing such an invasive procedure?  If any images such as CT scan shows any expansion of the lesion, then it is definitely needed ASAP.  If you can identify source(s) of autoimmune responses then you save yourself a lot of trouble and trauma."

They're not very painful now at all and the only difficult thing at the moment is cleaning them. I just hope I'm doing a well enough job. I've managed this far with no infection fingers crossed. My dentist said they don't remove them unless I've had 2 infections which I'm pretty annoyed about. Is it possible that they'll be okay and the right side will straighten up abit? She said there isn't enough room for them and they might misalign my bottom teeth a bit but I can get retainers if so. I don't know what to do, I can't live off mashed potato all my life and I can't live in fear waiting for an infection. honestdoc: Get another opinion and a referral to an Oral Surgeon. MattKW: Are you in the UK? They follow the NICE Guidelines there which are IMHO too conservative about wisdom teeth. They won't misalign your lower front teeth (a myth), so no need to get retainers. Get them out if you can somewhere else."

Don't wait for the stitches to fall out. Dr M: Keep the movements gentle for the first few days. You don't want to be too rough, so that you cause the stitches to tear open. robnav: Thank you for your response. I have been doing the exercises. When I do the one that you pull your tongue to the wall of your upper mouth I get this really bad pain in my right ear. I’m assuming this is not normal. Sometimes I feel a discomfort in the left ear but it’s actual pain in the right ear.\n\nI know you can’t tell me without an examination but could a frenectomy cause an ear infection?

    "dialogue": "Mae: Needing a second opinion:\n\nAbout 2 years ago my 11 year old daughter had an accident and her front top tooth fell out.\n\nThe dentist managed to put it back in and overall its been fine since.\n\nBut because the nerves on the root were dead and they cleaned them off that means that basically the tooth is dead and won't grow with the rest of the teeth and jaw.\n\nBecause of that the dentist advised that now they cut her tooth all the way up to the gum (while leaving the root inside) and have my daughter wear a flipper tooth instead until she is old enough to have an implant.\n\nThey said that if we leave this tooth as it is now, if we leave it like this until she is old enough for an implant then while the rest of her teeth and jaw grows, this dead tooth including its gum will stay up and will look very disproportionate from the rest of her teeth and then when it's time for an implant it will be a very complicated and dangerous process.\n\nLast week we had the impressions done and next week she is due for the surgery to have her tooth cut while leaving her dead root in and she will have her first encounter with her flipper tooth that she will have to wear until she is old enough for an implant.\n\nI would like to know if there is another option for her? I am very relactant of her having this surgery as well having her wear a flipper for the next 10 years at least.\n\nAlso I don't understand how leaving the whole tooth on as is now until old enough for an implant will be very complicated and dangerous then but that won't be the case if they cut the tooth now while leaving the dead root in now and having a flipper in as they plan to do?\n\nAlso how cutting the tooth now while leaving the dead root in won't have the consequences of it and it's gum being disproportionate with the growth as it would apparently be if they leave the tooth in? honestdoc: This doesn't make sense that the dentist has to cut the tooth.  Was there a fracture that separated the tooth (crown) from the root?  Of course the tooth will be dead because the nerve lost its blood supply.  Here in the US, we will do the root canal to clean all the dead nerves and seal it from getting any infection.  We try to preserve the tooth as long as possible since the child is still developing and removing the tooth will collapse the developing bone causing some malformation of the facial profile.  We would splint the tooth to allow for bone to tighten around the root.  Cutting the tooth would be the last resort if there was too much damage.  Once the bone is fully developed around 19 years or older, implant would be more predictable. Mae: Honestdoc, thank you so much for your reply.\n\nThere was no fracture that seperated the tooth(crown) from the root. \n\nAnd just to add it is the top central incisor tooth.\n\nThe trauma and replantation of the tooth happened 2 years ago. The trauma occured in the evening and the replantation the following morning. At the time I believe the dentist did a root canal to clean all the dead nerves and seal it from getting any infection, trying to perserve the tooth for as long as possible. Also about few days later or so, the dentist put a metal splint which my daughter wore for about a week which was a but painful.\n\nAt the beginning of this year the little filling at the back of the tooth fell out and she developed an infection which was treated. The dentist cleaned it up inside with a thin tube and sealed the tooth again.\n\n\nBut even when they replanted the tooth at the time 2 years ago they said that at one point the tooth(crown) would need to be cut all the way to the gumline, while leaving the root inside and a flipper will need to be worn until later when my daughter is in her 20's when she would be able to get an implant. \n\nThe main reason from what I understood that that needs to happen is to make sure that there is enough bone for the future implant. Otherwise if the tooth is left as is apparently the tooth will become smaller then the rest of the teeth, the gum would pull back in developing an uneven gumline and bone loss will occur which all will be a problem for a future implant. That os what I understood from what the dentist explained. I remember the dentist saying that in that case the future implant would be more complicated as they would have to build on more bone so that the future implant can take hold. Also I was told that the reason this tooth will remain smaller then the rest and the gumline would be pulled in is because the remaining of the teeth and gum would grow as she grows while that tooth will stay the same size which would result in a uneven tooth line and gumline.\n\nWhat I don't understand is how now cutting the crown from the root and leaving the root inside helps no bone to be lost and that can't be the case leaving the crown to the root as it is now.\n\nAnd just wanted to find out if there was another option so she doesn't have to go through this surgery and loose the crown which all seems good like this and to have to wear a flipper for at least 10 years which is a very long time for a annoying temporary solution that would also need adjustments along the way. MattKW: replanted teeth have a poor success rate by 5 years. Often the root becomes eaten away (like a baby tooth) and replaced by bone. So, unless your child is having pain or infection, I'd suggest leaving it alone and simply X-raying it annually."

    "title": "Impacted Wisdom Teeth",
    "dialogue": "Mike09: I had a panoramic X-ray done a week ago.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the two lower wisdom teeth are problematic. They sometimes cause bleeding.\nThe dentist who took the photo said that I don't need to get them removed as long as I clean them properly and that there is a high risk of alveolar nerve damage from the extraction. She offered treatment for periodontal disease instead, and it includes root scaling, laser sessions, and injectable stem cells. \n\nSince then I asked a few dentists online and they all said that the teeth should be removed. One of them explained that the lower wisdom tooth on the left (right on the picture) has already caused significant bone loss and its roots are not close to the alveolar nerve so it should be extracted as soon as possible. The right one (left on the picture) on the other hand, might be risky to extract and the surgeon might want to take CBCT to see where the nerve passes.\n\nI have an appointment with another dentist tomorrow and she will probably recommend an oral surgeon.\nI am worried that the surgeon might suggest extraction regardless of how risky it might be.\n\nSo here are my questions:\n1) Do you think that both teeth should be extracted or do you think that both (or one of them) could be left and it/they wouldn't cause serious issues in the future?\n2) How risky is the extraction of each one of them, in your opinion?\n3) Is the extraction currently more urgent than the periodontal disease treatment offered by my dentist?\n4) How much can the extractions and the periodontal disease treatment be postponed without developing serious problems? Both procedures are very expensive and I will have to choose one of them and put off the other one.\n5) What could happen if the wisdom teeth are not extracted? Could this lead to a jaw infection? How would it be treated?\n6) What would happen if the alveolar nerve is damaged during the surgery? And would it require expensive treatment afterwards (which I probably wouldn't be able to afford)? Dr M: Good day\n\n1) Yes both teeth needs removal, since the bone loss can affect the teeth adjacent to them and lead to further problems. Impacted 3rd molars can also lead to dentigerous cysts and then this can also affect the adjacent teeth. If they are partially erupted in the mouth, they can lead to continuous episodes of pericoronitis, which is very painful and also lead to abscesses.\n\n2) Both of the teeth appear to be in close proximity to the nerve. This is a 2 dimensional image however. An oral surgeon can take a 3 dimensional scan that can give a better evaluation.\n\n3) I would prioritize the extractions and then continue with periodontal treatment afterwards.\n\n4) It all depends. Everyone is different and an exact timeline can't be given. Based on the amount of bone loss, I would not wait too long and definitely would prioritize the extractions.\n\n5) If the teeth are not extracted, it could lead to cyst formation or additional bone loss, affecting the adjacent teeth, which might be lost as well, with or without additional bone loss of the cysts have to undergo additional debridement. Abscess formation is also a possibility and this infection could spread to additional spaces in the face, and can become life threatening if left untreated.\n\n6)  If the nerve gets damaged, it all depends on the type of damage. If the nerve is completely severed, you could lose all sensation on the affected lower side from the back up until the front, with possible neuropathic pain. If the nerve is only bruised, the numbing sensation could be prolonged for a period from a few days up until a few months/years and then gradually return to normal. This can also be accompanied by neuropathic pain such as a burning or tingling pain.\nUsually the symptoms area treated with medications, and there have been some new studies done on laser therapies and Vitamins that can speed along nerve regeneration, but in my experience thus far, the main thing is to watch and wait and be patient.\n\nHope this answers some questions.

No dentist has suggested that, I just came up with it the other day, so it's probably nonsense.\n\nAlso, how common is it for the wisdom teeth to be in close proximity to the nerve? And how common is it for such nerve damage to occur during extraction in cases similar to mine? I would like to have a better idea of the risk of removing the teeth vs. the risk of not removing them. Does the risk-reward ratio in a case like mine seem like a no brainer to a dentist like you? I am somewhat worried that when I go to an oral surgeon he will suggest extraction anyway, since it's his job and he will get very good money for it (especially considering the crisis that we are living in right now). So I'm not sure how objective his/her opinion would be in this case. I hope you don't find this offensive as a dental professional. Dr M: An oral surgeon will definitely suggest extraction. An experienced oral surgeon can remove these teeth without any complications. I have seen a lot worse impacted molars than the ones you have. 90% of them were removed without any complications, and permanent nerve damage is rare.\nAlso remember that the image you have is 2 dimensional. In reality there might not be any nerve involvement. There are certain signs that we look for when evaluating risk of nerve involvement on a panoramic x-ray. And it doesn't look like you have many, so it might be that the nerve is not involved, in my opinion.\nIt would also be best to keep the adjacent teeth and remove the wisdoms. You will have to have some sort of periodontal treatment afterwards, to attend to the bone loss surrounding the adjacent molars, but this can be postponed for a while if money is an issue.

I saw some 2 hard bump on the gum of the extraction site in August and it was so tiny and hard. I went back and asked the surgeon.  He said it will absorb on it's own and it will take time. Told me to come back after 2 weeks. I didn't go back and was waiting to see if t goes away on its own. It started giving me sharp pain and pinching like pain for last 2 weeks. Went back today and he shaved it off. He said it's a bone and it was a bone that emerges like 2 bump. He put anesthesia and shaved it off and dod stitches. I didn't have stitches for the tooth extraction. I had stitches today and he said it will dissolve on it's own. How to know if it will dissolve? I never had stitches before. Whether will I be able to see the area and identify if stiches present or not. How to know that if stich dissolve on it's own . Can I eat normally? How long does it take to heal from that?will stich go on it's own?\nDo we need to follow the same post op instructions as wisdom tooth removal? Anyone did this bone shaving earlier?\nEven though they numbed me during the procedure, I could feel the pressure they used to shave it down. It was so hard and pressurized. He did stiches after that. When can I eat normally?\n\nI wanted to ask these questions to the surgeon. He did the stiches and told me to take motrin OTC and left the room.

My dentist used something to plug the hole to help with healing and ease the pain I was having. It's been 3 days since then and now I'm having sinus effects. The stuff he used tasted/smelled gross but I worked though it but now it seems to be in my sinus?? I blew my nose and the stuff that came out smelled bad as well. Did I unintentionally suck the stuff he used into my sinuses? Is that possible?\n\nI'm attaching my xray of tooth prior to removal because the root seems to go beyond the bone and they didn't seem to do anything special when taking it out (I wasn't even put under, just had laughing gas). I'm probably being paranoid but I'd really like what another dentist may think. Thanks for listening. honestdoc: The top right wisdom tooth was very close to the sinus.  The membrane separating the sinus is very thin and could easily be perforated.  If the socket is closed, there is good chance the membrane will close up.  Get a follow up to check for closure and avoid blowing your nose to minimize disturbing the healing process."

I have been advised to have it removed asap, but I would like to do so back home and therefore to wait for at least a month since I cannot fly anytime soon because of work commitments. Pain is not an issue so far, I'm just wondering whether there may be other complications if I choose to wait. What would you advise? \nPS: The treated molar close-by has a temporary crown, and I am planning to replace that with a permanent one pretty much at the same time. You can advise me whether that's a good idea or not. Thank you. honestdoc: This wisdom tooth is a high risk for injury case.  The tooth is distally impacted (tipped away from the midline) which the path of exit is towards your throat where there is no space.  The most scary is the close proximity to the Inferior Alveolar (IA) nerve which if damaged, could make your Lower Right lip numb (maybe permanently).  What can make it easier is the fused root anatomy which can help roll the tooth out in one piece.  I would only have the Oral Surgeon evaluate it.  In the mean time, have the dentist prescribe you Peridex 0.12% (non-alcohol base to minimize chemical irritation) and rinse for 2 to 4 weeks (not longer because you risk darkening your teeth) and get the temp crown taken care of. Alina D: Thank you so much for your reply. I will follow your advice and go to an oral surgeon to evaluate it. \nIf I'll there will be pain, I will not wait 4 more weeks and I'll get it removed as soon as possible. Have a great day."

I have seen two dentists; one told me that if I have it pulled, the other teeth will start coming out.

It is a problem of expense, and I want immediate relief. Dr M: Good day\n\nAn implant can be placed at a later stage depending on the bone quality and space between planned implant and adjacent structures. Some specialists advise to wait 3 to 6 months to allow bone healing to take place. If there was infection, then you have to wait a bit longer. Bill54: Thank you for your reply, Dr. M. May I ask one more question?\nA dentist told me I would need a guided tissue regeneration and bone graft after extraction (immediately, I gather) to preserve the bone structure. This would be quite expensive.  Is an immediate bone graft, etc. really necessary?  I just want to have the tooth pulled; it is slow torture. Dr M: Good day\n\nIt all depends on the extraction procedure. If it is a difficult extraction with more than normal bone loss, and there was not much bone to begin with, then this might be necessary."

Dentist agreed but then she drilled three holes.\nAll three holes are in front close to each other, none in the back.\nBesides the limited load distribution problem, my main concern is the torque on the stents.\nIf my molars bite on something hard, cantilever action with about 30 to 40 mm lever arm causes high torque at the point of the stents. I am afraid, this could break the yaw bone. \nIs there a reason not to put two stents in the back close to the molars to eliminate the problem?\nPlease advise   -   Thanks Dr M: Good day\n\nIs there enough bone present posteriorly? Sometimes the availability of sound bone as well as the proximity to other vital structures can influence the decision to position implants. Henry O: Dentist mentioned something about not enough bone.  \nBut, will it break??? honestdoc: Where did you get the implants placed?  Did a surgeon or general dentist place it?  The upper posterior bone usually is thinner under the sinus cavity.  Usually the surgeon may recommend lifting the sinus to allow more bone grafting to place implants.  Without posterior implants, your denture may not be as stable and retentive.\n\nWith the cantilever action, most likely your bone won't break but it won't osteointegrate (heal) around the implants causing the implants to be loose and fail.  I always recommend an experienced surgical team as well as restorative team for implants. Henry O: It was a general Dentist.  So far, only holes are drilled, no implants yet.\nHealing ... that's another point, the bone integration might suffer due to constant wiggle. Dr M: I agree with honestdoc. \nUsually a surgical team with proper planning is needed.\nIt is also strange that the dentist only drilled holes without at least placing the implant screws. Usually this is done and then they are covered by healing abutments if immediate loading was not planned, in order to allow osseo-intergration to take place. \nThis does sound like a strange protocol to me.\nAs honestdoc said, if the implants aren't positioned properly to allow for the various forces that are going to influence them, the implants will ultimately become loose and then fail.\nIt sounds like the general dentist might have realised that the positioning was not planned properly and then aborted placing the implants.\nI would consider getting the procedure done by someone that is experienced in implant placement as well as the subsequent restoration. \nAfter all-you are paying a lot of $. Henry O: I could be wrong about the sockets. Maybe they have been placed. But they are not visible. \nIn the lower yaw I got two implants at the same time, there the metal (stents) is visible.\n\nI was thinking, if the denture would be on a ball joint or stents that are slightly flexible in the \nforward-backward plane, the problem might be reduced or eliminated. Henry O: Update:\n\nThe sockets were placed. They were not visible in the mouth with a mirror, but X-ray showed them.\nDentist acknowledged my concern with cantilever torque but showed 3D X-ray that there is very little bone under a big sinus cavity.\n\nCan the bone mass be increased? honestdoc: Sinus lift surgery usually done by oral surgeon or periodontist. Dr M: Yes, sinus lift surgery with or without additional bone augmentation, but this does increase the overall treatment time."

Make sure you don't have any nasal or sinus problems because the root tips situate very close to the thin sinus membrane.  Your healing in the pictures look good.

Dr M: Good day\n\nThe bur that is used, is a sterile bur. So in theory it should be clean, and if it remains in the position, and healing is normal, it could stay there without any problems. Or push itself out.\nFollow the advice of the specialist, and go for your regular check-ups, where the position of the bur can be determined with a x-ray.\nIf you feel any pain in the area, or notice any swelling, it is important to go back to the specialist.\nSometimes the bur moves over a period of years, to such a position where it can be safely removed, without nerve damage. Dr M: The foreign body i.e bur could be enclosed by a capsule of granulation tissue, and be left for years. There has been minimal reported cases like this. The important thing is regular follow-up, to observe the fragment and to prevent it from moving into other anatomical spaces.

The bleeding should become less and less during the day, with minimal if no bleeding the next day. The pressure of the denture on the sockets helps to facilitate the bleeding to stop.

I'm not seeing much swelling.  The color changes are normal.  It represents the formation of epithelial repair tissue and will soon close up.  Lower 2nd molars can be difficult to remove due to the thick, dense jaw bone locking in the varying root anatomies (multiple divergent and curved roots).  The mouth has good healing potential so it is fairly rare to experience complications unless you smoke and or have medical conditions like diabetes.

    "title": "Apicoectomy teeth #s 23, 24, 25, 26 with bone graft",
    "dialogue": "Gental: Hello, (see before and after images)\n\nI had apicoectomys (apicoectomies?) done on my front 4 bottom teeth.  I was under the impression that only the bottom 2 to 3mms of my teeth were going to be removed.  I asked to see the after x-ray and I was surprised at how much tooth looks like was removed.  Is it me or was a lot of tooth removed?  Could someone explain if this just looks like a lot or hopefully there is some kind of reason this much had to be removed due to infection?  I thought that the teeth were exposed, the very tips of the teeth were removed, and then as much infected bone and tissue needed to be removed would be removed, just a little surprised at how much actual tooth was removed.\n\nI am a little concerned about if what is left of the teeth go down far enough to be sturdy long term?  If my bone graft turns to real solid bone well, should they be strong?  Hopefully my bone graft heals well, I did have a bit of a set back with wound dehiscence unfortunately, which is now healing through secondary intention.  Right now the hole is just 2mm I think and is healing.  The dentists/students? that have seen me on follow ups think that the bone graft should be fine and I am staying on the chlorhexidine until it fully closes.\n\nI am reaching out on this forum because I have some questions but it is really hard to get questions answered at this residency clinic.  They didn't really tell me all the info I should have known beforehand and I haven't seen the doctor who actually did my work after the surgery.  Thanks for your time everyone, appreciate it. Dr M: Good day\n\nFirstly, it is important to note that this x-ray is 2 dimensional. Usually a tooth is also sectioned at the tip at an angle, so this x-ray might give you a misinterpretation of how much tooth was actually removed.\nSecondly, as much tooth, bone and granulation tissue needs to be removed in order to facilitate healing. The ideal crown ( top part of tooth ) and root ratio is 1/3 to 2/3's. Or at the very least 50/50. \nJudging from your x-ray and counting in the fact that you have a graft, the stability should be fine.\nThe tooth with the post and crown is a bit more of a worry, since the seal on the root end part might not be that good and could lead to failure.\nIt is also important to keep in mind that root canal treated teeth, with apicetomies, is no guarantee that the teeth will be fine in the long term.\nThere is always a chance that this could also fail, and then you will end up loosing the teeth, which would lead to either a partial denture, or implants as solutions.\n\nHope this helps. Gental: Hi, yes that all makes sense, thanks for your reply.  I agree about the crowned tooth, it was done by my hometown dentist and he did a great job so we have to just hope.  And for the longevity of the apicoectomy as well, just hope I am a long term outcome, there must be some cases where they last impressively long.\n\nAbout the wound  dehiscence, it was not across the entire length of the opening and is now down to 2mm or less.  Basically my question is can you have dehiscence in part of the wound and it not affect the bone graft?  I am not showing any signs of infection.  Just a little worried that maybe the wound closes but somehow the bone graft was compromised while the dehiscenced part was closing up.\n\nThanks again Dr M: There is a risk, but it may be relatively small, depending on if the area was treated appropriately. My advice would be to watch and wait and to go for your scheduled follow up visits to confirm new bone formation in the graft area.\nIt is a good sign that everything is healing. Gental: Great, will do. Thanks for your time. Gental: Hi Again. I was wondering as well.  Could you tell from the X-ray if the surgeon  put a root end filling at the bottoms of the teeth? I am curious if this was done and I can not tell from the image and I asked the helpers to ask the surgeon and they said they’d get back to me but no one has told me. MattKW: Sorry, but those are pretty rough apicos which I would expect to fail within 12-18 moths, either from reinfection or fractures. They appear to have been done by an oral surgeon and not an endodontist. There has not been much regard for the quality of the underlying RCTs which are of so-so quality. Normally an endodontist would try redoing the RCTs, and use apicos as a secondary intervention. Gental: I would have rather had the roots retreated. When I went to the clinic I purposefully went on the one day a week that the endodontist is in.  At first she said to try a root canal re-treatment of 2 of the teeth but then looked over it all for awhile and said that with the bone loss in the jaw that it is better to get in there and remove it all along with a bone graft.  They made it seem that just root canal re-treatment would not completely solve the jaw bone infection, could re-treatments have cleared all the infection away?\n\nHonestly I would have gotten a second opinion if I was aware of how significant apicoectomies are, they really made them seem like a very minor thing where the very very tip of the root is taken, and when I looked them up a bit on the web, everywhere seems to also make it look like this tiny bit of the apex is taken.  But after having them and I watched an actual surgery video, it really is not that small of a thing.\n\nAs for the original root canals, I got them done in 2004/2005 when I was 17/18 after a basketball injury sent all 4 of them straight backwards from an elbow.  I had no problems with them until around 2015 when I got a basketball shoulder that shattered the one that then got a crown.  I never had any issues with those root canals until that second injury.\n\nWhen you say fracture, do you say this because of how much tooth was taken and lack of stability will lead to them fracturing with normal use?  I am a pretty healthy person, if the bone graft takes well is there a chance they can become pretty strong?  Also what is your fear of reinfection, because of not all the infection being cleared when the apicos and bone graft were done, or the wound opening?  The wound opening is nearly shut now. Dr M: Good day\n\nI agree with MattKw, that apicoectomies are usually done as second line treatment. A retreatment would have been first choice. It is possible that unfortunetly the infection was to severe, for only a retreatment to have cleared it up, and therefore apicoectomies might have been needed. Even with a retreatment, there is a chance that all the granulation tissue and infected bone, could result in the retreatment failing, or the teeth that are being retreated could end up fracturing during the retreatment process or the end result could have been similar with similar quality root canals. There are unfortunately a lot of possible outcomes, but at this stage it is too late to reminisce over what could have been done. The infection should have been picked up initially during check-up visits, before it got to such a severe stage.\nLike I explained in my previous post, the root-crown ratio is a bit compromised now, and since these teeth are root canal treated, they might end up fracturing at a later stage. \nIn my personal experience it won't last you the rest of your life. You can consider crowning the remaining teeth, in order to prevent them from fracturing, but this should only be consider once the apicoectomies and bone graft have been deemed successful and there is no longer residual infection at the site. Crowns might increase the strength of the teeth.\nIf the roots fracture, because of weakened structural stability after the apicoectomies, then unfortunately they will have to be removed. Gental: Thanks for both your time. Yes I wish I had at least once paid out of pocket to see my hometown dentist during this span of not having insurance/funds. I went to a few dentists that took my crappy insurance and asked them about the teeth and they were not concerned but my gut said that the darkness there was not normal.  But you are right, you can't go back in time...\n\nJust hope these last long enough for me to move up in my career and them not be so daunting to address financially, because everything is times 4.  If/when... they fail, I hope that at least I can get an implant supported bridge, but would rather 4 implants.  Though one dentist seemed like I could get 4 implants and another acted like there was not enough space.  Would 4 implants be an option and if I got another bone graft and they were done by a good dentist could those last a real long time?\n\nThanks for the advice on maybe getting crowns for them, part of me feels like maybe just saving up for implants in the future.  One dentist said that after the apicos I could get a special bridge made for support which confused me.  I said I thought bridges are for missing teeth and that I was confused and he did not explain further.  I am guessing like some kind of cap thing that would span the 4 hurt teeth and 2 neighboring teeth, which I don't really want to bother the neighboring teeth that are healthy.\n\nThanks again, appreciate the responses MattKW: Once the integrity of the tips are removed like yours have been, then the root as a whole is weakened, and that leads to fractures. I would not advise crowns; it would be a waste of money. You would be better saving up for implants. You don't need an implant for each lost tooth; 2 implants would suffice to hold up a 4-unit bridge. Dr M: Agree with MattKW. In terms of a long term solution, implants will be the best option. Gental: I understand what you both are saying, though I still do not get why so much of the root tips were removed by the oral surgeon.  If you have the window open why couldn't you scrape away the infected jaw bone and you should have visibility to take a smaller amount of the tips.  Especially hearing that this is pretty important to long term outcome.\n\nAs for the implants, why is it not more advisable to get 4 implants?  From everything I hear it seems like implants can last a really long time with proper care, they take up the socket space and keep the gums and bone from shrinking etc.  The process of cleaning them is more straight forward and like regular teeth.  Then you have the bridge, sure it is in implants so not affecting the natural teeth, but from what I have gathered, the bridge part needs to be replaced on average sooner than an individual implant would, there can be bone/gum loss going on underneath the bridge, and cleaning under them seems a bit less straightforward with possible issues arising.  Not to mention maybe getting something stuck under by accident and pulling on the unit.\n\nSo why do dentists say a bridge.  Is it that there is legit not enough space there?  I don't care if it is a bit more expensive with more steps, is it just easier? Dr M: Usually price is an issue. Most people can't afford 4 implants. There is also the issue of the amount of space needed between implants. Usually about 2.5-3mm of bone needs to be present between implants. In such as a case it is possible that 4 implants will not fit in the available space.\nWith good maintenance it is possible that the bridge components could also last a very long time before they need replacement. \n\nWith regards to the apicoectomies that were done...without seeing how much of infected bone was present or what the condition of the root apices were, it is difficult to say if he took too much off. Gental: I see, thanks a lot for expounding. Thank you both for your time.  Maybe I can hold out long enough for new advances in smaller but stable screws or something.  Dental needs to be part of health insurance always and not this side thing, I guess too many people are lucky and don't get elbows to the face in high school and are just ignorant to the need. Dr M: Good luck and all the best! Gental: Thank you!"

Since you have anxiety issues, you primarily need to talk about this with your general dentist. Perhaps you will find benefit with some nitrous oxide (laughing gas), or even supplement it with a short-acting benzodiazepine, e.g. triazolam (\"Halcion\").\nI'd suggest you try some of the easier extractions with these supplements, and you may build up your confidence.

    "dialogue": "John B: I am 64. After a lot of years of difficulty, my dentist has talked me into upper dentures. I have 2 upper dental implants, prior to remaining extractions. My dentist put screws, or covers in the 2 remaining implants, while he extracted all upper teeth. He said that I could decide if I want snap in upper dentures, and the 2 implants would be enough to hold them. He said I could let my gums heal for at least 6 months while I decided whether to go with 2 implants that are already there for  $2000 or use suction to hold the denture, without implants for additional $1000. Wearing the upper denture over top of the upper gums with old implants that have screws in them has been painful, and I think that the implant screw keeps the denture from seating. One implant seems quit irritated. I need to go forward with my permanent upper dentures. My beginner dentures do not fit and fall out without adhesive. I am uncomfortable at this point with the dentures in or out. I need advise as to get permanent upper dentures using my 2 current implants or  hope for a good fit and not use the implants. Can you give me advise on this irritating issue? Dr M: Good day\n\nThe beginnner dentures that you are talking about, is what we refer to as immediate dentures. They are usually placed directly after extractions. They begin to lose retention after a period of 6 months to a year, because the areas where your teeth used to be, changes shape as the bone changes dimensions.\nSometimes a reline is done, to improve the fit, but usually a new denture needs to be made ultimately.\nWithout any pictures, it is difficult to give an exact opinion, but it can be possible that the existing implants can prevent the denture from seating as it should.\nIf there is too much pressure on the implants, and one already \" looks irritated \" , I would get this looked at, because chronic inflammation can result in a condition called peri-implantitis or peri-implant mucotitis, which could ultimately lead to implant failure and loss.\n\nSince you already have 2 implants, I would suggest going for an implanted supported denture, where the denture is attached to the implants. It might be necessary for an additional implant to be placed, in order to prevent too much strain on the other implants, especially if they aren't 100%.\nYou can maybe have a consultation with a prosthodontist, in order to make sure if 2 implants are enough and if the 2 that are there, are still stable enough to support a denture?\nUltimately an implant supported denture is a lot more comfortable, since they don't \" feel loose \" in your mouth.

So now I am getting an extraction of them this week. Will this fix the problem or not? honestdoc: Without xrays and images, we don't know how your teeth and bite are aligned.  If it is only slightly off and you don't have crowding and lack of space, your cheek and tongue may help align your teeth (more so when your teeth are erupting).  Most likely your orthodontists will answer your question after taking records and images."

    "dialogue": "Du_deleted: Hi all,\nI am dealing with some tooth issues. Jaw pain and swelling under the ear for more than a month. Had sinus Infection and I got antibiotics for that. I thought this jaw pain and swelling is because of the sinus infection.\nThen waited for a couple of weeks and went to dentist to check that out. My regular dentist is not available and went to a new dentist. He checked the x-rays and said no infection seen on any tooth. He said, since I have taken antibiotics already, if at all any infection was there and it would have cleared up.\nHe did bite test and I felt so discomfort on one spot on lower first molar. So he told me that this tooth is causing the jaw pain and swelling under the ear. It might have a fracture. So told me to extract it as RCT will not be successful. He told me to take cbct scan and told me that he couldn't tell for sure there is a fracture. It's not visible on the scan and it is unpredictable. I was totally shocked and I didn't have any pain on that tooth before the visit.\nThough I didn't chew much on that side, I feel so tight on all the molars that side.\n\nI went to an Endo to evaluate it. He checked through microscope and said no fracture seen. He didn't either take or see my cbct scan images. During cold spray test, I felt very sensitive on that tooth than other ones. And felt pain and sensitivity to bite on one spot on that tooth during bite test. So, he said might be minor crack and I can get a crown. I told them it's throbbing pain in the jaw while lying down and during the day. He was not sure if the jaw pain and swelling is because of the minor crack and told me to RCT if I cannot bare the pain. I don't know if I can go for RCT for the jaw pain.\n\nAgain not a definitive answer and clueless. Been through the same pain and swelling for more than a month. My quality of life is gone really bad. Went to an oral surgeon to check my upper wisdom tooth. I have removed my lower wisdom tooth 19yrs back.\n\nI went to the Oral surgeon on Friday and he said my jaw pain and swelling is because of the erupted upper wisdom tooth and told me to extract it. Prescribed robaxin, valium, ibprufen 800 for jaw pain and inflammation.\n\nI wanted to remove it asap. Before that I am also planning to see another Endo to see if any issue on #30 tooth and that is given a first priority treatment or the upper wisdom tooth.thats really frustrating for me to not get a definitive answer been to many dental office. If that tooth need RCT or extraction, implant and I have to do that too.\n\nComing to the original query, my lower wisdom tooth has been removed with a numb shot only. Not anesthesia stuff.\n\nHave you used general or local anesthesia for your wisdom tooth removal? If so, how many tooth removal in a visit? All 4? I have 2 upper wisdom tooth left. The oral surgeon if I have to be awake or sleep for the surgery? I said I have to be awake since it's pandemic time. To be honest, I don't know the difference between the 2 anesthesia for wisdom tooth removal.\n\nIf I planned to remove those 2 WT in the same spot, do I need general anesthesia? As if now, I want to remove only one on right side as that s causing the pain and swelling for more than a month. Nothing helps to reduce the swelling and pain. It's still the same.\n\nDo I need to wait to go for extraction until the swelling and pain subsides??\n\nWhich anesthesia do you recommend? I am nervous about dental procedures. So, what should I chose?\n\nHow about the post op for you? How many days does it take for you to recover?\n\nThanks for reading this here. Thank you!! MattKW: Usually upper wisdoms are easily done under local anaesthetic.

I’m so sorry for the unpleasant picture Dr M: Good day,\n\nUsually a dry socket appears +- 3-5 days after an extraction. Bottom sockets are more commonly affected, because food and other particles are more likely to get stuck, because of gravity as well as other factors that play a role\nAlthough a dry socket is usually self limiting, it can be extremely painful and can also lead to infection spreading to adjacent areas.\nIt is my recommendation to rather schedule a follow-up visit with your dentist, so that the socket can be cleaned out, and most likely your dentist will then prescribe a short course of antibiotics. You can take anti-inflammatory medication in the mean time to help with the pain."

Dr M: Good day,\n\nThe technology and techniques with the placement of dental implants has improved greatly over the last few years and it is still improving today.\nIt is not to say 100% that an implant only lasts you +- 20 years. There are a lot of factors that play a role, including your own personal oral hygiene, the skill level of the surgeon that placed the implant as well as the quality of the final restoration method, to name a few.\nIt is also important to note, that the implant screw can fail over time, or the implant crown or both, so it depends on the scenario.\nOnce an implant fails, there is also a lot of treatments that can be done to try and save the implant first.\nIf it needs removal, it is also possible to replace it with another implant.\nIf additional implant surgery is required, depends on the reason for failure, the bone quality and quantity that is left, as well as other factors.\nIt is important to remember that once a implant is placed, it doesn't mean you should neglect your regular dental check-ups.

It's not always terribly important, because in the mouth there's often a hole left after the extraction, so healing by primary intention is not always possible. Therefore, healing where the edges can't be brought together and healing by secondary intention is quite common. As honestdoc says, thankfully the mouth usually heals quite well. Cambridge: I had my wisdom teeth removed Wednesday so this is the 5th day and my pain seems to have gotten worse today and my pain is radiating from my ear to my chin and my tooth extraction site itself feels like it’s throbbing. Cambridge: This is what it looks like best picture I could get honestdoc: Hopefully you can see your dentist soon.  It's hard to spot all the details but if appropriate, the dentist can apply some medicament into the socket to relieve your pain.   Lower wisdom teeth are more traumatic to remove because your lower jaw has denser bone to contend with."

    "dialogue": "storm: My concern is I need to get my two left molars extracted as they have been pestering me for a very long time now. I just found out that dental abscess can cause some serious problems like brain abscess if not treated. It's getting me all anxious. I went to a small dental clinic nearby and had my teeth checked last week. And just when I thought they could be yanked as soon as anesthesia kicked in, the dentist had to stop the procedure because I could still feel the pain when she was trying to move my molar which shouldn’t hurt considering that she'd already injected anesthesia in my gums thrice to numb them. I had also finished taking amoxicillin for 8 days but I feel like they're gonna hurt again anytime soon because of the pulse I feel. I've never had extraction before because I'm too scared so Its gonna be my first time.\n\nCould you evaluate what happened? Should I take amoxicillin for another 7 days?  Or can I just proceed with the extraction even if it still hurts a bit? She suspected that it still has pus inside my gum that's why one molar was still hurting so she prescribed another amoxicillin but I no longer want to take any antibiotics as I might get resistant. I'm planning to have an appointment again after my period. I appreciate your help. Dr M: Good day\nSometimes the bacteria that causes the pain and infection is resistant to Amoxicillin if used alone. Some bacteria are anaerobic i.e requires a different antibiotic in combination with Amoxicillin.  I usually give a dose of Flagyl or Metranidizole. You can also try this now instead of another course of Amoxicillin, since the Amoxicillin stays in your system for up to 2 weeks till a month. \nThere are some side effects with this antibiotic, such as some GI issues, which you can combat with a pro-biotic.\nSometimes the abscess can also prevent the local anaesthetic to reach maximum effectiveness, which might result in a small amount of pain.\nMy advice would be to rather remove the tooth. Without the source of infection, no further antibiotics will be needed."

My advice is to go to a dentist experienced with implants.

Immediate placement only saves the patient some time (supposedly) but introduces other risks, e.g. what if the tooth fractures during extraction, is the position of the tooth root ideal for the same position of an implant, what retention will the implant have if it isn't fully surrounded by bone?"

The infection improves sometimes and flares up at others and I have had a few antibiotic courses. I now have pain when the tooth is pressed and what is probably a sinus to the gum (some swelling near that tooth). When the tooth is extracted, will the surgeon drain the abscess under the root or will that clear by itself once the extraction is done? MattKW: By removing the tooth, the abscess is automatically drained, and it will clear up by itself and without antibiotics. It's like taking out an infected splinter of wood. Craig: But, I have seen others comment that it is possible for the infection to spread when the tooth is extracted. What is the likelihood of that? MattKW: An abscess is a collection of bacteria (alive/dead), and dead white blood cells that have been trying to fight the infection. Once you get rid of the source of infection, the body defenses will nearly always win. \nThe more often you take antibiotics while waiting for an extraction, then the more likely the bacteria will become resistant. Maybe once every 3-5 years I have sent people to hospital because the infection was too well established by the time they finally had an extraction, and they needed IV antibiotics to help. Every year, 1 person will die per population of 2 million people in a 1st World country from an uncontrollable infection, usually because they kept throwing antibiotics at it rather than get it extracted."

    "dialogue": "gradym: I’m in my late sixties. Upper right wisdom tooth was extracted approximately 27 years ago. The lower right wisdom tooth has migrated upwards about 4 millimeters because of lack of an opposing tooth.\n\nThat lower right wisdom tooth has had a series of big fillings, and they always fall out after six months to 1 year. The last time the filling fell out, I had pain and the dentist suggested extraction, but I am nervous about extraction and the possibility of permanent nerve damage, so I asked her to just fill it again. She did so, although she warned that the filling probably would not last long.\n\nThat filling has now fallen out, but there’s no pain. Maybe the nerve has died?\n\nThe dentist suggested that, if I didn’t want to extract it, the next best thing was to crown it, and also crown the tooth next to it, and then attach the crowns together. She said this attachment would prevent the 3rd molar from migrating further.\n\nI don’t really like the idea of crowning both teeth if it’s not necessary, and a few questions occur to me:\n\nAt my age, is this lower wisdom tooth really going to keep migrating if it only migrated a few millimeters in 27 years?\n\nIs it possible the wisdom tooth will migrate to the point that it self-extracts itself safely? Is it migrating away from the root, or just growing longer?\n\nWhat if I asked her to just crown the wisdom tooth and not its neighbor?\n\nWhat if I do nothing?\n\nFor the record, the 2nd molar also has a fair amount of decay.\n\nI haven’t had panoramic x-rays, but a regular x-ray did show that the 3rd molar roots are pretty close to the nerve and I don’t want to risk having permanent nerve damage even if it’s unlikely. The x-ray also showed that the wisdom tooth is not straight, it’s angled away from the second molar.\n\nI would like to be able to chew hard food on that side again, instead of always chewing on the left side (I did that to avoid disturbing the fragile filling on the right side). Now that the filling has fallen out, I’m chewing soft foods on the right side with no pain.\n\nI’d greatly appreciate some opinions so I can make a decision.\n\nThank you. MattKW: The risk of nerve damage from that extraction is about as likely as getting hit by lightning on a clear day. Any competent dentist or oral surgeon would not have a problem with that.\nThe idea of crowning it and joining to the adjacent tooth is absolutely bonkers, and is much more high-risk than the extraction. \nThere's the risk of damaging the nerve in either tooth (5-10%) then needing an RCT.\nThere's bad angulation that would increase that risk dramatically.\nThere would be a big problem trying to keep the gap between your teeth clean.\nI would have the wisdom removed, and THEN crown the 2nd molar. No other sensible option. gradym: Thanks for the reply, MattKW. \n\nI have read that the risk of having nerve damage that affects the lip, chin and gum is not insignificant. The following is from Coronectomy – oral surgery's answer to modern day conservative dentistry (https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2010.673):\n\n\"Mandibular third molar surgery\nOral surgery procedures commonly involve the removal of MTMs. A significant risk associated with this procedure is temporary or permanent altered sensation to the lower lip, skin of the chin, teeth and gingivae on the operated side caused by iatrogenic injury to the IDN. The incidence of injury to the IDN when removing MTMs varies from 0.41% to 8.1% for temporary lack of sensation and 0.014% to 3.6% for prolonged signs and symptoms.1 In 'high risk' teeth this may reach 20%.\"\n\nAlso see \"Inferior Alveolar Nerve Injury after Mandibular Third Molar Extraction: a Literature Review\" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4306319/\n\n0.014% to 20% (in high risk teeth) does not seem to me to be comparable to the odds of getting struck by lightning on a sunny day. Did you look at my x-ray? The dentist did say that my roots were curved and long, and that made it more risky.\n\nYou think my x-ray does not look risky for damage to the inferior alveolar nerve?\n\nWhen I was searching for a dentist in the Asian city where I am retired, I settled on two finalists. Then I googled these dentists and found Google Reviews for each of them.\n\nBOTH dentists had one review in which the person said he had suffered altered sensation to the lip, chin, gums after a wisdom tooth extraction, which appeared to be permanent. One person said they have pain and involuntary drooling from the corner of their mouth, almost a year later. They were full of regret for having extracted the wisdom tooth.\n\nThese were reviews of the clinic, so not necessarily of the dentist that I see at that clinic.\n\nBased on what I’ve read about coronectomy (a procedure that seems to avoid the nerve damage), it’s contraindicated in teeth with a lot of decay, which my tooth has. (Although I found another article that said maybe it can be done on a decayed tooth.) Anyway, it’s quite difficult to find any oral surgeon here who is experienced in coronectomy.\n\nI also googled my dentist’s suggestion of placing two adjacent crowns and connecting them to prevent any further lengthening of the wisdom tooth due to lack of an opposing tooth. I could find no reference to that procedure. I wonder if that’s a standard procedure or an original idea of my dentist with no precedent.\n\nI guess I have to go to another dentist and get another opinion. Maybe more than one other dentist.\n\nThanks again for your reply. gradym: I just want to add: my dentist isn’t 3rd World trained -- she graduated from a highly regarded dental school in the US and was recommended by local expats.\n\nI do appreciate your opinion. You might be correct. I am very risk-averse on matters like this, and just want to find the best solution.\n\nPlacing two crowns on the 2nd and 3rd molars and joining them seems dubious to me, too.\n\nI still wonder what would happen if I just did nothing. The filling has fallen out and there is no pain. Is it possible the wisdom tooth can eventually come out safely by itself? MattKW: The literature you cite covers all cases of wisdom surgery and all skill levels. I certainly wouldn't let an inexperienced person attempt this extraction. So a good surgeon would have very little risk.\nThe biggest hurdle to removing that tooth is not the root shape or proximity to the IAN. It is the way that the tooth points slightly backwards (disto-angular). Like removing a tree, the direction of the roots determine the direction to apply the forces, so this tooth will come out in a backwards direction, into the bone behind it. This makes it the most difficult factor in your case.\nThe roots of wisdom teeth usually lie to the inner side of the IAN. You are looking at a 2D image so it can look like overlap. In the \"old\" days, we only had 2D images, and this is where a lot of those unfavourable statistics in the reports were developed. Nowadays, a prudent oral surgeon will arrange a 3D image and make plans accordingly.\nIf you wait for pain, then you will have less opportunity to have a well-planned extraction done carefully. And you are not getting younger, so older patients have more medical issues, more medications, and heal more slowly. You don't want to have an emergency at 85 years old when you're in a nursing home. gradym: Thanks Matt for the reply. Sorry it took so long for me to respond. \n\nWell, I went to another dentist and he had different ideas.\n\nFirst of all, I was wrong -- the filling in the 3rd molar did not come out. What came out when I was flossing must have been a piece of the filling from the 2nd molar.\n\nHe said that the 3rd molar did not look like a risky extraction. When I said I was still reluctant to extract it, he suggested I could leave it alone as long as the filling was intact. And he said I could either crown the 2nd molar, or put an overlay on it.\n\nThen I went back to the original dentist and she said an overlay is not strong enough for the biting forces that I would get on the 2nd molar. She also said that if the big filling on the 3rd molar eventually comes out, the filling could still be replaced.\n\nHer suggestion of placing 2 crowns on 3nd and 2nd molars and connecting them -- I think she means “splinting” them.\n\nShe said if I crown both 2nd and 3rd molars and don’t splint them, it will be impossible to prevent food from getting between them, and I won’t be able to keep it clean even with daily flossing. And this will lead to decay and loss of both teeth eventually.\n\nI’m a good flosser so I am skeptical about this. Unless there is something about the angle of the proposed (unsplinted) crowns that will make it impossible to get the floss between them completely.\n\nI see from the x-ray that the 2nd molar’s roots are partially exposed above the gumline. I guess this means it really should be crowned?\n\nThe main thing to me is that I want to be able to bite hard foods on that side, instead of always biting on the other side for fear of dislodging the big filling on the 3rd molar.\n\nI also read somewhere that lower 3rd molars do not generally get longer due to lack of an opposing tooth, this problem is mostly with upper molars. Also, even if the 3rd molar HAS lengthened, it is not getting in the way of my bite on that side. I can still close the bite fully. gradym: Matt, you are talking about getting a CT scan on the wisdom tooth, right? But my risk aversion also applies to radiation -- and isn’t a CT scan a LOT of radiation? MattKW: Where do I begin???\n\nSplinting is the same as connecting or joining them. Still a stupid idea and highly risky, but what would I know? Me and honestdoc probably have 60-70 years of experience clocked up between us.\nGet rid of the wisdom tooth, repeat ad nauseam.\nAll radiation carries risk. You are exposed to background radiation minute of every day. That Xray you have put up above is equivalent to about 8 hours background radiation. A cone beam CT is about 8X that of background, a transatlantic airflight is about 16X that of background. Think about what the crew are exposed to during their working career. gradym: Thanks Matt. I appreciate your opinion and will seek out a really good oral surgeon."

The second option is to have the final metal arch fitted on the same day that the implants are installed - I think this is called \" Smile in a day \". It seems the cost of both are similar at about £12,000. My questions are - What is the professional view of these two options, the pros and cons - and what alternative procedures might be available.

I am trying to use my best judgment to decide on a plan.\n\nI am already missing Tooth #46 and #27.\n\nMy question is: Will I be able to chew if I extract #36?  I would only be able to do my chewing on #34 and #35, on the left side. Tooth #26 will have no opposing bottom tooth if I extract #36. In addition, Tooth #37 will have no opposing top tooth as #27 is gone. (please see attachment from my dentist). \n\nLastly, I need to have extensive sinus polyp surgery in 3 months. Should that have an impact on my decision? Thank you for reading my post. MattKW: If you take out the 36, it will become annoying to eat. If the tooth is indeed dead, then an RCT and crown is preferable, and that seems to be a good price (depending upon where you are).\nYou haven't put up any Xrays to view.

I chew on this side and don’t want to get an infection. I know the pictures aren’t the best but it was hard to get a good picture. Please help, thank you!

You can’t completely close extraction socket within 9 days and tissues are not fully formed yet, but you definitely can use straw now without causing any harm."

    "dialogue": "johnthomas: I had my number 17 wisdom tooth/third molar out 11 days ago. There was a biopsy due to a cyst and a bone graft involved. \n\nAbout 7 days after surgery, the swelling had gone down enough that I could see this. It looks to me a bit like a leach or like the intestine of a nightcrawler that comes out when you’re baiting a hook. It seems to be attached somewhere at the gum, but I can’t see it’s origin.\n\nSomeone suggested that it could be a suture, but it doesn’t look like the other sutures I can see that look like other sutures I’ve gotten. That is to say, they look like a thick, white thread. This looks organic. \n\nSomeone else suggested that it could be a vein that will shrivel and fall off on its own eventually.\n\nI’ve got an appointment to see the oral surgeon again for a followup, but I can’t wait for an answer. This is too bizarre for me to wait.\n\nAny ideas what this could be? honestdoc: It looks like a suture.  The surgeon had to flap back the gums extending toward that particular location and close it in that fashion to access tooth #17.  The suture appears resorbable and will naturally fall off.  As long as you are not in intense pain and no swelling, the healing looks good."

I had my upper right and lower right wisdom teeth removed, two fillings on the left side of the mouth and a root canal and crown done on the left side of my mouth. I have yet to remove the wisdom teeth on the left side and plan to do so separately. I had this done all within a week's time.\n\nThe heeling of the wisdom teeth extraction seems to be going fine but my jaw and overall bite feels quite odd. When I close my mouth my bite feels slightly different but the main thing is my jaw feels like it doesn't want to close, my teeth don't want to rest closed and when I try to close my teeth and mouth there is almost like a slight jitter in the upper and bottom teeth. I don't know if this is just post dealing with keeping my mouth open for hours at a time the last week or if it is something different. My jaw just feels like it wants to shut but can't naturally leading to a overall fatigue feeling in the mouth and head.\n\nMy overall bite does feel somewhat different and I don't know if this is due to the crown or wisdom tooth extraction. Prior to extraction the wisdom teeth were not touching each other so I can't see that influencing things.\n\nWhat input or wisdom can anyone experiences provide regarding this?\n\nThank you! MattKW: I would guess it's more likely the crown and maybe the fillings. Delay the nexxt stage of treatment until this has resolved. If no better in another week, go see the dentist."

    "dialogue": "implant-man: I have a 10-year old implant in my #11 tooth, which has now suffered a significant amount of bone loss, along with a diagnosed peri-implantitis. I have visited a couple of dentists and they differ on whether the implant is worth saving. Also, there are competing opinions on whether to use autograft vs bovine-based graft, but this, I think, is the less relevant issue.\n\nSaving the implant was argued compellingly, as the least invasive course of action. The implant itself isn't moving. Of course, the price is also compelling, vs the alternative.\n\nThe alternative is to remove the implant altogether, which is almost 3-fold more expensive, but was argued that it is the safest, most prudent bet... while at the same time, this dentist was a bit pessimistic about the possible success of the new (auto) graft, adapting... saying that my case has a high risk of failure.\n\nSo I'm confounded as to whether the first is overly-optimistic, or is the second just covering for himself, or non of the above (I appreciate the notion that, in healthcare, there are no guarantees).\n\n\n\nAny opinions? Here is an image of the implant. MattKW: Other Xrays taken over time would help us gauge how active this problem is. But even using that single Xray and a history of peri-implantitis, I'd suggest you have it removed ASAP. The longer it stays there, the more bone you will lose, and the more difficult it will be to make ANY type of replacement, be it an implant, bridge, or denture.\nI don't like your chances of a new implant at all. You might want to look at the possibility of a simple cantilever Marylands bridge off the canine after you've healed up. implant-man: Thanks for your input.\n\nSi you don’t think it’s even worth at least trying to graft it and see if it keeps?\n\nWhen you say there’s a risk I won’t be  able to make any type of replacement... is there’s a scenario where only a prosthesis will do? \n\nThanks again? MattKW: Totally agree with 2nd dentist. Poor chance of keeping this implant; poor chance of grafting and new implant working. Time to cut your losses rather than throwing more money at this situation, sorry. implant-man: I appreciate your honesty. I'm probably going to go for a bridge. The main challenge at this point seems to be saving my gum line.\n\nThanks again."

MattKW: Unfortunately some people have very little gum tissue to work with, or it is so fragile it tears easily. Then we have to resort to less desirable measures to get tissue there, sometimes by simply pulling it in from the cheek, or sometimes by dissecting the skin and repositioning it to cover the defect. Repositioning skin takes skill and is usually done by specialists (periodontist, oral surgeon). I doubt that the dentist would be worried about answering your questions."

The holes are close to being covered but are not quite there and I am still in a lot of pain.  I went by the dentist's office yesterday and the nurse irrigated the holes. She said they are healing and it's normal to take 6-8 weeks to heal. They told me before the surgery it would take a few days until I felt good again. They say what feels like nerve pain to me is just jaw pain. When I mentioned that the pain has been worse than child labor she said that is normal and I am in my 40's and this is to be expected. I've had numerous surgeries in my life along with complications and none have taken this long to heal. I just got a message that they want me to come in for an X-ray in a week. I'm not sure why since they say everything is normal.  I am considering getting a 2nd opinion from another dentist or going to a MD for the pain. I'm a diabetic so i am worried about the slow healing and infection. MattKW: Sounds like you had a dry socket - they usually start 3-4 days post-op. By now it is probably too close to healing over and so placement of a sedative dressing may not be possible. The good news is that even dry sockets heal without dressings. If you have no swelling, temperature, then it is probably not infected. Well-controlled diabetes (are you Type 1 or 2?) does not pose an added risk."

    "dialogue": "juliemra: Everything seemed normal until post surgery day 3 and I woke up with horrible pain in my lower extractions. I called the doc and he said it was muscle pain. I'm 47 with a long medical history so this isn't my first rodeo and I know the difference between muscle and nerve pain. I sent this pic to him and he said he couldn't tell from the pic. I went in today after being in terrible pain for 48 hours and he didn't see me. Instead an assistant told me all about jaw pain and how that is what they think I have. Of course the terrible pain is coming from the lower extraction sites. No one looked at my teeth. They originally told me I would start feeling better a few days after surgery and the pain would basically be gone. Now they say it is normal to have this kind of pain and it may take weeks. I feel like I'm losing my mind and I really just want relief. Opinions? \nNote: I've been putting cotton pellets soaked in honey in the sockets after I numb them. I take Hydrocodone every 3-4 hours and 4 Ibuprophen in between doses. It doesn't take away the pain but it does help a little. I also use heat and cold compresses. I am taking an antibiotic and rinsing with salt water through the day. honestdoc: Are you having any swelling?  No swelling means no antibiotics.  It is hard to know if you have dry socket from the image.  Next time you see the assistant, ask for 2 things...gentle irrigation with Peridex 0.12% Chlorhexidine rinse and Dry Socket Paste. juliemra: So seeing a bone is not necessarily a bad thing? What would cause such tremendous pain if it's not dry socket. I don't have swelling now. I am a diabetic so an antibiotic is probably a good thing. MattKW: Dry sockets are typically diagnosed from : pain starting 3-4 days post-op, unbearable pain that doesn't respond to painkillers, foul taste and breath. There is no point taking antibiotics as this is not an infection but a breakdown in the normal healing pathway. The wound should be gently flushed out (I prefer CHX), and dressed with either a proprietory substance like \"Alveogyl\" or a zinc oxide/eugenol dressing until the healing catches up (usu ~ another 3 days). The dentist may need to give you some anaesthetic just in order to achieve these steps. He didn't even see you? - don't take No for an answer, threaten to call the ADA. That's very unprofessional and neglecting his \"Duty of Care\". juliemra: Thank you for your helpful response. It is now 11 days past the surgery and I am still in horrible pain. My condition fits the dry socket pattern and symptoms. I am taking care of it by flushing with saltwater and using Sockit! or cloves with cotton pellets. I take Hydrocodone and 4 Ibuprofen every 4 hours and they barely touch the pain. The holes do seem to be getting narrower but I wonder if my diabetes is slowing down the healing. I don't know what else I can do for the pain and I do not want to miss more work. I haven't reached out to the dentist again simply because he was so dismissive and insisted it was normal jaw pain after surgery. I don't understand why he wouldn't look at my sites or consider the pain that I described. I am assuming that once the holes close the pain will cease? Is this correct?"

    "dialogue": "oceansmith: Hey, \n\nI had a tooth removed it was number 19 -- my molar. When the surgeon removed it he cut our the outer buckle wall. So What i have left is some bone or the inside buckle wall. The same surgeon says that an implant can be placed on this remain bone but I was under the impression that I would need a bone graft to replace that outer buckle wall. Anyone have any opinions on this? \n\nThanks MattKW: It depends upon how well the bone heals. The loss of a buccal )outer) wall of bone would be a problem for front teeth where the appearance of the gumline is very important, but it's not so much of an issue for a molar. Have it assessed 3 months after the extraction. oceansmith: Ok thanks. Like I said the oral surgeon that cut the buckle wall out said that there would be enough bone for the implant but its hard to know who to trust now when doctors and surgeons tell you something. And  Iwanted to check with some others first.\nWhen my tooth was cut out i didnt know the buckle or the side wall would be cut out as well.\n\nBut thanks for the reply\n\nEdit: So  if the bone has healed well then that is enough bone to place the implant on? There is no chance of that buckle not being strong enough even if it healed back ok? MattKW: Buccal walls are often removed for difficult extractions. Whether you have enough bone for an implant will have to be reviewed a few months after the extraction - I can't advise any more from this position."

    "dialogue": "Kittykebab: Hello all,\n\nApologies for long winded post! \n\nJust wondering if anyone else had their wisdom teeth removed as an adult and suffered with ongoing pain after?\n\nHad 3 wisdom teeth taken out 2 weeks ago under general anesthetic in hospital. After surgery, the consultant told me that one of the lower ones had double the amount of root /nerves as normal and they had to cut away some bone and break it into pieces to get it out, then stitch me back up and to expect bad pain and swelling, but that it should start to get better by about 72 hours later. Pain was so bad on the weekend that I would literally just rock and cry whilst dosing up on paracetamol and ibuprofen. But after 72 hours the swelling had gone down a bit and the bruising came up so I was hopeful it was healing even though I was still in constant pain 24/7 (but not enough to bring me to tears!) and pain relief just didn't touch it. The other two wisdom teeth (or what were) have caused me no pain at all. \n\nDue to continued pain I went to see my dentist to rule out dry socket or any sort of infection. They said it was healing well and no infection, just keep salt water 'swilling'. Went to GP who prescribed codeine and naprofen (which both have their own negative side effects on me) and suggested i adjust doses to suit pain level and signed me off work for a week. To be honest this pain relief hasn't once stopped the pain, occasionally it might just take the edge off, or at least make me drowsy enough to sleep for a few hours at night and keep me sane.\n\nSo now 2 weeks on from surgery and the pain hasn't reduced at all (except after the initial few days when the swelling went down). Still constant, spread from ear to jaw to teeth/gum, localised on the side of my face that the problem tooth was removed from.\n\nIf its a case of 'just deal with it', healing takes longer the older you are, etc. I guess I'm just hoping someone has experience of this and how long it took them to recover roughly. I don't want to just keep moaning and being off work if there's anything else I can do, or that might be the problem. My face isn't numb at all, which seems to be an issue with nerve damage, dentist has said no infection so it's not dry socket. I can still semi-function, but when I take codeine I get drowsy and feel dizzy and also due to pain I'm just not sleeping more than a couple of hours a night, if that, so going to work isn't a great option, especially when I have to drive there. But I do hate having time off work. \n\nAnyone had any similar problems? \n\nThanks in advance. MattKW: How serious is the pain now? Like, what would be a record of your painkillers intake over the course of 24 hours? Kittykebab: Hi, \n\nPain is difficult to describe, but I guess nearest I can describe is a constant dull throbbing ache, with the feeling like someone also has a knife to the gum and is poking it with every throb. This radiates across my jaw up to inside my ear.  Scale of 1 to 10, probably a 7, but enough to stop sleep.\n\nCurrent painkillers on average are paracetamol x2 and codeine 15mg x2 every 4 hours (up to max suggested amount), then additional ibuprofen inbetween. I was on a heavier dose of codeine but this made me really nauseous and 'out of it', so dropped down. MattKW: That's not good for you, but you're doing everything possible. \nIt may be too late, but maybe a dry socket dressing if they can get it into the wound. I prefer ZnO/eugenol mixed with Vaseline and impregnated into a large (sterile) cotton pellet packed up to the brim of the wound. You might need some LA to get it in - ask for some long-lasting stuff like bupivacaine or ropivacaine so you can have a bit of a rest too."

So perhaps the surgeon realises it's complex and does not want you to be distressed or in pain.    \n\nWhy don't you ask whether you can be sedated instead of put right under. MattKW: Some surgeons simply prefer to do work under GA. They line up a day of patients and go through them very quickly. I wish I could do a lot of my work on people under GA too. \n6mm under the gum just turns it into a surgical extraction of a 1st molar that many general dentists encounter frequently. They are nearly always near the sinuses, but as a general dentist I've only punctured the sinus once in 37 years, and it was also the only time I had to refer a surgical 1st molar to a surgeon for repair.\nUpper teeth are easy to effectively numb with local anaesthetic, but a surgical can be a bit stressful given the greater time and difficulty. losing #14: I had my 14 molar extracted one week ago.\nThe procedure was done under local anesthetic and took about 30 minutes.\n\nThe actual surgery only produced minimal discomfort. but the primary source of discomfort was having my mouth forced to stay open with a block.\n\nI was disappointed to discover I needed to pay an extra $450 for a bone graft. I was not told this until the day of the surgery. In fact, I was told virtually nothing until the day of the surgery.  The oral surgeon  did not even look in my mouth during the initial consultation, which really was not even a consultation. He just read the dentists referral out loud to himself, and then I was sent on my way.\nThis lack of information seemed strange, but i guess it worked out fine. I will have my stitches removed in five days.\nI imagine the bone graft is a simple procedure since the entire operation took about 30 minutes.\nThe surgeon was carrying on a conversation about vacations with the receptionist as he was applying the stitches, so i suppose this did not require much concentration on his part.\nI hope the bone graft was necessary.  I hate to think this is a money grab."

    "title": "Tender jaw after infection scraped out of extraction",
    "dialogue": "Tiffany: Three weeks after I had a lower molar extracted, I went back to the dentist who confirmed it was infected. It was filled with very red gum tissue, which after a couple days developed into a round lump in the extraction site. He made an incision and essentially scraped everything out (I could literally hear him scraping against the bone in my socket the whole time. Initially I could feel it too so he gave me more of the numbing shot!). So, I was back to square one like I just had the extraction done again (gauze, clotting, etc). This time, the hole was actually stitched closed to promote healing, since it wasn't healing well before (even before signs of infection). I THINK it's healing better than it was initially (although hard to tell since it was stitched closed this second time & not the first).\n\nHOWEVER my jaw is fairly tender still (week later). It's NOT a stiff muscle feeling, & it's only tender when pressed on the side of my face. I'm not even really sure it's it's the jaw itself, more like if I were to try to poke the extraction area from my cheek. That's the area that still feels sore. However, if I touch the extraction site with my tongue (I don't do this on purpose, but it's happened on accident a time or two!) that doesn't hurt. Just poking from the outside hurts. \n\nIs this soreness just from him scraping so much to get the infected tissue out? & If so, how long can I expect this tenderness? I'm just trying to confirm if it's normal or if the infection went deeper (I'm a worry wart, to be fair, but still lol). I have my follow up in a little over a week (next Friday). The soreness hasn't gotten worse. If anything it has gotten a TAD better since the first day he scraped the socket out, but not much..\n\nThanks!

Do I have the right to insist on a general anesthetic ? As there are 2 more to remove and I don't want to go through that again twice over\nWhy are they not applying the gel first ?

You can ask for IV sedation or GA and see what they say. You might require a referral to an oral surgeon for that. Jonathan Phelan: Yes, different dentist from 12 years ago, I did ask for the gel, I think her reply was \"You don't need it\" Maybe I need to get in touch, sadly there probably wasn't a lot of tooth to get hold of, maybe that was a factor ? GA probably costs the NHS a lot more, with anaesthatista and all that business\nCan I insist on a General Anesthetic, can they refuse ? MattKW: I don't know how it works under the NHS. But they do have restrictive rules for removing wisdom teeth that would be considered very conservative in Australia and USA. You'll have to ask."

MattKW: You've put yourself in a difficult position by leaving it so long. The tooth badly decayed, it is distally impacted (difficult) with very curved roots that come close to the major dental nerve (IAN). You need to have this removed by a competent specialist oral surgeon. He may require a CBCT to make a full assessment.\nWith a wedding next week there is no time to arrange removal plus healing time. The best you might be able to accomplish is either  minimal removal of decay and placement of a sedative temporary filling, or partial removal of the nerve and placement of a temporary filling.

How long will it last? Dr M: Hey there,\n\nBruising is quite common sometimes especially when multiple extractions are performed and it depends on the level of difficulty of the extractions. \nSometimes the dentist has to stretch your cheek etc to gain access to the tooth.\nSome people also bruise easier than others.\nSince the extractions were performed quite recently, I would not worry at the moment.\nHealing can sometimes take a long while,  depending on home wound care, so give it at least a week or so to start the healing process .\nFollow the post operative instructions that your primary dentist gave you, and keep the wound as clean as possible to prevent any infection from setting in.\nIf pain persists after a week, and the bruising has not subsided, visit your dentist again for a follow-up examination.\nIce packs on the affected side, usually helps to reduce any swelling and to help speed up the healing process.\nHope this helps a little"

So, he just removed the whole implant (that was integrated very well with my bone for 2 years) without even telling me. Later I found that it could have been unscrewed by placing an ice cube on it for a minute but he did not do any research or discuss it with me - he just pulled it out!\n\nThe other implant on the right bottom – he removed the crown after placing it this April at the same time saying that it did not go deep enough. He grinded the crown on the sides saying the surrounding teeth were blocking it from going deeper and tightened it too tight (that twisted the implant inside the bone and gave me pain for 5 days) but it did not go any deeper than it did before other than DAMAGING the implant that was well integrated with my bone for 2 years. After he placed the crown, it was fine but when he removed the crown to re-screw it (screwed it too tight), it became loose and painful. He doesn't answer why it did not go any deeper \"vertically\" even after grinding the crown on its sides. Even after a similar disaster with the other implant, he did the same mistake again of tightening it too tight instead of finger tight and I can feel the implant is damaged as it is painful to touch and loose on feeling it with the tongue - I can feel it is moving inside when I push it with my tongue. Is this going to heal after some time and re-integrate with the bone? Or should I have it pulled out and restart with bone grafting?\n\nHe extracted my 2 front bottom teeth and did 4 bone grafting procedures over a 1 year period. He placed 2 implants in the front bottom in Sep last year that failed due to using short implants (8 mm and 10 mm) and they are loose and just sitting on the top of the gums. Later he placed healing caps on them and noticed the implants were short and loose from the X-Ray \"after\" the procedure. That was a waste of time and money! He ordered longer implants (11 mm and 13 mm) and they are sitting in his office for the last 4 months. He says there is not enough bone and gum on the front bottom to place the implants (in spite of doing 4 bone graftings). What is the solution? If they don't have enough gum/bone, why did he extract them instead of doing root canals?\n\nCan I ask him for for a refund for the failed implants and healing caps as they failed due to his experiments on me using me as his lab animal to learn dentistry?\n\nDo I have a case to sue him for damages?\n\nTIA MattKW: \"So, he just removed the whole implant (that was integrated very well with my bone for 2 years) without even telling me.\" A well-integrated implant won't come out that easily. If you have any Xrays we might be able to opine more. Or, get copies of all records and go to another dentist or specialist (like a prosthodontist) for a 2nd opinion."

I have never had any issues at the dentist, although I’ve had plenty of procedures, I’ve never physically started shaking, sweating and almost pass out from the pain..so it came to me as quite the surprise. The reason I think it hurt so bad is that it took more than an hour and my tooth had a hook like appearance (and also the assistant was quite aggressive, my mouth is tiny and he tried his best to widen it, basically rupturing open the side of my mouth.) They stitched me up and told me to come back in 10 days to remove the stitches. They also advised me not to drink anything hot, not to drink from a straw and not consume any dairy products either.\n\nThe next few days (days 1,2,3) were great, I had minimum swelling, the bleeding stopped after day 1 completely and I was prescribed to take antibiotics and ibuprofen. I felt little to no pain at all up until day 4.\n\nDay 4 comes along and I start feeling sharp pain that is consistent, pretty high on a 1-10 scale (6-7) but not as painful as people describe dry socket.

It’s been 2 weeks since I first noticed this area and it has grown in size. I have been seeing my dentist every other day since the operation, but he seems to think nothing is wrong. This is not a dry socket as this area of exposed bone is more forward in my mouth than where the extraction site is, although I’m being treated for a dry socket in this area as well. I have been on 2 different courses of antibiotics - a Z Pack and Amoxicillin and they have not done anything. My dentist has confirmed that this area is exposed bone, but is writing me off as melodramatic. He is not taking any action or telling me what I should do. I am in increasing pain every day, and today has been the worst pain I’ve experienced yet. Should I be concerned or see a new dentist? What should I do? honestdoc: Can you take more images, I can't see as well as I like.  It looks like a large sore with the potential to heal on its own.  If it's exposed bone, it is not normal and you may need to see an oral surgeon.  Normal exposed bone are usually small around the area of the extraction site."

    "dialogue": "fapers: Hello,\n\nI quite worried and confused about what has been happening recently. Well, abt. 6 weeks ago I had my (bottom-right) wisedom tooth removed. After few days I \"digged out\" with a toothpick two peces of bone (which looked simillar to a cut nail). After that I starded feeling onother hard stuff that seemed to be pushing in the gum to get it's way out (everything happening on on the tongue side of jaw). This time however it was by the tooth before wisedom tooth (7th). I thought it must be one of these chips I got out before and tried to pull it out as well. In the effect a piece of bone (looks like a bone or a tooth) showed up. And it was much harder and much more \"fixed\" inside the gum (a photo enclosed). On the side of throat is feels sharp. It also hurts a lot when I push or put pressure on it. I went to my dentist yesterday and first of all he was convincing me that I has got nothing to do with the extraction (I'm not claiming that it's not truth as I'm not a specialist in this subject). When he looked at it he said that is is not a chip but it looks like a regular bone (maybe piece of jaw bone) or a tooth. He said however that he doesn't know and that he hasn't seen anything alike before. He also made an RTG which didn't show anything left in the gum after wisdom tooth axtraction - however as I mentioned that sticking out bone is by the tooth before wisdom and it's roots covered the spot so it was not possible to see what it is. He advised me to wait some time and if nothing gets better I should return to get a CT done to see what that is and how it could be removed.\n\nI decided to ask here, since I'm a bit concerned that the dentist may not be 100% honest with me and he may be saying so so I dont blame him for anything (I wouldn't do it anyway, since I'm aware that somethimes things go wrong, but I would just like to know what is going on there and what should be done now). \n\nI will be very gratefull for your sugestions and advices.\n\nThank you. mrzipper: I have the same issue. Did you find a solution? MattKW: Looks like bone, although a bit forward of where I would expect to see after wisdom tooth extraction. Unlike mrzipper's situation, this is larger and more nasty-looking. If the general dentist took out the wisdom tooth, then ask for referral to OS for opinion. That photo is not enough to judge better on a forum."

    "dialogue": "fredo_corleone: Would appreciate your advice on how I should proceed with a dental implant. So I had a failed root canal (infection and root fractures) and needed a tooth extraction and bone grafting on tooth 14. I went ahead with it late last June (2018) and ended up moving to another city for work so I couldn't complete the procedure with my original oral surgeon. I waited till January so that I could reload my FSA and immediately went to an oral surgeon in my new city who suggested I wait another 3 months (despite it already being 6 months since my extraction) since the bone hadn't ossified (according to the pano x-ray) and also gave me a treatment plan with a mandatory IV sedation (which would have been an additional 1600 out of pocket). I decided not to proceed since I didn't feel like I needed the IV sedation but did wait till early March for another consultation.\n\nI then saw a periodontist recently who said that I only had 6mm of bone (when in actuality I had somewhere between 8-9mm) and gave me a treatment plan for a sinus lift/bone graft to go along with an implant. He said that for tooth 14, I should get a big sturdy implant and that he would use a 10x5mm implant and that he wouldn't go ahead with the procedure without a sinus lift. I sent my x-rays over to the oral surgeon who carried out my original extraction/bone graft and she said that she didn't think a sinus lift was necessary.\n\nI then went to another oral surgeon for a second opinion and he told me that he would use a smaller implant (8mm) to avoid a sinus lift as best as he could, but that he may have to still carry out a sinus lift/bone graft on my plan in case it were necessary the day of surgery. (He won't know till he ends up taking a look.)\n\nI know that it is hard to make any suggestions without an x-ray, but I'm getting mixed messages and I'm frankly confused and frustrated. I'm leaning towards the periodontist since he seems to have better reviews and would most likely not end up puncturing my sinus - although I may have to have a sinus lift unnecessarily. Having said that, I think the oral surgeon would most likely take a more conservative approach (even though he did say the sinus may be breached by 1-2mm) but at the same time, I may end up with a sinus lift if needed on the day of surgery - which would ned up costing the same.\n\nWould appreciate your thoughts and input.\n\nI have been advised from another dentist that I should opt for the oral surgeon (second opinion) since i have 8-9mm of bone height and since he would take a more conservative approach."

I have questions, I need 12 teeth on bottom removed ( all that is left) and wanted to get either 4 implants and a snap on denture and was quoted all in cost with extractions, implants and denture ( $14,500) or all on 4 ( not sure the cost), can anyone tell me if they have had either done and what it cost? Oceansightdental: Hi Dean,\nThe most important question you need to answer is \"what do you have on the top?\" If you have natural teeth or crowns & bridges on the top, then you're going to be miserable with a lower denture. Considering going for all-on-4 teeth if this is the case. On the other hand, if you already have an upper denture, then going for a lower denture is not a bad idea. Typically, all-on-4 teeth is more than double the cost of dentures. In my practice I charge 15k for an all-on-4, but based on your dentist's pricing, I'm guessing he charges around 25-35k. If you'd like to learn more about what exactly all-on-4 teeth are, you can read my article on is all-on-four the right choice for me? Hope this helps and best of luck.\nAli Jazayeri DDS Janiceg63: deansreef said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHello All, I am new to the forum.

Cost of dental procedures vary depending on where you live. Depending on what shape your mouth is in when you start this project. Every person has different needs so to compare costs is difficult. You can break it down to individual things like my quote was 135 per extraction and 1,500 per implant. Then there is the cost of the actual dentures. Here you have choices in material with variable pricing.  I had all my teeth capped 17 years previous so to start the procedure my dentist had to cut out the caps and then extract my roots. I had no periodontal disease.  He said I had 13 extractions total. Then  2 bone grafts in the front of my lower jaw, to build up my jaw bone Then he gave me 7 implants. 4 on top 3 on bottom.  He couldn’t do four on bottom due to not enough jaw bone. Total cost for all was $12,800. This was a complete set of snap ons.  I feel I received an excellent deal.  This dentist was 100 miles away from my residence in Phoenix Az.   It took him 2 years and 3 months. 36 appointments.  My husband and I drove approximately 7,200 miles  spent  easily $1,600 on meals. He just finished this January 2019.  I still need to go back for adjustments as my bottom plate doesn’t want to stay stable. .  Dentists can change the snaps in the dentures to be a smaller size to hold in place but you have to be able to take it out yourself to clean and to sleep. The secret to getting them out yourself is get your mouth rinsed out so it’s wet and using both hands gently rock the plate back and forth and it will eventually come out. Line your thumbs up to where you know the implants are.   All in all I like them the whole concept is much better than just regular dentures. I would shop around. If I would have used a dentist in Phoenix it would have, I think been double. Look for a dentist in a smaller town that owns their own practice. I wouldn’t go to a chain dentistry outfit if I could avoid that. The reviews are not so good on those. \nLastly and very important is when they have you try on the wax replica for your approval, DON’T FEEL RUSHED.  This moment is your last chance to change anything. Look in a two sided mirror so you can see your profile. My lower jaw ended up jutting out so I looked like a barracuda. They had to fix that as it wasn’t right. Make sure you can smile without effort. My top lip was resting so to speak on my lower lip cause the top plate wasn’t curved out enough.  Don’t approve unless you have both plates in. They need to work together.  I found a website that explains what my dentist did. You should lead the article they have on this procedure. Colgate.com .  Good luck to you.   \nP.s. the worst part is when you get your teeth extracted.  They give you a temporary plate to wear.  I couldn’t understand how I could put this plate over my bloody gums but it’s necessary to wear to keep the swelling down. I was only uncomfortable for a  few days to a week. Buy a food chopper!  There is no such thing as one day implants. The implanted posts  have to heal for 4 months to grow around your bone before they finish the posts.  The rest is not bad. There are no nerve endings in your jaw. Read that article! Colgate.com"

The dentist took an X ray and it revealed that my wisdom tooth was pushed into my nasal cavity, lying horizontally on top of the roots of the M2 and M1. I was panicking hard.\n\nWas sent to the hospital immediately. Waited for 3 hours there in panic and with the biggest swelling you’ve ever seen until a surgeon saw me. This surgery took about 2 hours. The surgeons constantly told each other they couldn't get it out etc so I was very afraid. Eventually they had to make the hole in my jaw bigger to get it out. It was done under local anaesthesia because it has the least risks. It were the worst 2 hours of my life. By the time they pulled the tooth out my local anaesthesia was about 3 hours ago and I felt pain, but I was euphoric that they even managed to get it out. Afterwards they sutured the hole(s) between my mouth and nasal cavity.\n\nMy cheek was and is insanely swollen, insanely. My entire mouth is crooked. I got preventative antibiotics and I just have to hope and pray it doesn’t get infected and that it heals.\n\nI'm 22 years old, I think my dentist should've waited with the top teeth, they didn't look problematic and perhaps they would've come down more, oh well."

    "dialogue": "oceansmith: I had to have a tooth extraction last week on one of my molars. It was the large second to last molar on the left side. It had a crack or two in the tooth and it had become abscessed. Also one of the roots were curved to the outside. That being said I went in to a oral surgeon to have it pulled. \nWhen I got out and looked at the area where the tooth was cut out or removed from it looked really low to the jaw line on the outside/cheek side. So i went back to the oral surgeon and I find out that he cut away some of the bone in the jaw to get the tooth out. \n\nHe said he did this because I had really long roots and that he had to \"drill it out in there\". \nIs it common to have to cut away the bone from around the tooth so you can get a tooth out? If I want to get a dental implant I will probably have to get a bone graft now. \nI also had the doctor use PRP and I suppose he put the PRP in the root cavity but if he removed part of the bone would he have still been able to use the PRP correctly? \n\nThanks for anyone who can comment on this. MattKW: Unfortunately we usually have to extract crappy teeth that are at risk of fracturing. This increases the risk of having to remove bone in order to get hold of the roots. Quite common. I'd prob do one a week. Not that I want to because it takes up more time, but because there's no other way to get it out. oceansmith: well, when you have to remove \"crappy\" teeth from a patients mouth by cutting away part of the jaw bone do you inform the patient? Isnt that part of informed consent? \nI thought most teeth were split anyways to allow for the tooth to be pulled at an angle out of the socket. \nI had called another dentist who does implants and I asked them about the same procedure that I had and they told me that they tried everything to make sure they preserved the bone. \nMaybe not all dentist have such a cavalier attitude about their patients. MattKW: Yes, it's informed consent and I always warn patients if I think there's the least chance of it becoming difficult and surgical. Unfortunately, it doesn't mean that there's always an easier way to take out some of these teeth; you make it sound as if there is always a choice. \nTeeth are not always split to be removed - that only applies for certain teeth in specific situations; I'd much rather get it all out in one piece. \nI certainly don't go looking to make it harder for me or the patient. I'm all for preserving bone WHERE POSSIBLE. And you misunderstand me, I'm not being cavalier, just practical, and endeavouring to answer your question. oceansmith: Well its good that you inform the patient. I wasnt informed. I was just put to sleep and it was cut out with some of my bone. \nMaybe the question should have been \"how many dentist dont tell their patients they are going to remove bone during a procedure?\" \nI didnt know that a dentist could not remove a tooth without having to cut out bone from my jaw. Makes you wonder how people have done it for eons before. MattKW: The mere fact you had to go to an oral surgeon is never a good sign; usually means it's likely to be a tough extraction.And \"in the good old days\", people simply suffered or died from infections."

Any advice would be greatly appreciated regarding the wisdom teeth and other teeth in general. Thank you all for reading. honestdoc: I always favor conservative, less traumatic options.  As long as you aren't having pain and have no bone disease, gum disease, cavities, etc, and you are keeping them clean, I would leave them.  Other dentists may choose to extract them to prevent future problems which maybe more popular.  Keep in mind that any extraction/surgery run the risk of injury and trauma.

These teeth are never go to be of significant use, and it appears as if the lowers are partially covered by gum.\nHow can you maintain these plaque traps for the next 50 years? You don't want to be an elderly person with other health problems that make extractions difficult, e.g. osteoporosis, blood thinners, poor healing, ... Busybee: I can see the logic in wanting to do this when someone is young but I also had a school friend who died having their wisdom teeth out as a teen.   Every surgical procedure carries a risk, leaving the teeth in the mouth also carries a risk. MattKW: Yes, logic drives the decision, and the logical decision points towards doing when younger. If we're trading anecdotes, I had a personal friend whose unerupted wisdom tooth developed a huge cyst and he had to have his right jaw resected at age 62. I have the Xrays. The risks are much, much less when you're younger. Busybee: I've been told by a dentist that there is greater risk of facial nerve damage if you have the extractions after the age of 30.  Is that true and if so why? MattKW: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI've been told by a dentist that there is greater risk of facial nerve damage if you have the extractions after the age of 30.  Is that true and if so why?\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\n.\nThe factors that have been suggested to explain this situation are increased bone density, surgical difficulty, complete formation of the root and reduced capacity for subsequent healing. It's not just the paraesthesia but complications generally. Busybee: The NHS only removes them routinely if they are impacted or infected.   A private dentist offered to remove mine at 25 but I was horrified.   I only found out when it was too late that there are risks in extraction as you get older.   They did cause problems with my bite and one is really difficult to clean because it's at an angle.    I did have them sealed which has really helped.   But it's a shame the NHS are not more open about the long term problems you can get by leaving them intact.  By the time they grow people stop going to the dentist regularly as it's no longer free. MattKW: As I understand it, the NHS follows the NICE Guidelines which are quite conservative. It's also convenient for the NHS as it saves money (cynical). I have seen some literature which is wondering if there should be a rethink about the Guidelines. Oceansightdental: I agree with Dr. Matt. You absolutely need all of your wisdom teeth removed (all 5). The lower right one has a cyst. The lower left one has created substantial crowding issues. Once you remove the bottom two wisdom teeth, your upper wisdom will move downwards and create issues. The sooner you remove these problematic teeth, the easier it is to treat them. They'll start getting painful and infected within the next few years, but removing them when you're in pain is more challenging and not the correct approach. Any dentist that would advise you NOT to remove your wisdom teeth has not had enough experience with wisdom teeth and the consequence of ignoring them. Best of luck!\nAli Jazayeri DDS"

I do want implants but at almost 77 years young, I don't want to empty my bank account for them.  So, can you implant one or two teeth, or was I misinformed? Oceansightdental: Unfortunately, one or two implants can not handle your entire bite forces. If you want permanent teeth, a minimum of 4 dental implants is needed. This is called an all-on-4, and the cost is around 20k as you had mentioned. Less expensive options are overdentures, where your denture locks onto 2 or 4 implants. Now this is a removable option, but much more comfortable than dentures alone. Plus, overdentures are typically far less expensive, costing around 5 to 10k. Don't forget, 77 is the new 57, and investing a bit into more comfortable teeth is certainly worth it for most!"

Before the implants were put in, I had one tooth (no. 4, only the root remaining at the time) extracted in the same session.  The other tooth had been missing for 3 or 4 years.  The oral surgeon had one post in the hole where the root of no. 4 just came out.  No. 4 was angled.  The end result is the two posts are close to each other and close to the neighboring molar, but further from the much smaller premolar.  The two posts are straight, parallel to each other.  My concern is if the crowns are put on (if there's a way to make that happen), they won't be centered on the posts.  Also note that no. 3 is much larger than no. 4.  So even if they manage to put the crowns on, it won't last (I assume), because the crowns would be imbalanced on the posts.  I'm attaching the x-ray here (showing teeth no.2 to no. 5 from left to right).  It doesn't seem there's enough space for the crown for no. 3, and the post for no. 4 would be outside of its crown area.  Is this a bad enough job that needs to be undone, or should I go ahead with the abutments and crowns?  I will greatly appreciate your thoughts and insights.  Thanks a lot! Oceansightdental: Your implants look very nice, don't be worried. The fact that the implants aren't perfectly centered is not an issue and corrected at the time of restoration. Generally, 1-2 mm deviation is not an issue and your restorative dentist will correct this deviation later. Your crowns will work out just fine and last a long time. So long as the implants are not moving or infected, you should be in good shape!"

    "dialogue": "larryy: Good afternoon everyone,\n\nAbout 10 years ago, I had a large cavity on my upper left 6th tooth. I got treatment on one of the roots and had a silver crown inserted. For the last few months, I've had a bit of pus discharge from the gum above the upper left 6th tooth. I went to the dentist recently and was prescribed antibiotics for the infection. I also had scans taken and the dentist advised me that the upper left 6th tooth and roots need to be completely extracted and that I need an implant. I have no pain in the tooth and I am scared of having this procedure done.\n\nCould you please kindly have a look at the attached x-ray scans and provide your independent opinion on this matter.\n\nThank you very much. honestdoc: UL 6th tooth (in the US, the tooth is labeled #14) does have extensive damage and missed 2 (Mesial buccal and MB2) canals.  The tooth does need to be extracted because it is a source for infection and contamination.\n\nThe extraction process for this case is not bad.  Since there is already an infection, the bone around is softer and less prohibitive to remove the tooth (the body wants to get rid of any infected material).  The tooth will come out in pieces so don't let that scare you. \n\nYou may not need an implant.  Implants are expensive and are just elective.  I think leaving the space is realistic.  Back teeth will shift (tip) forward and the opposing tooth will erupt up.  However, judging from the upside down bitewing x-ray, your bottom opposing tooth will not hyper-erupt due to opposing the tooth in front and the upper back tooth should minimally tip.  As long as you are functioning without difficulties, you may not need an implant.\n\nIf you desire an implant for certain, I recommend placing bone graft immediately after tooth extraction to strengthen and prepare for future implant.  You may also need sinus lift surgery to accommodate an implant. MattKW: Extract it because even though the RCT could be redone, it has a poor crown on it that would need replacement too. Have to disagree about leaving a gap. Tilted teeth create cleaning problems. If you want to leave the gap, then I would suggest extracting the wisdom tooth to minimise risk of 2nd molar tilting over. Aim for implant in long term, but don't let whoever did the RCT or crown anywhere near this. honestdoc: Leaving a gap is what most of my patients could only afford.  I live in an expensive state and most of my patients are poor and put almost all of their money into housing/rent much less into dental prosthetics like implants.  I have no opinion with removing the wisdom tooth to minimize #15 tipping.  However I always prefer the least traumatic plan.  I do agree that tipped molars create undercuts for food trap but I observe many patients adapt...they don't have much choice. MattKW: True enough, we don't all have choices we'd like. Oceansightdental: That tooth is very infected and needs to be removed ASAP. Additionally, the tooth is right on the sinus so most likely it is draining into your sinus cavity and causing a widespread infection. Start off by taking a few days of antibiotics, Augmentin or at least Amoxicillin, and remove the tooth and place bone graft to close the space. If you can afford an implant great, but at a minimum you should remove the infected tooth to prevent infection from spreading to the rest of your body."

    "title": "Lingual Gum Graft--How to do it right",
    "dialogue": "dtatum: How to Get Your Periodontist to do a Successful Behind the Teeth (lingual) Gum Graft\n\n\n\n            Gum grafts done on your interior gums (lingual) are notoriously difficult to do, primarily due to the motion of the tongue dislodging the delicate gum graft.  Having had two relatively unsuccessful lingual gum grafts done just behind by lower front teeth (lateral incisors), I wanted to try something different. At $2,000 per attempt paid out of pocket, I had strong motivation to try something new.   \n\nMy periodontist (Dr. Soolari) had previously done four different totally successful gum grafts on my exterior gums demonstrating a high level of skill and a mastery of his profession; although he did say numerous times that I was an excellent patient (excellent I guess means strictly adhering to the post-surgery protocol).  Since I knew Dr. Soolari was properly doing the lingual gum graft surgeries correctly, and I knew that I was a good patient, I thought an idea that I had just might work.\n\n            In January of 2017 I proposed to my periodontist that he make a relative cheap plastic night guard that would firmly attach to the teeth but would deliberately leave space to completely cover my next lingual gum graft.  My thought was that despite very careful daytime management of my tongue while awake (no talking, liquid diet) my tongue was dislodging the graft at night while I was asleep.  He agreed to try it.\n\n            Making the custom post-surgery night guard was clearly a first time thing for his office.  After making a mold of my lower jaw and despite my repeated instructions for a specialized post-surgical night guard, the office staff produced a rugged rigid standard night guard that only fit on the tops of the teeth to prevent teeth grinding at night (I already had one of those).  With the surgery only days away, my periodontist managed to make a cheap plastic flexible night guard that covered the lower interior teeth, and some of the gum.  When I saw it, it didn’t look like it would cover all of the upcoming surgical area but Dr. Soolari assured me that it would.  Otherwise, the thin, flexible, lightweight, clear plastic night guard was just what I had envisioned.\n\n            On the day of the surgery (April 22, 2017), after the procedure, he carefully put on the custom night guard and it covered most of the surgical area but not all, which turned out to be good enough much to my relief two weeks later when the night guard came off and the numerous stitches came out.\n\n            The results were, quantity wise, absolutely stunning.  The amount of new gum was between 10 and 15 times greater than what had adhered on either of the prior two largely unsuccessful lingual grafts.  The night guard seemed to both protect the surgical site AND gently apply pressure to the gum graft itself which no doubt helped more of the rather large piece of tissue ‘stick’ to the target site.\n\n            So if you have an upcoming gum graft on your interior gums, insist on an inexpensive custom night guard to totally cover the surgical area in order to protect the site from the tongue’s movements while you are asleep.  To be extra safe (as I did), wear the night guard 24 hours a day (except for cleaning) and go to a liquid diet only for the first seven days, then only very soft food for day 8-14.  The less you talk the better.  Finding a periodontist as good as Dr. Soolari won’t hurt either!\n\n            Having done some research on the use of antibiotics, infection, and dental surgery, I decided to go against doctor’s orders and not take an antibiotic during or after my surgery.  I had, as usual, no swelling at all and very little post-surgical pain and absolutely no infection.   Antibiotics kill off most of the beneficial bacteria in your body, and more diseases are being traced to inadequate gut bacteria, so using antibiotics is something I don’t like to do unless there is no other alternative.\n\n            If the custom night guard covers too much of your exterior lower gums, it may produce uncomfortable pressure.  The solution is to take a sharp knife or scissors and make a small cut in the center where it covers the exterior gums; that will significantly relieve the pressure on your gums.\n\n\n\nKey Search Terms: gum graft, lingual, interior gums, custom night guard, antibiotics, gut bacteria, dental surgery."

I was given 16 days of 500 mg keflex 4x per day.\n\n\n\nFast forward. An attempted root canal 14 weeks ago turned into a broken tool in my root. Which turned into an extraction. I had very firm thick roots. The dentist said it was the toughest extraction he has ever done out of 6000. Almost the whole tooth came out with a crunch though they did have to dig out one root tip. The dentist said to get ready for pain. And pain it was. For two weeks excruciating pain. Checked multiple times, no infection was visible. It seemed to be healing normally. \n\n\n\n4 weeks post extraction and it was still hurting. Very painful to push in the gums toward the front of my mouth in my gun line. Went back to the dentist.

No imaging was performed. \n\n\n\n6 weeks post op and it is still very painful to push on though fine otherwise. The actual extraction site didn't hurt. When I pushed on the front of the gum line where the tooth extracted it is very sensitive and painful. \n\n\n\nAfter this (5 weeks ago) I went to another dentist for a second opinion... He did a 360 degree x ray and found a piece of infected root tip. It was extracted almost 4 weeks ago. It was very swollen and painful when he extracted, and some pus came out. He cleaned it out. Since then it has stopped throbbing. However now even with slight pressure on the inferior gum of the tooth adjacent to it there is intense pain. It only hurts when I push on the inferior gum. The dentist did say a lot of gum tissue was moved around. But should it still be hurting that badly to slight pressure on the gums? Any advice is helpful. Thanks. Busybee: Magicman that sounds awful.  You lost a tooth due to negligence and then it wasn't even extracted without failing to do that properly.  \n\nI know it's too late for that tooth, but for future reference never let a general dentist perform a root treatment.  Always go to a specialist endodontist.  They do this every day and they have all the tools and equipment but most of all the experience of dealing with so many different situations.   On top of this it's best to go to a specialist oral surgeon for extractions of large molars and in particular wisdom teeth.  I know dentists do this and some are very good but some aren't that experienced these days because they rarely need to take teeth out compared to the bad old days.   \n\nI'm sure what you have had done will take some time to settle down but you should go to a specialist oral surgeon for an opinion on why you are still in so much pain and just to check that a nerve wasn't damaged.  \n\nI hope you feel better soon. magicman81: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMagicman that sounds awful.

Funny enough the root canal that failed was performed by an endontist. He said that the root was very curvy and the tool just broke.\n\nI plan on going to an oral surgeon for any further extractions. My dentist told me to give my current situation another week or two. That said if it continues or gets worse I will go in immediately. I am just frustrated and am ready to be out of pain. Thanks so much for the reply. Busybee: Well best of luck.  I do hope you are out of pain soon.  I have only had teeth extracted as a child but I do remember that you can get \"ghost pain\" for years or weird sensations in the gum.  Even now flossing it feels a little tickly compared to the other gums.   Yours is so recent.  Maybe give it time and see if it settles."

As long as you are not experiencing any swelling, just let it heal.  Lower wisdom teeth are more traumatic to remove.  You should consider removing your tongue ring (at least before bedtime) because it can damage your teeth and gums.

    "dialogue": "aqz: Hi doc, \nIve had this lesion for over 6 months as far as i have been aware. Its not painful and does not bother me. I do get geographic tongue that can get irritated from time to time. Ive have anxiety over this but however have been overcoming it. And now its just on my mind again. It hasnt grown in size and is the same as when i first noticed it over 6 months ago. I have been to few dentists and my gp whom dont seem concerned and said its prib due to me smoking. Also i have alopecia so doc said it could be lichen as that is also an auto immune response. I also had mild crohns few years ago which has now gone. So we dont know why i had inflammation in the intestines. Sorry to go on, i hope you can put my mind at some sort of ease. I am a panicky person when it comes to health, which means i will always think the worst. Look forward to a response. \n\nKind regards honestdoc: If it is there for more than 6 months and numerous dentists and your gp checked it, I'm also suspecting it is autoimmune response.  Have your dentist/GP prescribe you Triamcinolone in Dental Paste and check to see if any improvements occur.  In the meantime, please consider quitting smoking because it increases your risk of mouth cancer.\n\nSomething is causing an autoimmune response.  Are you using anything irritating like different toothpaste, mouth rinses, herbal supplements, new medications, spices, and/or cinnamon products? aqz: @honestdoc Thank you so much for your response. No i havnt been recommended anything to use on it as it is not painful and does not bother me. But when i wake up the area is always covered in whitish coating which then rubs off after eating etc.. The fact that i learned to forget checking it for 6 months and it still the same does it indicate something serious? I do eat spicy foods etc and my diet is not the best. I am a very anxious and stressful person. I am going through alopecia at the moment which i believe is also a auto immune response. I am scared of going back to docs as i assume i will hear the worst now. I have a sensitive mouth which gets irritated but nothing i cant handle. honestdoc: Triamcinolone (in Dental Paste) is a corticosteroid which suppresses the autoimmune's destructive response.  However, you indicated that you get a whitish coat which rubs off.  Have it checked to make sure it is not a fungal infection (don't use the paste on fungal infections, it makes the area worse). aqz: @honestdoc ok but if it was fungal can it still be there after 6 months? I do get geographical tongue area which can go white time to time. Also i would like to add i have a deviated septum so sleep with mouth opened hence wake up with dry mouth/tongue. aqz: This is how it looks at the moment so its does improve slightly and the worsens etc. honestdoc: I think it is a fungal infection.  You must have some immune compromised condition(s).  Do you have diabetes as well?  Are you taking certain medications? aqz: @honestdoc. So a fungal infection can linger for this long? No i dont have diabetes as far as i am aware and not on any medications. I was on pentasa for when they thought i had crohns disease. Im really worried to go back to docs/dentist, i fear i will be told its oral cancer... honestdoc: I don't think you have cancer.  I believe you have an immune system imbalance.  It can damage your body if you don't address it.  Also stop smoking and try to live a healthier lifestyle. aqz: @honestdoc ok thanks for your advice. Do you suggest a biopsy? honestdoc: That may be at last resort to minimize trauma of removing the lesion.  Try to treat the lesion first (get your doctor/dentist evaluation). aqz: Ok in your opinion how would you treat it qt first? aqz: @honestdoc honestdoc: Have your dentist prescribe you oral topical antifungals like Nystatin or azoles.  Hopefully the lesion will respond within 2 weeks.  Have your medical physician manage and control your Crohn's and other conditions because fungal infection can return. If the lesion does not get smaller, have it removed...most likely it is not cancerous.\n\nIf you continue to smoke, that lesion could get irritated and develop into a reactionary precancerous tissue. aqz: @honestdoc thanks for your advice much appreciated. Also can i ask how long you have been a dentist and which country you based in? honestdoc: I have been a dentist for over 20 yrs in the US.  I'm in the beautiful Pacific NW. aqz: @honestdoc great! Just another question if this was cancer would there have been significant change in 6 months of it being untreated? honestdoc: Many cancers can get bigger in 6 mos.  Some grow very slow and you won't notice the difference.  In the study of pathology, when you hear hoof beats think horses not zebras (cancer is a zebra).  Again, have the lesion treated and if it doesn't respond in ~2 to 4 wks, biopsy it. aqz: Hi what do you mean by hoof beats? @honestdoc honestdoc: It's just a saying that when you hear a bunch of horses running (hoof beats) you think the noise is from horses not from Zebras (not likely Zebras are in North America).  When dentists evaluate lesions in the mouth, we think of the most likely reasons for the lesions (horses causing the hoof beats not zebras)."

Don't use too much acetaminophen due to liver toxicity, and take after meals with ibuprofen's toxicity to stomach and GI tract.  If the pain keeps you up at night, you may need your dentist to prescribe you narcotics like hydrocodone 5 mg (usually comes with 325 mg acetaminophen) or even oxycodone 5 mg. mineladivovic: @honestdoc thank you so much for your advice, I highly appreciate it!\nAll the best to you doc!"

    "title": "Post Bone Graft Question - night guard vs Essix temporary?",
    "dialogue": "jdanham: I had one of my upper front teeth extracted yesterday. The surgeon said there was zero bone to work with for the implant post, so he performed a bone graft. My dentist asked me to bring my latest impressions from February (used for my night guard) so they could create the temporary (Essix?) appliance before the surgery.  After the procedure was completed they put in the new appliance with the temporary tooth. Immediately it felt wrong. The rear bite alignment was not comfortable and I said so, but they just said thats the way it works????\nSo being a Friday I can't really reach out to anyone for some feedback and suggestions except here. When I asked them about the need to keep the temporary in, they said it's really only needed for when I am out in public and that I can remove it at home. \nProblem for me is that with it removed I have a tendency to feel things with my tongue and the appliance, though uncomfortable, prevents me from doing anything stupid to the bone graft and surgical area. \nI am afraid to use my normal night guard (which fits perfectly) because I think it may damage the gum near the sutures, and I am also afraid that when I remove it in the morning the suction might dislodge or otherwise damage the bone graft. If the post op rules say no straws then this would definitely be as strong or stronger than sucking on a straw.\n\nIf I keep the temporary on even eating soft foods is not pleasant because of the bite alignment.\n\nI am otherwise following the rules and will be able to use salt water rinse later this evening and then the other prescribed rinse on Sunday. \n\nIn the meantime, should I avoid using the night guard? I had the temp in last night and my jaw was sore but otherwise ok. \n\nHope that I can get some feedback today, thanks for listening honestdoc: Do what you can to minimize disturbing the bone graft site.  When your dental team is available, have them adjust your appliance to fit more comfortably. Once the site is healing and the sutures have resorbed/removed, I believe you can wear your night guard. MattKW: You should be OK to wear your night guard because this should not impinge on the graft site. Any suction should also have no bearing - you can't suck out something unless you can get air under it."

I have osteoarthritis in my back, with some slippage; which is basically a big spider of spurs in my lower back and I take a minimal dosage of pain meds daily.

Yes, some minimal pain relief would be nice. I keep my dosage low on opioids, because I don't want to build up a resistance, but when the pain is screaming I do need some relief. The Dentists I've seen have had such an attitude, it's not worth even discussing it with them. Besides, my back pills are prescribed for my back, not for Dental work.\n\n2. I discovered my allergy to NSAIDs, after I ended up in the ER. I never had those problems before I was exposed to black mold. I have asthma from the black mold and I take Symbicort.\n\n3. No, I believe my liver is good, I'm pretty healthy, other than my back (and a few other problems), but I'm already taking tylenol in my daily dosage of pain meds. Tylenol really doesn't work for that kind of pain. I would be fine with taking NSAIDs, because I think the anti-inflammatory part does play a key role, but again, I get a severe asthma attack going when I take them.\n\n4. No, I've not looked into a selective Cox-2 inhibitor, I was under the impression that they are closely related to the NSAIDs. I will do some more research on those. I don't have health insurance, so I am on my own on a lot of this problem.\n\nI've spoken to my doctor about it and he sympathizes, but I've never asked him to increase my dosage. Thank you for that suggestion, maybe I can find a dentist who could coordinate with my doctor, though I'm afraid to call around without getting branded a pill seeker. Chronic pain patients shouldn't be treated this way, we are fighting to live and most are responsible with their medications. I appreciate your reply and thank you again. MattKW: OK, best of luck. With regards to the COX-2 inhibitors, there are some that cross over to the NSAID realm.

    "dialogue": "Allie80: So I've managed to dodge the dentist for the last 4 years but after an impacted wisdom tooth made an appearance a few weeks ago, I finally gave in and visited the dreaded dentist today.\n\nNot only have I got to have the impacted tooth removed, it turns out I've got to have the another one out along with some bone!\n\nNow, I have already got a real fear of dentists so this was my worst nightmare and the dentist offered me sedation options immediately as I was getting into a bit of a state.\n\nSo my next problem is: obviously, i'd like them to just knock me out but i'm worried that it won't work and they'll just paralyse me and I won't be able to tell them it hasn't worked. So I read somewhere that I can get a sedative to relax me but keep me concious. I just really want to know what it's like and if it's worth it or should I just go down the general anaesthetic route?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated   \n\nMany thanks\n\nAllie MattKW: Which method you choose depends on a few factors:\n\nHow many teeth need to be taken out?\nHow many do you want out at a time?\nHow difficult will they be to remove?\nWhat is your level of dental experience?\ne.g. If I have an experienced patient who only needs a 1 or 2 moderately difficult tooth to remove, then they can have the choice of local anaesthetic (LA) with relative analgesia (RA, or nitrous) in my rooms, or an intravenous sedation (IV) with my local oral surgeon and anaesthetist, or a general anaesthetic (GA) with my local oral surgeon and anaesthetist. If they're a young person who has 4 wisdom teeth to be removed, but who's never had much dental treatment, then I will suggest all 4 be removed in one sitting under a GA. And then there's all the variants in-between. The cost increases as the complexity increases. Without the benefit of seeing your X-rays, I'd suggest you either need an IV or a GA. Oral sedation (e.g. temaze, diazepam) is OK with the right patient, but doesn't allow for instant change of dosage that a real IV allows, and I rarely put that in the mix. Allie80: Thank you so much for the advice. Have you got any idea what IV sedation actually does/makes you feel like? honestdoc: I personally had IV sedation for medical procedures and I was totally out.  I worked on people on IV sedation and to some, they don't work well such as constant moving and jerking, PITA and impossible to work on.  Think drilling on moving and dodging teeth.  How tolerant of pain medications, alcohol, and local anesthetics are you?  If it takes a lot to numb you, you may be hard to sedate.  \n\nThere are very difficult risks involve with sedation.  First, you can't have anything to drink or eat usually 6 to 8 hrs before.  When you are sedated, everything relaxes and your stomach contents could come up and drown you.  Secondly, your heart and breathing could relax too much and the team needs to be ready to resuscitate you.  In rare cases, the team may not successfully do that.  Your medical history and conditions are so important to discuss."

    "dialogue": "zent: Hello,\n\nThank you for your time!\n\nMy father is 81 years old and lives alone in India. He is in good health and is physically active.\n\nHe has been using a full denture (11 teeth ) in his upper jaw since Aug 2014. Yesterday, the dentures came off and he could not  chew or bite. Since he does not like using an adhesive on his dentures, he went to see his dentist. When I spoke to the dentist through an electronic chat after the visit, the dentist advised me of two choices:\n\n#1:  Make a new denture and secure it inside his mouth with three dental implants. The implants are only for supporting the new denture. The implants will remain in his mouth for all of his life. This will make it easy to chew. The side effects are minimal.\n\n#2: Try a new denture with additional teeth (more than 11 ) and use an adhesive for as long as possible. When this fails, a new denture along with dental implants will be needed (as mentioned in #1).\n\nI would like to delay putting any implants on my father's mouth for as long as possible. But the worry is, at some point in future, he will need dental implants to support his dentures. \n\nQuestions:\nWill it make it much harder for him to go through the dental implanting procedure at an older age when he might be not as healthy? Should we just go with dental implants when he is feeling fine?\n\nI would be grateful for any experiences people might have with their parents or elderly relatives who had similar issues. \n\n\nThank you,\nZent honestdoc: Placing implants can be traumatic and integrating them into bone can be less predictable with various medical conditions.  I agree that he shouldn't jump into implants.  Try maybe relining them if he was able to use them before or new dentures if the old ones aren't performing properly. zent: Thanks a lot for your reply! We have sought a second opinion from a Prosthodontist and it was exactly what you said. We are proceeding with a new denture and avoiding implants"

IF it was to snap then what \n\nAny advice and nice words please honestdoc: Without images, I will generalize the procedure and what to expect.  Many times the molar extractions will come out in pieces due its multi-root anatomy.  Since you will be numb for this, you should not feel pain other than pressure.  Any procedure may have rare complications.  A rare possible complication for your case is sinus perforation.  If it is smaller than 4mm, it can predictably be repaired.  If greater, then an Oral Surgeon may need to repair it.  Rest assured, the complications do not happen but the rarest of times.

    "dialogue": "AJK64: I am hoping someone here can help me and answer my questions.\n\nI am likely going to have to have a failed root canaled tooth extracted. The tooth is an upper left first molar. From the xrays taken during the endodontic treatment, it appears that one of the roots of this tooth runs directly into my left maxillary sinus.\n\nI am going to be seeing a new dentist on Wednesday to talk about my options. What can/should I ask during the consultation in order to reduce the risk of sinus perforation? Is there any way of determining for certain if the root does run into the sinus? Are there any procedures I can request that would minimise the risk? honestdoc: How certain do you know that the root canal failed?  If you have no pain and no swelling, no treatment is the best.  It is hard to determine the exact proximity of the sinus with the 2 dimensional x-ray but the roots are very close.  \n\nHave a good discussion with your new dentist.  Best case scenario, you don't need to take out the tooth.  He or she may feel comfortable taking the tooth out but a sinus perforation or damage can potentially occur.  If the perforation is greater than 4 mm, it needs to be repaired by an oral surgeon. AJK64: It's 10 weeks since the root canal was completed and I am still in daily pain. It has background pain (around a 3/10 constant ache) and is very painful to touch (peeks to around a 7 or 8/10 when I brush my teeth).\n\nI have had pain for about 9 months now since the problem with this tooth began and it's really starting to ruin my life and I just want an end to the pain, so looking like an extraction is my last hope honestdoc: Do you have more pronounced pain when you bend forward or walk up or down stairs?  If so, it may not be the tooth but a possible sinus pain.\n\nIf it is, then extraction is the most predictable option.  Again, have a good discussion with your upcoming dentist. AJK64: No extra pain on bending or climbing no. It's mainly only triggered by touching the root canaled tooth. The pain radiates up into my eye socket at times and into the side of my head too MattKW: Sad to hear it's still going poorly. The RCT looks good, but that doesn't compensate you much. I don't know why it continues to plague you, and I have to agree I'd prob extract too given your history. It's not like you haven't tried to push through. As for the extraction, the tooth will probably fracture and have to be taken out in sections. A bit fiddly but these are done all the time. Chances of sinus perforation are low if your dentist is experienced. You might ask if he's got some long-lasting LA to help control the post-op pain (Marcain, Naropin,...) so you can get a bit of rest. All the best. AJK64: Saw the new dentist. She did a thorough examination and took a few xrays. She is referring me to the maxillo-facial surgeons do they can try and figure out what is wrong. She was particularly concerned about the pain I am getting in my head. She also said that they can advise me on extracting the root canaled tooth safely and if there is a sinus perforation they are in the best position to deal with that too. Hopefully it won't be too long waiting"

I was in pain for about ten days after the second sinus lift and even the pain medication(percocet) i was prescribed did not fully take the mind-numbing pain away.  It was really brutal.  My question is why is my sinus lift hurting so much?  Is it because of condition of the tooth?  Doc had to put in a lot of material(i think bone) during operation.\n\nI just had another sinus lift yesterday and pain was really bad that I had to ask towards the end of the operation for more injections of whatever medication they numb your gum/tooth with.  \n\nI was prescribed percocet but due to what he says was a malfunction on his computer he said the prescription could not go through.  After waiting two hours for them to clear it up at the pharmacy I was in so much pain I had to go back to have him inject me with pain medication on the gum to ease the pain.  He said he was puzzled that motrin did not take the pain away.  \n\nI took motrin and tylenol and the pain did not ease.  I woke up in the middle of the night and could not go back to sleep because of the pain.\n\n29 hours after the operation I am still in a lot of pain.

The abutments and crowns on top of the implants can be done any time after this as they don't affect the bone.

    "dialogue": "Ryan_D: I had a bilateral wisdom tooth removal last Tuesday and although the swelling and pain has now gone, I've been left with a movable red lump / sack in my gum (highlighted in picture) where my lower-left wisdom tooth was extracted.\n\n\n \nI'm not certain, but I think it was there straight after surgery. Is this normal and has anyone else had similar? Thanks for any help. Jane: Had surgery for buried wisdom tooth two months ago have swelling at back of mouth very much like yours did you find anything out about this is it normal and has yours gone plus is there anything i should be doing to help am still swilling with salt water though im not sure it helps thanks for any help jane Ashleyrhe123: I have the same thing. My dentist expressed the infection, but it closed up and bubbled back up within an hour of leaving the dentist. What was the result from yours? honestdoc: There could be a few possibilities.  The most realistic is normal tissue formation in a reactive healing pattern.  Another possibility is having debris or exfoliating bone (sequestrum) trapped under.  The worst case scenario is prior to surgery, you had taken medications called bisphosphonates especially injectable forms resulting in bone damage of various severity.  If the bump continues to become bothersome, have an image and evaluation."

    "dialogue": "Rootcanalsuck: When I was 10 years old I had a slight trauma to the front right tooth #8 my sister during horseplay I guess hit my tooth with a remote and it chipped exposing the pulp I guess so I had to get a root canal. Flash forward To when I was about 13(also around the time I got braces)  I get a little what I now know is called a fistula above my #7 and it would wax and wane and I guess disappear at times, one time I went to my pediatric dentist and asked him about it and I believe he said it could be a bone fragment or something but it was fine for now because I wasn’t in any pain or anything, now I’m 20 years old and the bubble came back recently and this time it felt different and didn’t really hurt but it was draining a lot daily and I wanted it gone so I went to a new dentist who my parents had said they liked so I went there and they performed a root canal on #7 next time I go there I still have the fistula and then they take a 3D scan of my head and what I saw was bad looking, it looked like a big oval of darkness above #7 and #8, then I am referred to an oral surgeon who at first gives me some regular antibiotics and then another course of stronger antibiotics I believe it was called clavulanic acid and amoxicillin or something. Fistula still looks the same as it has if not worse, so I have the apicoectomy performed on 7,8 at the same time. 3 months later I have noticed that there is another big pimple looking thing starting to grow, what is my next option ? Should I just get it extracted and put implants i don’t have any X-rays yet but hopefully will soon these pictures are in chronological order, first one is like 6 days after the apico MattKW: Xrays before RCT, after RCT, before apico, and after apico would be helpful to see how the history developed, and to give you a fair idea of prognosis. Sounds like the oral surgeon did the apicocectomy? Not the best people to do them, better to be done by endodontist. Implants are not necessarily the easy next step because you will probably have had significant bone loss. Rootcanalsuck: I don’t have those at the moment but I will see about getting them as they are from 10 years ago, could you tell me anything based upon the pictures I posted going back to the surgeon to see what he says on Monday I’m not in paid so am I okay? MattKW: You appear to have recurrent abscesses. Apicos have a significant failure rate. Rootcanalsuck: Yeah I was aware of this, just got back from the doctor gave me amoxicillin and told me he wants to go back in, just took this X-ray today ... any suggestions... should I get a second opinion from another doctor... any reccomondations are aprreciated MattKW: Rootcanalsuck said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tYeah I was aware of this, just got back from the doctor gave me amoxicillin and told me he wants to go back in, just took this X-ray today ... any suggestions... should I get a second opinion from another doctor... any reccomondations are aprreciated\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nI wouldn't revisit an oral surgeon. If you want to really assess the chances of success, then see an endodontist. Your xray shows a couple of problems with heavy-handed apicos: the initial damage to the tooth was when you were young and the canals were large (hard to root-fill), the apices have been opened up widely following the apico, so more foreign material for the body to try to counteract, and there's no apparent end sealant to the apicos - an endodontist would prob use some MTA. i don't like your chances, but an endodontist is the best person to consult. Rootcanalsuck: Can you elaborate on “heavy handed” Apicos, I was expecting to see a little hole where he drilled through bone? I can’t tell so does it look like he did that? And because the tooth has been in my mouth for so long and never got capped or anything is that possibly why I have this problem to begin, also if I go to an endodontist will they treat me after I had the apico done by another surgeon? MattKW: Rootcanalsuck said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCan you elaborate on “heavy handed” Apicos, I was expecting to see a little hole where he drilled through bone? I can’t tell so does it look like he did that?

And there doesn't appear to be any sealing of the apex. In the old days, amalgam was used to seal the apex; it worked reasonably. I did plenty of those myself. Nowadays, an endodontist would remove a very tiny tip of the root, and seal up with a more biocompatible material like MTA. \n\nThe lack of a cap (crown) is not significant in your case. It would not have given much benefit as there's not much tooth structure in young teeth. On the plus side, it also means that without a crown, an endodontist will be able to more easily get into the canal from the mouth end if necessary,\nThe bone heals over in most cases. In your case, the bone is thin because of the recurrent infection - that's why you have a gum swelling.\nYou have nothing to lose by seeing an endodontist. Their techniques have improved so much over my lifetime. That's why i'd never use an OS for an apico. Rootcanalsuck: Thank you so much for all the responses, this is just a scary time in my life as I’m only 20 years old and pretty self conscious about having missing teeth possibly in the future or if this problem never goes away because of the extent it has gone on. I’m afraid it’s going to spread to the adjacent teeth or something. But anyways I will see an endodontist and see what they say."

If the RCT was done by a general dentist, then retreatment should be done by a specialist. Apicocectomies are a very last resort because they don't often address the problem of contaminated canals, and they weaken the teeth; should only be done by an endodontist, not a general dentist or oral surgeon.

The surgeon looks at it and first says “looks ok”, then looks closer and says partial dry socket. He took stitches out and irrigated with water and advised that 20 minutes after he applies clove med I will feel better and I will need to return for more packing in a day or two.\n\nNow here is the PROBLEM:  The whole was too small for him to pack the soaked gauze to stay.

(Plastic surgery)  I recently decided that I want to have it taken out and was shocked when I began reading about bone erosion being common with these impants - particularly when they are large and incorrectly placed high on the aleovar bone as mine is (it is also off center with more of the mass to the upper right of the midline)\nUpon pulling down my lower lip I notice that I have signifcant recession of the gingiva/mucosa in the vestibule which would indicate bone erosion and I think there is a good chance it is at the tooth roots though I have no sensitivity at this point.\n\nI read an instance online where a mandibular advancement was suggested in a case such as mine - my jaw/bite alignment is already correct thus a mandibular advancement alone would not work it would have to be double jaw surgery and this is something I can't do at this point in my life (44 single parent with special needs child).  However, I would think the only reason any  type of jaw advancement would be prescribed in my  instance where jaw/bite  alignment is already correct this would be to assist with the aesthetic damage of the bone recession after removing the implant although even in moving the jaw forward the mand symphysis bone erosion would still be present which is the crux of my question:\n\n*In an instance of significant mandibular symphysis erosion is the standard treatment bone grafting assuming proper existing jaw/bite alignment already exists?  Also, can synthetic bone grafting or bone paste be used or would it need to be actual bone?\n\n*I do understand that no diagnosis can be made over the web and without x-rays - I was just hoping to learn for discussion purposes and will be pursuing x-rays.  Thanks to all of the great contributors here MattKW: It's not clear that you actually have bone erosion as a result of the implant. It is more frequent that gum recession simply occurs from periodontal or hygiene issues. You may require no treatment at all, or possibly a skin graft. Before you get too worked up over this, I'd go see a dentist and then possibly a periodontist. JoeR1234: Thanks Matt - you are correct in terms of how stressed I am.  I will do as you mention here"

Often there are space issues and placement of 3 implants can cause the implants to be too close to each other.  This can make the new crowns and gums appear not natural.  We often suggest placement of two implants in the lateral incisor positions and splinting a 3 unit bridge across.  The lab technician can mimic the illusion of 3 teeth much easier with this setup.

I thought my  teeth 14,15,16 are not front teeth  as they  are on the R-H side of my upper  jaw.\n      So I would have an implant to replace nr 14,    nr 15 would be a bridge   and   16 an implant\n      instead of  all 3 implants as per my request.\n\n2.  And as far as my R-H lower jaw is concerned the two teeth to be taken out are really big, so I thought placing \n     two implants would be ok?\n\nThe oral surgeon said there would be oral surgeons who would do what I want, but she thinks what she is doing is exactly what I need. MattKW: I think Ferber might not realise the notation system you're using, which is FDI. However, they are correct that only 2 implants would be required to replace the 14, 15, and 16. \nFor normal functioning, it is only necessary to have a single molar in each quadrant. Placing implants farther back for 2nd molars is more complicated because the bone gets thinner, and you are closer to major structures. barona: Thank you MattKW.

The current estimate to fix my mouth in the USA is about $100,000 ... In India it would be about $30,000... I don't have $100,000 and it will take ages to save up that much money. But there are also things that worry me about going to India. I need major work and if the doctors dont know what they're doing, I'm screwed. Also if the doctors ripped me off in any kind of way, just to get my money and only half do the services, I'm screwed. Likewise if anything happens after the surgery, there's no recourse and I would also be forced to find a local remedy. I'm also not sure how things like prescription work either or what happens when I run out...lastly is also the state of the world in general...I could end up finding myself stuck there.\n\nWhat do you feel? Should I go overseas and have it done or hope by some miracle I can come up with 100 grand so I can chew again? Busybee: If you go overseas try somewhere like Hungary rather than India. In India the healthcare market tends to be less regulated than in the West and the consumer protection will leave you more exposed if something goes wrong.  They tend to be more daring in experimental treatments but such treatments aren't yet tested.   A friend had poor implant treatment in the UK but his teeth were fixed in Hungary.    As Hungary is in the EU there are certain safety standards.  Hungary should be a lot cheaper than the US. MattKW: Start by getting an assessment of the risks of surgery and likely failure in the US. Then that's your benchmark of what you'll be up against in another less developed country. If it's high risk in US, it'll be even higher elsewhere.\nGoing OS for any complicated treatment is fraught with risks. Apart from quality risks, these are usually short-term trips that don't allow for proper observation of healing and taking care of any complications. And if you get back to the US, and the surgeons aren't satisfied with the workmanship, they're not going to want to take on your case to fix it. Look for simpler options than full implant retained prosthesis. Consider 2-implant or at most 4-implant supported dentures. US patients tend to go to Mexico; Australians tend to go to Thailand; UKs tend to go to Hungary. All are risky - you'll never go back for any problems that might arise."

That was after a month and a half wait from when the agonizing pain started (decay and infection under a filling, touching a nerve and causing bone recession). I was on antibiotics the entire time. The extraction was easy, came out in one piece, and the oral surgeon had me stop the antibiotics. \n\nOn Saturday (day 3) I noticed I was still in as much pain as when the novacaine wore off. I called the surgeon and he had me restart antibiotics. Now I'm at day 5 and it's slightly better, but I'm still living on 800 mg ibuprofen round the clock, and an extra painkiller as needed.\n\nI've had a dry socket before and I thought it would hurt more, but maybe I've been in pain so long it just feels the same?\n\nDoes this look like dry socket? I've been following all instructions to the letter, I don't smoke, I've not had hot liquids, etc. \n\nIf it's not dry socket, is there any reason to still be in pain? honestdoc: Dry socket is when the extraction site loses its clot and bone is exposed.

Its always recommended to have tooth or one side (right or left) extracted on one day and then wait for it to heal,before you extract the other side.

The implant goes in first, then a screwed abutment, and then a crown is the top part. The crown is either cemented on the abutment, or screwed in as part of the abutment. From the Bicon website, it appears that their crowns for molars is cemented on the abutment. So the crown would have to be drilled off the abutment; the implant remains untouched. Aloviva: First of all I just want to say thank you for your time and replies.\nThis is the situation.\nMy first dentist who did the implant told me that he couldn’t replace the crown as he tried to knock it off (literally). He explained that this implant is type of a cone which goes on the top of abutment( not screwed or cemented) . After couple attempts of removing it he just gave up. I went to another  doctor who couldn’t understand why the crown not cemented or screwed( he said he’ve never worked with implants like that before and asked me to bring the medical journal from this doctor to see what kind of the implant is  there).Because of this type of the implant if he removes the crown he wouldn’t unfortunately be able to replace just the crown as they don’t work with this type of  the implant here . Then he has to do the whole process again( whole the new implant) And I don’t know what to do as I am worried if he starts to remove it it could damage the other tooth as it’s too close to it. And implant itself sits quite tight. I really appreciate your help and thank you so much for your answers. MattKW: Aloviva said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFirst of all I just want to say thank you for your time and replies.\nThis is the situation.\nMy first dentist who did the implant told me that he couldn’t replace the crown ......\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense, and I've been to the Bicon website where they have the Manuals and Catalogues available for download, so I don't think your dentists have even looked. \nIf you try to remove the whole implant, you are going to lose a chunk of good bone.\nAnyway, other options are:\n\nContact Bicon and find out who they might sell their product to from their invoices. Maybe you can find a dentist in your area who uses it. Maybe they can even advise your dentists about how to retrieve this situation.\n\nFailing that, it would be possible to drill off the extra crown and leave the one on the abutment. Clumsy, and a bit of a pain, but at least that'll stop the excessive forces, and if all goes well you might be able to get another implant squeezed in the gap. Aloviva: You are right ( I suspect that the first dentist is not that good with the implants after all ).thats why I am frustrated and feel totally helpless in this situation. I tried to contact several implantologist  in the area but none of them use Bicon and they even never heard of this brand /type of the implant. Do you think if I just  leave the situation as it ( slight wobbly crown) and wouldn’t go with the solution of the second dentist, will it do damage to my bone in  the future?

If the implant gums are in good health, then I have to assume either the crown or abutment is loose. Maybe one of those components will come out by itself over time, and then you could look at redoing it; maybe your dentist could reduce the height of the crowns for now so they don't bother you. Ok, see what happens. It can't be worse than trying to take out the implant. Aloviva: Thanks again for your advices ."

There is a risk of damage to the nerve when the 37 is removed, but a surgeon should be OK with that.\nThe 47 he's just started working on will be useless when the 17 and 18 are removed, so don't waste any more time and money on it.\nDo the extractions ASAP before the roots of 18, 28, 38, and 48 finish development.

It is very rare to unheard of for a 5 year old to have SCC.   According to various sources, a possible lesion similar to the one in the image has a ~97% chance of resolving with no mitigating factors such as irritation, trauma, medications & supplements, or special diet/beverages.\nIt's is hard to determine from the image but another possibility is the eruption of the adult incisor.   I do have a 5 year old at home and if this was in her mouth, I would continue to watch it and monitor for possible mitigating factors."

I'm not having any sensitivity to cold air or water and the sockets themselves aren't hurting more than usual. Is this normal or could it be the start of dry socket even though blood clots are still in place or something else? MattKW: Too early to say.

Three attempts to remove it have failed. It's long (15-17mm) and well osseointegrated. I don't want to remove and replace it! I also am not keen on giving up on it and having it embedded with a gum graft and having a resin bonded bridge over the top, as I'm worried about the adjacent teeth having to be shaved down and overloaded. \n\nDoes anyone know of anyone who's done this work - in Australia or overseas? Or can you suggest where I can start looking? \n\nThank you!!! MattKW: I can't see you have any option but to remove it. Implants are made to extremely tight tolerances and you can't repair them. Have you been to a prosthodontist to have the screw removed, or is it a general dentist? A prosdo might also have other ideas about how to replace the implant rather than a resin-bonded bridge (used in rare circumstances). The company reps for the implants are often very helpful, and know people who might also be able to help. SeekingASolution: Many thanks for the reply. \n\nInitially I went to the general dentist who placed the implant, then to a prosthodontist who recommended either a new implant or a bridge. He may have only recommended the bridge because I said I didn't want another implant. So I came to the same conclusion - it would need to be removed. Then I saw a periodontist for an unrelated area, and he considered a new implant a 'challenging non-pragmatic option' because of the length (15-17mm) and its osseointegration. I was reluctant anyway so this started me looking for alternatives, and I read many articles about fractured screw removal techniques, and a few about a post and core approach. \n\nI have also contacted Neoss and am hoping they will get back to me.\n\nIn the meantime I will keep looking!"

    "dialogue": "Trudijane: A month ago, my upper right molar Implant failed due to an infection.  I also had the most ungodly pain prior to it being pulled by my periodontist.  It was after I got billed for the removal of the implant that got me upset - as I did not expect that at all.  And, here is why.\n\n2 years ago, I lost my upper left implant.  Shortly after it was put in, my dentist discovered a hole in my gum through which you could see the screw of the implant.  Long story short, my periodontist spent close to a year of trying to repair it saying at first it would be a cinch to do.  It turned out to be a nightmare of procedures, surgeries, mistakes and healing.  Ultimately, I couldn't stand it anymore and neither could he - so I lost that implant and he did not want to replace it because of all the problems with it.\n\nHe no longer uses this brand, but he said he was watching another tooth (same brand) on the upper right molar since it was the same brand.  2 months ago, I developed a horrible infection with unbearable pain and it took his colleague (after a CT scan) to see what the cause of the pain was.  There was all this infectious material beneath the implant - so it had to be pulled once again.\n\nSo now I have these 2 big gaps on both my left & right side after paying a lot of money for both.  I guess he felt responsible for the first implant failing and the need for it to be pulled - but then why in the world would he bill me for pulling out the 2nd failed implant? I made in clear that I paid for these 2 implants in good faith, and both of them had failed and I wondered why he billed me for pulling out one implant yet not the other.  I AM paying for it - because I really don't want to get into any legal issues, but I am still mad & upset about it - but mostly because of the 2 failed implants ...I'm not even sure how to chew with 2 huge gaps on both sides of my mouth.\n\nHe said it actually cost a lot more (all the procedures and all) so he  made it sound like he gave me a huge discount.  I really like this guy, but he is now semi-retired and maybe he's losing it or something ... I don't know.  But to charge me for pulling yet again another failed implant doesn't seem right or ethical.\n\nEventually, I would like to have the implant replaced (with another brand).  What are my rights here???\n\nThank you. MattKW: You'd have to talk to local regulatory body or consumer board. You would most likely have to get all records and get a second opinion from someone with a high reputation - the regulator may be able to suggest someone. I can't tell you here if it's something the manufacturer did, that the periodontist did, or that even yourself did was wrong. Sometimes things just fail for no apparent reason. So talk to someone and gather the data. SeekingASolution: Ouch!!! I really feel for you! Sounds like an awful time  \nI have had a problem with an implant having a fractured screw, and I did what Matt suggested - I gathered as much information as I could, and got other opinions from another dentist, and prosthodontists. I also spoke to my sister who's a lawyer. I then spoke to the dentist who placed the implant, and he agreed to refund me for the cost of the implant. I felt bad for asking but someone told me it's likely he would have insurance to cover it. But that's just my experience, as a non-professional. I think Matt's advice is sound - especially since you allude to mistakes being made in the treatment of your first implant..."

A few days ago after using the syringe to clean out my right socket, I noticed a lump on the inside of my cheek.

    "dialogue": "PositiveCopy: Around 2 weeks ago I had a very nervous patient enter the clinic for the extraction of a broken down LL8. The patient had not eaten all day so we provided them with a glucose drink pre-treatment. Although the patient was nervous (taking many deep breaths during initial examination), he said he was comfortable enough and happy to undergo the treatment. I administered the LA (Left ID block followed by a long buccal infiltration) and waited around 5-10 minutes for full anaesthesia to be achieved. Once the patient was fully numb and I was just about to perform the extraction, he suddenly experienced vasovagal syncope and lost consciousness for around 20 seconds. Thankfully this was spotted the second it happened and was managed immediately. The patient quickly recovered but still felt slightly uneasy and anxious for a good while after the incident. We therefore decided alongside the patient to postpone the treatment to another day and ensure he left with an escort. I know it is difficult to say, but is it likely that this event was caused by the local anaesthetic (there was no flashback on aspiration and the event occurred at least 10 minutes after the ID block) or was this more likely due to a combination of the stress, hot weather and lack of food pre-treatment? MattKW: [QUOTE=\" or was this more likely due to a combination of the stress, hot weather and lack of food pre-treatment?[/QUOTE]\nYes, it won't be the LA. Some of these patients haven't been eating or sleeping well for several days, plus taking lots of analgesics, and generally working themselves up in a lather. It was good that you gave him a glucose drink pre-op, and the escort home. I've had a few who faint pre-op because the pain has been relieved by the LA, although most faint post-op. I had one fellow faint before I even started, just at the quote! Maybe this fellow would benefit from nitrous (or even IV) sedation next time. If he's not in great pain, then an OPG might allow you to assess if other wisdoms need extraction and a GA might be better suited."

    "dialogue": "Giselle21: Hi, this is my first post here, female, 24 yo. So I went to the dentist last week to get my upper left wisdom tooth removed (very back down there, so I couldn’t see it but I could feel it when I touched the gum). After taking a panoramic dental x-ray, there were actually 3 of them (the other 2 are bottom wisdom teeth)! *Gasp*. I opted to only have my upper left wisdom tooth removed in that visit, and planned to have the other two removed next month.\n\nAfter having the tooth removed, I didn’t feel any substantial pain as I obediently put my gauze, took my meds and ate porridge a couple of hours after the procedure. Fast forward a couple of days, I felt the string of the stitch dangling over the removal place, but I couldn’t be sure whether it was the stitch went loose or it was only the end-tail of the stitch. Of course, I couldn’t brush that specific location and so I only gargle with salt water and the prescribed mouthwash by the doctor. Thing is, I felt that there were food pieces there, but I couldn’t check for sure since it was way too far down there. When I feel the location with my finger (a clean one, of course) there was a bad smell, but no slightest pain at all.\n\nFast forward one week (now), the location isn’t painful at all. I can even brush the location very, very carefully already and it doesn’t feel painful or bleed at all. But that location still smells bad and when I feel my way along the gum, I feel that the gum doesn’t seem to close (it feels hard, not soft like gums should be). I worry that it may be a dry socket, but why doesn’t it feel painful at all? And what about the bad smell that specific location emits?\n\nCan anybody give me some insight about whether this is normal or not, because I really worry if I have a dry socket. Also I worry that the gum won’t close soon and the root of the tooth beside it will be uncovered for an unhealthy time.\n\nNote: Due to my schedule I can only go to the dentist at least two weeks from now, and I don’t have access to syringes or Waterpiks like some will suggest. Any insights will be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Uptown101: The cause of bad breath after a tooth removal is the flow of blood. The extraction site may have occasional bleeding for first two days which can cause both an odor and an unpleasant taste in your mouth. This blood clot and lack of refreshment is the first reason to cause bad breath after tooth extraction. Stay hydrated to get  rid this type of bad breath. Consume fresh juice to keep your body hydrated and eat healthy foods. \n\nHope this helps!"

Have seen an orthonditist who's said I'll need surgery to take out teeth to put braces on due to overcrowding.  My teeth aren't in the best shape.  I don't know where to begin with my treatment. Can you put braces on teeth that aren't fantastically  healthy? MattKW: Well, there has to be no active decay underway, so first you need to get everything in order before starting ortho. It would also depend which teeth the ortho wanted extracted - there's no need to fix up any decay in those particular teeth. Other things might matter too, like the ortho will not want you to have crowns or veneers placed until after his treatment. I'd get a treatment plan from a dentist, and then cross-check it with what the ortho wants to do. Uptown101: The first step is getting a referral, usually from a dentist. Your first meeting with the orthodontist will be the consultation. He will look at your teeth and determine what needs to be done in order to straighten your teeth, or if you would even benefit from an orthodontic treatment. After the consultation, the orthodontist will design a treatment that is specific to your needs. Not every person has an underbite or an overbite,and not every person has gaps in their teeth or overcrowding. This initial appointment will be much longer than any of the future appointments. It involves conditioning the surface of the teeth, to provide a place to cement on the brackets, cementing the brackets in place, and placing the first wire."

If your dentist is not concerned and it doesn't hurt then don't worry about it.   As far as I know cancerous lesions are more likely to be white, black or a growth (a noticeable lump).   Your dentist knows what to look for.   If you are really worried pay to have a biopsy just to put your mind at rest.   \n\nBut I will just repeat that you should definitely give up smoking because that's really bad for both your oral health and your overall health. aqz: @Busybee hi thanks for ur message, i know i should give up the smoking i am trying so hard. My question is why is redness not going away and some days its more red then others. That must be something sinister? I posted on dental twins but they have only peaked my anxiety even more raising all sorts of questions. My just at my wits end and want to feel normal again. Busybee: If you breathe through the mouth then you might not be getting enough saliva to the area.   This isn't great for your oral health.   Combined with smoking it's not a healthy mix. MattKW: Doesn't appear sinister, but looks more like smoking-related irritation due to the hot gases as you inhale; as you dentist suggests. Most cancers of the mouth are on the floor of the mouth (under the tongue), or side of the tongue where the carcinogens sit in the saliva. aqz: @MattKW thanks for your response, its been on and off for months now hence why i am concerned. Could my mouth becouse of deviated septum be causing it too? MattKW: No. Septa have nothing to do with it. aqz: @MattKW ok thanks. I am always rubbing area with tongue now becouse of being anxious. I dont know if that is making it worse. It doesnt hurt what should i do now? aqz: @Busybee thanks for your kind words and advice. aqz: @Busybee @MattKW this morning it looks better this is what i mean it comes and goes. MattKW: Maybe because you can't smoke when you're asleep. Leave it alone and stop rubbing it. aqz: erythroplakia is that what it is? @MattKW Busybee: Have you tried to seek help in giving up the smoking habit?  I know how addictive it is and I gave up many years ago after trying many times.   But giving up makes so much difference to your oral health.   I used to get mouth ulcers every now and then and none since giving up. It's really not worth risking your health.  Do try to get some help.  I used patches, it wasn't easy but you have to want to do it.    This lesion is nothing compared to what you are doing to your lungs etc.  Please go to your doctor and ask for support. aqz: @Busybee i knoww i am trying too, it doesnt help when my anxiety is through the roof at same time. Its the only thing that seems to keep me calm at the time. But i know i have to give up this horrible habit before its too late... thank you so much for your kind and supportive words means alot. Sometimes your nearest and dearest cant understand what your going through. But a stranger can so ironic. Thank you once again.x Busybee: Well Nicotine is a stimulant so it won't calm anxiety!

I have all of my other teeth but got an acrylic partial denture with no metal just with one tooth on and was going to get an implant within the next year. Would just leaving the gap until the implant is placed have any long term adverse effects or would it be advisable to wear the denture? MattKW: If you've had wisdoms removed (or not present), the it's unlikely you'll get any closure of the 15 gap (FDI; or UR5). Usually the 1st and 2nd molars interlock quite well with opposing teeth to stop any movement. One-tooth dentures can be such a pain.

    "dialogue": "Dental Impatient: I had an extraction on tooth 19. I am scheduled for an implant a month from now. I have a notoriously bad bite. My teeth don't touch each other in the front. They do in the back, but in an odd way that's developed over the years. I grind them a lot too, especially at night. My current dentist is not wanting to put a crown on it until my bite is sorted out, but that procedure is extremely expensive and could expose other issues (possible root canals, crown replacements) that will add to the cost. Is it a legitimate danger to put a crown on an implant in this situation? Can it really jar the implant? Should I even be getting one? I don't want to get to the point where I need a bone graft if I decide I want one later. MattKW: Too hard to say for sure. Generally it should be OK to put an implant back there; you're simply replacing what was there before. But, once you do the implant, you may not be able to later change your bite because it will \"lock\" in your current position. Why not get a 2nd or 3rd opinion? Dental Impatient: Can you explain what you mean by lock in the current position? Wouldn't the bite depend on the shape of the crown placed? MattKW: Orthodontics will move teeth because there is a fibre connection to the bone. An implant forms a direct bone connection, no fibres, so cannot be moved later by ortho. My daughter was missing 2 teeth by chance, had ortho to make proper spaces, then had 2 implants. The orthodontist then used the implants as anchors to finalise the job. So if you're happy with your bite, or don't like the risks or cost of the suggested treatment, then look at doing the implant as the final solution. I'd still suggest you get proper 2nd or 3rd opinions before making any decision. Dental Impatient: I see. So orthodontics becomes a lot trickier once I start getting implants. I've never been interested in ortho, it was never recommended to me as a child, and I've heard a lot of bad stories about invisiliign. I've had a couple of grand bite fixing strategies thrown at me, but both have involved crowns/building up or down teeth. I guess that either means my bite is so bad that there's no way to tell if ortho will help, or my teeth don't need it. Liza: How mush cost of dental implant? BeenThere: I've seen ads in my area for $4,000 to $20,000 (it costs the higher amounts if you need bone grafts), and other ads for $2,000 (but, I suspect those may only be part of the total cost involved -- I'd be Very Dubious about what they're providing for just $2,000 -- it's also something of a specialty, I'd be apprehensive about a dentist doing implants and would have a higher comfort level with a specialist). \n\nIn your area, estimates may be free or quite inexpensive (so, you may be able to readily get two or three estimates to get a sense of the cost).  Your dentist knows you and what's likely needed, it's a common topic, so your dentist ought to be able to provide a rough local cost estimate or a referral to one or two specialists doing implants in your area so they can advise you.  \n\nI was reading up on implants earlier today:  Did you know?  about 4% of patients are allergic to the titanium used -- it might be worth getting a specialty allergy test before going ahead with an implant procedure (as an allergic response to the metal could greatly contribute to implant failure)."

I also have stronger pain meds that I am resisting taking.. Pain is a symptom of something wrong, right?.\n\nThe side of my face from my nose up to my eye hurts, not a lot of swelling and no skin heat on the sinus. Im generally feeling sort of sick..Not getting better. I had a follow up with the periodontist, took some pics, said everything looks good and is healing properly. He would only be worried if there was increasing swelling up the side of the face, which he says is not the case. He says to keep taking the pain meds.\n\nBehind his back, I went to ENT MD I knew and he said that the Plavix- an antiplatelet - should have been a consideration before going under the drill. The blood is not coagulating as it should, and the med is causing the blood to pool above the bone in the sinus area. Its not draining properly. He said the danger of an infection is greater, and he gave me an antibiotic to take-Cefuroxime..\n\nIf anybody has any insight into this, I would greatly appreciate some feedback. MattKW: You shouldn't be taking ibuprofen in addition to the Plavix, so stop that now and go to acetaminophen. Plavix is not an absolute contraindication to dental surgery (which is what your ENT friend said, \"a consideration\"). Did the perio know you were taking Plavix, and did he tell you to take ibuprofen for pain relief? Either go back to the perio, or go for a proper consultation with an ENT so you can arrange tests or scans."

    "dialogue": "baplove: Hi guys! I literally have no one who can give me substantial advice about this so I’m taking it to the internet. So the (long) backstory is I'm 17, I had four impacted wisdom teeth and I got them taken out on April 5th (four weeks and one day ago). My surgeon put dissolvable stitches where my bottom two teeth were. Fast forward to Monday, April 16th, I had my check-up. I went in and my surgeon looked at my gums and said they were healing great and he didn’t need to irrigate them or anything. \n\nBy then I thought I was home free. WRONG! SO fast forward AGAIN to Friday, April 20th, my left bottom side of my mouth was hurting pretty bad and I could barely go to sleep. It hurt all of Saturday and it started swelling up and hurting really bad Saturday (April 21) afternoon. (This is where it gets pretty gross so stop reading if you get queasy easily) So when I looked inside of my mouth I could tell it was really swollen, I could barely close my mouth because the inside of my cheek and my gums were so swollen. I couldn’t press my teeth together without biting the swollen tissue. So by then I had done my own research and concluded that it was probably infected. There was a little cut on the inside of my cheek because it was so swollen I think I bit it a little and I poked at the area and some puss and blood came out… so definitely infected. But what worried me about this was that it was a couple centimeters away from where the stitches were, I read a lot of other people’s experiences having an infection after wisdom teeth removal but nobody says where in their mouth the infection actually is. I would think it is supposed to be right where the tooth was removed but that wasn’t the case for me? \n\nMy mom called the doctor on call and I took all of the ones they gave me. On April 23 I went in to see my oral surgeon so he could take a look at my mouth. He irrigated where the stitches used to be (they had dissolved by then and the gums were almost all the way healed over). He also said that the antibiotics should do the trick and if they don’t and it gets infected again he’ll probably have to reopen the area and clean out the hole (idk what to call it sorry). I can’t remember exactly what day I finished the antibiotics, I think it was April 28th or 29th. The day after I took the first antibiotic pill the swollenness went down and it didn’t hurt anymore, and it hasn’t hurt since. \n\nHowever, the problem I’m having is that I’m worried the infection is still there. I think this because I sometimes still taste puss in my mouth (I know, gross) and I was looking back at the area today (Almost a whole month after the surgery) and I didn’t notice it before because the inside of my cheek covers it but there’s a little hole at the bottom of my back molar on the outer side, and when I pressed near it more puss came out. It also comes out some along the edges of my gums on the outer side of the molar, the same way it did when I originally had the infection. It literally makes me so grossed out thinking about it. I don’t want to go back to my surgeon if it’s actually nothing because I’m so busy with exams and schoolwork right now. However, I read a lot of people’s experiences with infections in their mouth and about abscess and things of that nature and I’m afraid the infection is under my molar and it’ll stay there in my mouth for months on end until it rots my teeth out (I know that sounds dramatic but that’s actually what I’m really worried about). Anyone who is still reading thank you, I’m sorry for so many words but I hope someone can give me some advice on this or can let me know if they have experienced the same thing, thank you! MattKW: Hard to say. If there's any pus coming out, then \" better out then in\". But I doubt it's really pus at this stage if your swelling has subsided and the pain has gone. You've probably got a decent bony defect which might be collecting food debris. I wouldn't be too concerned unless it worsens (pain/swelling)."

The gums hurt almost non stop and are super sensitive. It is definetely not dry socket as both healed up quickly. I switched dentists and she x rayed it and said theres no infection and it shouldnt be hurting. I rinse with salt water all the time and take excellent care of my mouth.

My dentist said he would just pull my tooth for $100 but the oral surgeon want to put me to sleep and charge me 6 or 7 hundred dollars for  anesthesia. I have 1/3 of my teeth pulled and some by oral surgeon but not one dentist wanted to put me to sleep and I had some tough teeth to pull. I think this dentist should have his licence pulled. I told my dentist who is young and new and has a new business that if he doesn't want to lose patients not to send any more of his patients to him. So is this dentist a con man, am I living in an alternate universe, getting old and the law just doesn't care about people getting rip off, or is OKC just that way? MattKW: Depends upon a number of factors. I was trained in a surgical era, and happily taken out many wisdoms. However, many young patients now have no dental experience of needles, fillings, and so if they have 4 wisdoms to go, then I am more likely to send to OS for all simultaneously under GA. Also means they can deal with all suffering in one go, which might otherwise interfere with work or study commitments. I also use an OS who does LA, also has an IV setup, so he doesn't automatically give them all GA if he thinks they don't need it. Young dentists might also not be so willing to do oral surgery in these days of more litigation. This also affects my decision making - I work in a city, so have OS just around the corner, and it might be seen as silly if I take potentially unnecessary risks. In a country town with no OS, I'd do more surgery myself. Richard039: The factor is pulling 1 (one) Tooth. If you have no training in needles then you have no business being a dentist in the first place. I'm not taking about 4 teeth, I'm talking about 1 (one). I'm not taking about young dentists might also not be so willing to do oral surgery, I'm talking about an oral surgeon. You have given to much information. I'm not sure if you understand my post. MattKW: Sorry if I gave you so much info that you were overwhelmed. I did have some difficulty understanding the exact point of your post, and the treatment being offered.

In those who have it, dry socket can be uncomfortable but easy to treat. Dry socket is a hole in the bone where the tooth has been removed. After a tooth is pulled, a blood clot forms in the socket to protect the bone and nerves underneath. Sometimes that clot can become dislodged or dissolve a couple of days after the extraction that leaves the bone and nerve exposed to air, food, fluid, and anything else that enters the mouth. This can lead to infection and severe pain that can last for many days."

We're working within a biological system, not a car, and many things can go wrong that are unexpected. That's why we talk about risks. You can't sue for an implant that fails if the dentist or whoever laid it all out for you, and performed their work to the level of their peers. You can sue if they do something patently stupid, like putting in implants without taking X-rays or similar. We take calculated risks all the time, like driving a car or crossing the road - but I wouldn't drive with a drunk. And legally, if I promised a patient a warranty, my insurer would not cover me.

But I can't think of a case where a Straumann implant failed. Their quality control is extremely good. Sometimes though, labs might mix a cheaper non-Straumann component with a true Straumann product, and that's asking for trouble.

Sometimes though, labs might mix a cheaper non-Straumann component with a true Straumann product, and that's asking for trouble. So always ask for Straumann components throughout, and ask for the barcodes that accompany each component. I scan all mine into the patient records, and give patients a copy themselves (I won't be around forever).\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\n\nExcellent, but most dentists use other brands...  not Straumann.  Is it cost?  Lack of salespeople?  Stupidity?  Usually if a product stands out, like chocolate ice cream, the word spreads and product sales grow. MattKW: Straumann can be costly. But you get what you pay for in most of life. Lucubrate: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tStraumann can be costly.

Why don't periodontists offer a selection of two or more for their patients?\n\nWhat goes wrong with an implant years later?  If it's rare, why don't all implant companies offer a loooooong warranty?\n\nWhen it goes bad, how does the patient know?  Or is it only an Xray diagnosis?  When whatever goes wrong, is it easily correctable?"

The doctors didn't know she was pregnant, I was born out of the womb with nearly a full set of teeth, 4 of which were impacted.\n\nFast forward 10 years down the road... My enamel was abnormally weak and brittle across all of my teeth. By age 15 all of it decayed, no enamel whatsoever left. My teeth were now bare, and rough and incurred serious decaying issues as well as bone loss. Also most of them were crooked and in short spent 10's of thousands of dollars among dentists trying to correct the issue but most did not want to touch me and referred me to another dentist or another specialist and generally it lead to alot of confusion between multiple dentists as to what needed to be done to correct my mouth...and absolutely nothing but a few cleanings were achieved\n\nBy 22 I began having abscesses in my molars\nBy 27 I began having excruciating pain from multiple teeth along with these abscesses and began having extractions done.\nConsulting among multiple dentists, all agreed my teeth were beyond repair and my best option was either dentures or a full mouth set of implants... issue is, the implants were going to cost over $80,000\n\nMedical nor Dental insurance did jack about covering any of it.. and I did not qualify for a care credit loan... so I was on my own and the abscesses kept coming until I finally made the decision to just accept Dentures...\n\nI had ALL of my teeth pulled but the dentist didn't tell me about several impacted teeth in my lower jaw that he thought he could just put dentures over... my lower jaw COLLAPSED -- the dental bone literally is now divided into two halves, one on each side of my cheek and almost nothing in the center.. I can push my tongue straight to my lips with absolutely impeding it.\n\nDue to the severe bone loss and especially the impacted teeth, the dentures did not work. The Dentist should have referred me to an oral surgeon who could have told me the effects the impacted teeth would have had on dentures before yanking all my teeth out... I got an attorney but he basically is doing absolutely nothing about it as its too complicated of a case.\n\nI am losing bone...and FAST... I have been without teeth for 7 months now, and my lower jaw is very brittle.\n\nOral Surgeons are telling me my only options at this point are implants as I do not have enough bone to support dentures. They also have to regraft my lower jaw after pulling the impacted teeth out.\n\nIn short... I am still looking at $80,000 ... just to emphasis as to how hopeless I am feeling about this situation -- After this happened, literally 2 weeks after the extractions I managed to find a second job. (I had been looking all year but one finally came to past.) I was working two jobs and making 6 figures and even at that rate I still had absolutely no chance at footing the dental bill along with my house, car, utilities, and student loans (whom refuse to defer over the situation.)... and the 2 job deal didn't work long, someone found out about my second job and became jealous and in short got me fired.\n\nAnyway what are my options, is there any thing else I can do?\n\nI really want my mouth fixed.\n\nI can show photos of my mouth if necessary but I will warn it does not look pretty so I won't post them unless it is condoned. MattKW: A few things about your post. Firstly, I noticed it appeared in a Christian forum in 2013. Secondly, the research shows that glucocorticoids during pregnancy have limited effects on a child (lots of women take it for asthma for example). Thirdly, if there are any dental defects, these are only related to the primary teeth (formed in utero), not the adult teeth (which start growing AFTER birth). I find your story non-credible. Vivek: Now this game... Okay first, I understand the whole dillema about not trusting someone online, especially a new forum member with absolutely no posts here on this site before. I created an account because I'm looking for a solution as to what I can do and for most of my life I have been keeping this issue pretty silent but its coming to a point where its just too difficult to deal with.\n\nI have trusting issues too, however; you're making a huge assumption based on very little evidence.\n\nFirst off,\nMy story does appear on a christian forum, but it was not 2013.. That was my JOIN DATE to the actual site - It was POSTED on August 4th 2017 right after the incident happened (top left corner of the post shows the date it was posted. The date that is under my Username is my Join Date.)\n\nLink: http://christianchat.com/prayer-req...ibly-wrong-incurs-major-toll.html#post3223012\n\nand regardless of how credible you may or may not believe it is it makes no difference to the fact that it happened and have dental records proving it from countless dentists who were unable to fix it. I am sitting here without a single tooth in my mouth and am living evidence that it can happen and have dental evidence of said occurrence.\n\nLastly, if you don't have have any constructive feedback, I really don't care about your opinion. I'm asking for help, not criticism.\n\nI should also re-itterate that I am not looking for donations, but I am trying to find another way if at all to fix my jaw\n\nEDIT: Vivek: For good measure, I even attached my dental records from my most recent dentist of which all of my teeth were extracted omitting all of my personal information (I basically used the snipping tool built into Windows to cut them out of the pdf document.)...\n\nAs stated before (post under moderation so you might not yet see it) My story does appear on a christian forum, but it was not 2013.. That was my JOIN DATE to the actual site - It was POSTED on August 4th 2017 right after the incident happened (top left corner of the post shows the date it was posted.

Becky: By way of background, spammers will often copy and paste forum posts so that they appear genuine, which I'm guessing is why @MattKW was suspicious. Sounds like you have been through a difficult time @Vivek and I hope you find the help you need. Vivek: I understand his concern but I can promise this situation is very real..and very frustrating as well.\n\nWhat I am very worried about right now is I am afraid my jaw bone has thinned to a point beyond repair and I'm hoping it hasn't come to that point. MattKW: I sincerely apologise for my reaction. I felt it was a spam/troll, and things didn't look right. I'll back out of this thread. Best of luck."

If you look at the 2018 xray for this week #17 is gone. I will look into a coronectomy. I was told I would need a surgery to straighten #18 because of the bone there to remove bone.. MattKW: Not sure about that. Maybe seek ortho opinion before doing any surgery for 19 and 17. Zuri Barniv: Have they considered orthodontically extruding #19? We do this with impacted teeth all the time. Busybee: Do dentists and neurosurgeons ever work together?  It's crazy that such a risky procedure should be carried out by anyone but the top specialists.   I do think that there should be more regulation of the profession when there are so many differing opinions and dental work is potentially life changing.   An MDT approach to some situations is appropriate and I don't mean just in a dental hospital. MattKW: Just wondering how you might achieve that with the wide crown and fully formed, complex roots on this tooth, and where the anchorage would come from? How sure would one be of success compared to simpler coronectomy, and later implant. Zuri Barniv: The point of an extrusion is to dramatically reduce the risk you speak of. You don't need a neurosurgeon for that, but you might involve one if you were removing the tooth. In the end of the day, it is up to a skilled surgeon and no amount of consultations is going to change the outcome in a meaningful way.

Worst case scenario it doesn't move, so you move on to something more invasive. Best case it is extruded even a little which would reduce risk overall the more it came out. Coronectomy is great assuming you don't develop an infection there, which would really mess things up. MattKW: If you wanted to simply remove the 19 surgically, then yes, it might be crazy and risky. But a coronectomy wouldn't be a problem for an oral surgeon or oral maxillo-facial surgeon (not sure what you have in USA). There is no need for a neurologist. I communicate regularly with all my specialist colleagues, and they work together on complex cases; they don't all have to be in the same institution. MattKW: Coronectomy carries about 5% risk of infection. I don't know the stats for TADs but it's got its own risks of screw fractures (putting in and taking out) plus bone damage, and it might not even work, and there's the cost.

But what is the right plan if dentists have so many different approaches?  It's the same as any other complex clinical procedure - a multidisciplinary approach gives move chance of a positive long term outcome.  Dissent leads to creativity, but as an individual you're not likely to disagree with yourself! MattKW: There can be a number of different approaches to all clinical matters. It doesn't mean they're all wrong, but that they carry different risks - that's what Zuri and I are discussing here. The same thing applies to a MDT, and different MDTs can have different suggestions too. For a patient, they may worry about costs, pain, success rates, aesthetics, ... if mangobanana gets some opinions from specialists, then I'm sure he/she will work it out. Zuri Barniv: I will tell you what I tell all my patients in these situations: start with the least risky option that has the greatest chance of success and go towards riskier options if the former ones don't work. Zuri Barniv: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCoronectomy carries about 5% risk of infection.

Can you image if that thing gets infected and now you HAVE to extract it? I wouldn't want my hand forced like that. And the risk of nerve damage when there is an active infection there is even higher. TADs have risk, but the risk is much lower. And if something goes wrong, it will be around the TAD...very far from that nerve. The biggest risk is cost, as you say. But with a highly complex and risky situation like this, I think cost should not even be a factor. You should do the least risky thing first, even if it might not work. MattKW: Good philosphy in general. What is the least risky option with best chance of success here? I think it's coronectomy overall. Zuri Barniv: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tGood philosphy in general.

It was infected. Afterwards I did everything right with the oral care regime. Tonight I noticed that it looks like white bone at the base inside the wound, what could this be? I don’t think it’s dry socket as I have had the misfortune to have one of those before and it was excruciating, the worse pain ever. I am in pain , but I seem to have toothache in every tooth now and paracetamols are no longer helping. I’m not due back at dentist now for six months. So, my questions are, what is the white bone in wound? Why have I go toothache in every tooth, could it just be down to the trauma of a terrible extraction? Thank you for taking the time to read this. Jgold07: I'm pretty sure the ache in the rest of your teeth was caused by the difficulty of the extraction. I'm in the same boat right now (sort of). I had an implant removed and it was very difficult for the oral surgeon to get it out. He had to do lots of tugging as well, which puts a lot of pressure on the jaw, making the rest of your teeth hurt and maybe the swelling also causes them to shift a bit too. Shifting will definitely cause aching. \n\nThe \"white bone\" might not be bone, but healing tissue. That's kind've what mine looks like right now. My surgeon said it was normal.\nBut I really don't know. I'm certainly no expert on these things. Lainey62: I am feeling loads better now. Yes the white stuff is just the soft tissue healing. Still in some discomfort but I no longer need the painkillers so that is a good sign. Sorry to hear you had a bad extraction though. Hope you feel better soon. Thank you for replying."

He said he would see how it looked and should be able to do the graft that day if it wasn't looking too bad.\n\nAfter numbing me up and opening up the area, he said it \"looked alright, just a bit irritated\"  and so proceeded with the bone graft. There'd been a lot of bone loss so he had to put a lot of the graft in there. After being sewed up, he sent me off with my prescriptions, one of which was my second course of amoxicillin for the month.\n\nIt's been nearly 6 days. Most of the swelling has gone down but there is some throbbing going on. I originally had throbbing and pressure similar to this 4 weeks ago when I first discovered something was wrong with the implant and the dentist found that it was slightly infected.\nI'm concerned about there still being infection up in there. Anyone here know if it's typical to have throbbing after a bone graft? Is this just the area healing and the graft  integrating? I have a follow up appointment for Wednesday but am having anxiety over this at the moment and hoping to find out if throbbing and mild on/off pain is typical.\n\nSorry for the wall of text."

    "dialogue": "Arman: Dear Members,\n\nDoes any of you know notable oral surgeons in Bay Area, CA who specialize in angulated implants? From what I understood these special types of implants (they have been recommended to me due absence of enough bone) are not as commonly placed as regular ones. I need to find an oral surgeon who does this on regular basis, because the success of the procedure highly depends on the skills of the surgeon which in my opinion highly depends on how often they perform this procedure. If you know of anyone, please kindly write their name so I can make an appointment with them.\n\nVery best regards,\nArman TallPoppy: Are angulated implants the ones that engage cortical bone? If so be cautious, heresay is that if they fail they fail quite disasterously.  Why, don't you have a tooth behind for a bridge? Stuff like monolith zirconia requires only half or one mm tooth reduction.  \n\nI kinda think if might be rare to find those who does those types (if I am correct) in usa let alone bay area. MattKW: Angulated implants bring their own set of risks; the manufacturers promote these types of things, but they don't take responsibility if they fail. I would seek a specialist prosthodontic opinion if you really want to explore this path. There may be other alternatives such as implant-supported dentures, or maybe you just aren't a suitable candidate for implants? Don't just keep going until you find someone who'll take you on. The best results come from specialists who take the least risks. My thought when treating people is always, \"Would I do this to my mother?\".

Sinus grafting comes with risks, such as possible infections in the future. The procedure I want to do is All-on-4, or All-on-6 if I want to do sinus grafting too. What do you think? MattKW: I understand. All implant surgery comes with risks, and you have to be fully informed to make a proper decision. It shouldn't be up to an oral surgeon to determine if you are suitable, it is primarily up to the restoring clinician because they have to determine where and how the implants come to the surface. They then communicate with an oral surgeon to see if he/she can make it work surgically. I strongly suggest you see a prosthodontist or two for opinions. I attach a snip I took of the first 2 names that came up on Google.  I'd like to hear how you get on, please. Best of luck.\nA few mins later... Arman, is that your OPG in the OS forum? If so, you have some serious problems with your existing dental work, and your natural lower front teeth appear to have periodontal disease."

It's lingual bone, and this sometimes happens. If it's wobbly, then OS can take it out easily with a bit of anaesthetic and firm tweezers; if it's firm, then need anaesthetic, push back tissue, and trim back, maybe with a Rongeurs."

The numbness has slowly intensified mostly in the lower front right teeth. The clinic informed me that this is not surprising given the proximity of the wisdom tooth to the mandibular nerve, which seems to either have been disturbed during surgery or affected by subsequent swelling/healing (although swelling is largely gone).\n\nJust wanted to see if anyone else had a similar experience so I can gain an idea of how long it will take for the numbness to return to normal and if the gradual worsening could become an issue (it hasn't been complete numbness, and the degree of numbness is stimulated by brushing teeth, moving jaw etc.. There has also been slight tingling, itching).\n\nMany thanks"

I checked earlier and found this white mass thing? is this the beginning stages of dry socket? please help, this has been the absolute worst tooth extraction  experience I've had thus far and I just want it over with. MattKW: No, looks more just like some sloughing tissue of no concern. You don't form dry scabs in the mouth because it's always wet, so you get this white appearance. A dry socket will have brown mucky stuff inside, smell terrible, taste crappy, and give you more pain than painkillers can tolerate. The good news is that they nearly always occur in lower teeth, in smokers. I'm guessing you're quite young and having extractions before braces? It is also very rare to have dry sockets in young people for these premolars."

I did go by the pharmacy to fill the rx's as per dentist prescribed. the prednisone provided no releif from tooth pain. I called my dentist the next day, informed the dentist that I received no pain releif and if I could receive a prescripton pain medication for dental pain releif. well,the dentist informed me that I should try naprosyn, motrin or tylenol for pain relief. I did not obtain releif from the over the counter suggested medication. I did take the prescribed predisone, peridex mouthwash and amoxicillin medication as prescribed\n3 weeks later I remain on amoxicillin,predisone, and still  taking the suggested over the counter pain medication still I remain in pain. I have an appointment with the same dentist to have tooth removed and a bone graft to be done in prep for an implant. I am wondering , since I did not receive any pain releif from the suggested over the counter medication and prescribed medication of amoxicillin peridex mouth wash and predisone , I am considering to canceling all my dentist appointment with this dentist and seek out another dentist. I am not a drug seeker, all I request is  a rx pain medication for the couple of days after the tooth extraction \nthis dentist I have been a patient for 5 years, I have never attempted to \"scam\" any sort of rx for pain. this dentist has a DEA license, he has no encoumbered license. I am wondering If I go ahead keel next weeks appointment, have the extraction , would I receive rx pain medication , or will I receive the suggestion to take over the counter med ? I am bit fustrated I receive no pain releif any suggestion? Robert Tucker: A little ball of cotton wool soaked in clove oil placed on the tooth? Stronger than mouthwash, I would think, and may give some pain relief.\n\nCan you not ask if he'll prescribe an analgesic? Can you not ask your medical doctor? If the procedure is going to involve trauma to a live nerve, tricyclic antidepressants can be very helpful. I think only a medical doctor can provide an off-licence prescription for these.\n\nNaprosyn, motrin or tylenol? Never tried naprosyn – Wikipedia says there's a risk of stomach ulcers. Strongest OTC painkiller mixture I've tried is 2x tablet of paracetemol 500mg with 8mg codeine phosphate and 2x tablet ibuprofen 200mg, all four tablets taken together. One shouldn't take any of them for more than 2 or 3 days – I can't take more than a couple of doses of codeine. Check all this with your pharmacist. sekagirl: well, dis the worst thing, got the extraction done, have been in pain/ sick eversince, dentist informed me he does not provide rx pain med, instructed me to take motrin took motrin as he suggested, been vomiting green bile since then. cancelled follow up appointment with dentist will not go to this dentist any more"

The procedure went well according to my dentist, no complications. And for the first 2 weeks everything seemed well, and I experienced little to no pain during this time.

I would describe the pain as both stinging (right where the tooth was extracted), and generally dull radiating pain that covers my entire right jaw.\n\nSo far I've been able to control the pain with ibuprofen/tylenol, but I'm worried that I'm taking too many (so far 4/day for 5 days straight). I'm also worried that in these 5 days since I started experiencing the pain, nothing has changed. It has gotten neither worse nor better.\n\nI went to see the dentist last night and he could find no reason for the pain.

In the end he suggested that my gum tissue may be a bit sensitive and the pain should go away in a few days.\n\nHas anyone experienced similar symptoms so late after a wisdom tooth extraction? What was the cause? This is my first one, so I don't really know what to expect. Busybee: Could be nothing or could be the nerve was affected by the extraction.   It's a potential complication which the dentist should be aware of."

    "dialogue": "Kimdutch: Hi everyone,  I had my 4 wisdom teeth and 2 molars extracted on Nov 22.  I developed an infection that threatened my airway and was admitted to ICU for 3 nights.  The pain was severe.  After I was discharged the pain didn't get better and a 2nd CT scan showed than an abcess had developed under my ear/neck/jaw.  It was surgically drained by my oral surgeon 1 week ago.  During most of this and persisting to today I have a 1/2 numb tongue as well as the inside gums on the bottom left (same side as the  abcess).  I mentioned it to the ICU doc/nurses, ER docs, my surgeon and no one seems concerned except for me.  I have limited jaw opening.  Better now.  At the worst I couldn't fit my medication between my teeth.  Now with heat and stretching I can fit 2 fingers.  I'm obviously getting very worried.  I do have some tingling in my tongue and it feels sometimes hot and sometimes ice cold.  My livelihood has been affected - I'm a teacher and talk for a living and my speech has been afftected.  I'm very fortunate to have great sick benefits and am on medical leave but am supposed to go back next week.  Any advice or suggestions about the numb tongue?  I don't recall it being numb right after the extraction so I'm hoping it's from all the swelling.  I see my surgeon again today.  Thanks. Busybee: I'm not a dentist but I do know that wisdom teeth extraction can sometimes affect the nerve which is close by.  Apparently can take a couple of months to fully recover.   As far as I know it's more likely to have complications if you have them extracted as an adult.  Other than that any infection will have some weird symptoms.  Try to focus on your recovery instead of dwelling on it because the medication could also be causing some strange sensations including anxiety.  I'm really sorry you're going through this by the way you really have had a rough time.   I do hope you have  a speedy recovery. Kimdutch: Thanks for your reply.  The surgeon explained that the nerve has been squished by all the swelling and it  would take some time for the feeling to come back fully.  I hope he's right.  I was scared to have my teeth extracted so I waited.  I'm 41 and put it off at least 15 years becasue they weren't causing any problems.  I'm still on antibiotics until the end of tomorrow - almost 2 weeks of them now.  I still cannot open my jaw very far without heat at stretching.  I hope that improves once the swelling goes down too.  He also explained that the abscess would have left s pocket of scar tissue that my body needs to figure out what to do with.  Right now it feels like a knot in my cheek."

So I went with the latter, thinking about aesthetics, occlusion and whatnot.\nI should probably mention that I'm a third year dental student myself so I fret about things as such haha\nNow that my teeth are perfectly aligned, he said that I needed a bone graft before the implants, which was to be expected given the bone resorption. However, I expected him to fill the resorbed area with some bio-oss and leave it a few months to heal.\nHe said that bio-oss on its own is not an option in my case and that I needed some bone from the chin area or the ramus.\nI'm looking to see if there is any way that I can go through the implantation process without needing an auto-graft because thinking about it terrifies me. I am not ready to go through all of the pain and the swelling that comes with it.\n\nP.S: I'm getting a panoramic and a CBCT soon so I should be able to provide pics as soon as I get them.\n\nThanks! padma: Can you post updates to your situation?

    "dialogue": "Lrdonovan40: I have a lengthy question. And may be to complex for you to answer. I kind of laugh to myself when I see people asking about 1 tooth. My son is 22 years old. At the age of 18 he was in a bicycle accident and avulsed eight teeth #8,9,10,11,22-26 which were replanted. He had root canal therapy on teeth # 8,9,10,11,22,23 and 26 as well as a lingual bar splinting, creating natural pontics for teeth #24 and 25. We were recently told that he now has both internal and external resorption noticed on recent full mouth series. We have had 3 consultations and they have all come up pretty much with the same plan. Extracting 7,8,9,10 11,22,23,26,27 and doing bone grafting then implants. Anyway we are talking over $50,000.00 worth of work. He has already had interim partial dentures made but realized that we wouldn't be able to go forward with the treatment. Therefore we have already spent $3000.00 and have nothing done. We have even been to Tufts Dental and Mass General Dental Schools to see if they could do the work cheaper but we were told it was to complex for the school. It is not possible to get a loan in that amount. We have no other means of obtaining the money for this. We don't know what other options we have. They consider this all cosmetic, so insurance does not cover any of it. My question is do you know of a way to have the work done pro-bono or any kinds of grants that may cover this?"

I told him I couldn't drive home like that. He then instructed his receptionist to call Urgent Care and said that I could drive myself there.  They told her that they could not take me if my eye was completely shut and that I needed to be seen in the emergency room.  I told him I could not drive myself there. He did end up driving me there ( he is also a personal friend from the gym).  They saw me right away and they took blood and gave me a CT scan of my head, face, neck, and gave me Zofran for nausea via I.V.  By this time, not only was my eye was  swollen completely shut but also the right side of my face and neck were swollen.  They told me it was Subcutaneous Emphysema.  I ended up driving myself home the 25 minute ride.  I spent 5 days in bed in horrific pain and watching my swollen face turn a brownish yellow color as the swelling finally went down.  I have to see him next week to have him look at the sutures.  I don't even think he put any of this in my chart!

I'm bipolar, and went 20+ year with depression, and my dental hygiene suffered. So far, I've had the bottoms done, and the top 8 on the right taken out. And every procedure is more painful than the last. And all this has been done over the course of 3 weeks.\n\nHowever, my dentist hasn't proscribed anything more than Tylenol 3's, which were fine for the first two extraction the bottom, but after the 8 on the top were just pulled on Tuesday, the pain was so bad I ended up going to the ER for stronger medication, where they gave me 5mg percocet, which has helped greatly.\n\nI have one last series of extractions to be done tomorrow (Friday) and I know it's going to leave me in even more pain than the last. Is there anything I can say to convince my dental surgeon to give me something stronger than just Tylenol 3's?

    "title": "Dry Socket ~5 days after impacted wisdom teeth?",
    "dialogue": "Juni: I've been extremely paranoid about dry socket since my wisdom teeth removal on the morning of the 15th this month. I'd rather ask here first because I think I might be worrying too much.\n I had 4 impacted wisdom teeth and they used dissolvable stitches. I followed all care instructions very carefully, I don't smoke, I haven't used a straw, eaten crunchy food, used alchol mouthwashes, I'm not on birth control, I'm young (18), etc. so I know I'm not likely to develop it. Today one of the dissolvable stitches (bottom right) came out. When I look at the extraction site I don't see a blood clot, it's more open at the top than it was but it's still like an elongated crevasse, so I can't see far enough down to see bone. It hurts more than it did before but that could just be my paranoia.\nShould I be concerned? Do you think a deep base tissue layer may have already formed? deany4: How did you go with it? Dipsey: It's healing don't panic! There is no mistaking a dry socket the pain is 3000% else it's fine."

Since the Extraction I had not stopped thinking about the experience and have ended up with really bad anxiety about going the denist. When returning for my check up yesterday the denist informed me another tooth on the opposite side needs to come out also. This tooth is also in bad condition as it is cracked. He wanted to take it out there and then which I declined and have now made an appointment for in 2 weeks time however I am worrying myself sick about the whole thing.\nThe denist already didn't seem to happy that I declined today however I literally just went in to panic and couldn't face it. Just the idea of the needles in my mouth and all that painful pressure just terrifies me! (I think I've been over thinking a little too much!!!)\nCan anyone advise if there is a way in which I could possibly have the tooth taken out under general anaesthetic at the local hospital? If so - how do I go about this?\nI literally cannot bring myself to go to this appointment now I have worried myself so much about it. Dipsey: Give yourself a little time so you can face another visit. Tell the dentist your fears and they will make you pain free as possible.

    "dialogue": "Lobna: I've been having pain very much similar to a tooth abscess pain in my lower right end molar (root canaled,crowned), except there is no swelling in my face, or any white spots on my gums. I went to two separate dentists and they both insist that my root canal look perfect. The pain goes away after a few days of antibiotic then comes back stronger after I go off medication.\nOne of the dentists told me to go get a dental panoramic x-ray to see what's wrong and he found a cloudy mass in my jaw in place of my extracted wisdom tooth, and he says there's some residual bone from the extraction that had cause some infection and he'll have to give me a minor surgery to clean up the bone and infected tissues. The thing is I have had that tooth extracted over 2 years ago and it hadn't bothered me since, and I still have the tooth here so when I came home I took a look at it and it seems complete to me, right down to the very tip of the root, so I don't know which part of it is still supposedly lodged inside my jaw. Also the pain I've been experiencing radiates from right beneath my molar, not from behind it where the extracted wisdom tooth used to be, and the pain used to be only when biting down before it became permanent. Finally I have looked at this cloudy area for a long time and it just does not seem like a bone fragment to me, So i'm including a picture of my x-ray with the crowned root canaled molar from where I think the pain radiates, and the area behind it where the cloudy lump appears to be. Can someone please help me identify that lump and whether there truly is a problem with the root canal or not? Thank you for your time. calcium48: when did the pain start?

Have had MUCH dental work and seems like the more work that was done, the worse the teeth got..  had 6 crowns on the top and I was allergic to the material they were made from and they had to be removed and I ended up with denture on the top..   Had a partial on the bottom and eventually, the teeth I had left on the bottom had to come out and a full denture made.   I had the extractions done (4 teeth... 2 on each side of the mouth)...  To fit the denture in, the dentist had to do quite a bit of clipping of the bone on the left side.. much pain after...  the pain am having now is mostly do to the back of the denture which will need to be adjusted... I have no bone in the back of the mouth after all the years of wearing a partial... so they had to build up the denture in the back to work...  \n  My concern is... the extraction site is showing the bone.. the gums do not appear to be healing over the bone.. the bone where the teeth came out of is exposed... She didn't put stitches in the gums to seal it... I've never had this issue with other extractions ... it concerns me that food particles (when I start eating more solid food could get down between the gums and the bone and cause infection..  right now am taking antibiotics..  All my dental procedures also had to have 2000mg of antibiotics before the procedure was done because of my knee replacement.. after the extraction, she told me to take the antibiotics every 6 hours til done... I am doing that.. but am concerned about the bone being exposed...  How do I make sure that the gums are going to grow over these bones on each side of the mouth??

    "title": "Failed implant experience, deciding next move",
    "dialogue": "KBB: This is going to be a long post and I thank anyone who has any advice and thoughts on my situation.  I really appreciate any help you can give me.\n\nBackground health information:\nAge: Early 30s\nNot a smoker, not diabetic, no known health problems.  I do not take any daily medication.\n\nOral Health: Really good.  I’ve never had a cavity in my life.  I brush 2-3 times a day.  I use mouthwash 3 times a day.  I get my teeth cleaned every 6 months on the dot.  I’ll admit that I am not the most consistent flosser in the world.  Prior to the events that I will speak of, the dental-related things I’ve had done are (A) all four wisdom teeth were removed with no problem and (B) I had invisalign braces.\n\nOkay, here we go.  In 2012 I was the victim of an assault that ultimately knocked out 3 of my upper front teeth (both maxillary central incisors and my left maxillary lateral incisor).  I had bone grafts to repair the damage done to my jaw and the 3 lost teeth.  Next was the decision on what to do for the missing teeth.\n\nMy dentist and periodontist agreed that I should have implants put in.  Implants would:\n·  Last the rest of my life\n·  They would look more natural\n·  The screws of the implants would hold my bone together, slowing the loss of bone from missing teeth.\n\nMy dentist and periodontist advised me NOT to get a conventional dental bridge/crown instead of implants because:\n·  I would have to shave down 4 of my healthy teeth in order to make abutments.  On my left side, my canine and nearest premolar.  On my right side, my right lateral incisor and canine.\n·  The lifespan of bridges are not long (5 years on average?).\n\nI decided to go for implants because I wanted something that was going to last for the rest of my life, given my age.  I also really didn’t want to ruin 4 of my healthy teeth for the bridge, and potentially have problems later in life as those 4 teeth develop problems of their own.\n\nI underwent the implant process.  I had one post placed where the left lateral incisor had been.  The other post was placed where my right central incisor had been.  I also had to go through a gum graft, because my gums had receded quite a bit from all the surgeries.  During the healing time, I wore my invisalign brace, which had 3 fake teeth placed into it to hide the gap.  The periodontist wanted me to wear that instead of a regular denture because the invisalign wouldn’t put any pressure on the healing gum or bone.\n\nDuring this entire process, I never had any problems.\n\nOnce the posts were done, I was given a temporary implant-supported bridge (one bridge for all 3 missing teeth).  I wore that for 8 months.  I had no problems and it felt like my real teeth.  Then I was given the permanent bridge.\n\nThat is when the problems started.  First, the dentist couldn’t remove the temporary bridge.  That was an ordeal.  Then the permanent bridge didn’t fit well and the dentist had to work on it.  During the 10 months that I wore the permanent bridge, it fell out twice.\n\nAfter 10 months, I had visible abscesses forming on my gum in the areas around the posts.  The periodontists tried to treat the abscesses without surgery.  They took several x-rays and the bone looked fine around the implant. \n\nEventually, it became evident that surgery was necessary to detoxify the area.  During the surgery, they found out that I had bone loss around both implants.  The periodontist believed that the permanent bridge had put stress on my bone and over the 10 months, caused the bone loss.  I had some bone loss around the left lateral incisor.  I had a lot of bone loss around the right cental incisor.  Basically, the bone loss was on the front of the implants.  I still had bone up to the top thread on the back side of the implants, but bone loss on the front side.  This is why they didn't see the bone loss on the x-ray, since that is a 2 dimensional image.  Both implants were still integrated with the bone that was there and the implants were not mobile.  The periodontist tried to graft bone to the implants, but he informed me that it was not likely to take.\n\nIt’s been 4 months since that surgery and the left lateral incisor seems okay, but the right central incisor doesn’t look great.  The bone graft didn’t take and my gum has pulled away from the top of the post.  I can see several of the post threads now when I look at my mouth.  I had a CT-scan of my jaw and it confirmed that I didn’t get much bone growth from the graft.  On the plus side, I have not had any infections or abscesses since the surgery.  There was no sign of an infection on the CT-scan.\n\nMy current problem is what do I do going forward?\n\nThe periodontist suggested that we bury the implants/put them to sleep.  Basically, we give up on implants and I get the conventional dental bridge. \n\nThe periodontist said that there is not enough bone on the implants currently to do an implant-supported bridge.  If I want implants, I would have to have the current implants removed and start all over.  However, part of the problem is that my implants are integrated into the bone (what is left there).  He’s afraid that removing the implants would cause more damage to the bone, requiring multiple rounds of bone grafting and gum grafting.  He’s not sure how much bone he’d get back if he did a bone graft.  He mentioned that he could try INFUSE Bone Graft material, but that would be expensive and I would have to deal with a lot of facial swelling after the surgery.\n\nI’m honestly just stuck and not sure what to do.  My doctors keep saying that they have never encountered a case like mine before.  I had originally chosen implants because I didn’t want to lose 4 more healthy teeth to make a conventional dental bridge.  I wanted something that would last my life and wouldn’t have to be replaced every 5-10 years.\n\nI’m looking for any advice that people may have. \n·  Has anyone ever been through a similar situation?  Has anyone ever treated someone with a similar situation?\n·  Has anyone had an implant that was NOT mobile removed?\n·  Has anyone used the INFUSE Bone Graft material before?  What is the swelling like?\n·  Does anyone have a conventional dental bridge on their upper front teeth?  If so, what has your experience been with it?  How long have they lasted?  I don’t know anyone that has a bridge, or at least, no one has ever told me that they have one.  What does it mean when a bridge fails?  What does getting a bridge involve besides shaving the abutment teeth?\n\nI really appreciate any help/advice that I can get.  Thank you. Zuri Barniv: This is quite a story and I'm sorry to hear about your troubles. It's unlikely anyone on any forum could give you meaningful advice as your case is complicated and there are many details that can only be provided in-person. The few things I can tell you is that implants do not last a lifetime (necessarily). We hope they will, but no responsible dentist should ever tell you they will as a fact. As far as implants \"taking\" or integrating into the bone, there are so many reasons for bone loss around an implant. Usually, the problem is excess cement (glue) that seeps under the gums during the time the permanent bridge is placed. Overloading the implants is another cause. Another reason is if the implants were not placed in the most optimal location inside the bone. If the implants were not \"guided\" by a computer-made device, the risk of this goes up a lot. As you can see, there are plenty of things that could have gone wrong and there are certainly more reasons than I listed.\n\nAs I say on this forum many times, if you have a complicated case and the situation seems to be getting worse....stop, and get a second opinion. Seek out a \"prosthodontist\" (a special kind of general dentist) or even another regular dentist who has EXTENSIVE experience with implants for their thoughts. Whatever it costs, $100-200...it's worth it. And keep in mind that every dentist will tell you they are experts in implants because they took a course or two. They are not. You need to find someone who is truly seasoned when it comes to implants and that takes some effort as well, but it will be well-worth your time. I hope that helps,\nDr. Barniv Mary hart: I have had implants 4 years. I had a sinus lift and bone grafts. A couple months ago I got a salty taste in my mouth and it is constant. It comes from one of the implants. I went to a different periodontist because I never cared for my first one and wish my dentist hadn't sent me to him. The second periodontist found that the first had gotten the implant into my sinus. Right now I am scheduled for a surgery to look at and clean around the implant. I'm not sure what after that. Any suggestions or thoughts would be appreciated. \nI don't think the first periodontist would have ever told me he got the implant into my sinus."

The doctor has recommended my wife, who is 55 yrs of age, diabetic and hypertensive, have all six remaining teeth and her upper left molar extracted, for a total of 7, and then have 4 mini implants placed immediately.  My question is whether this is a wise course to pursue or should she wait for some healing before the implants are placed?  I have read several forums concerning this course of action, but they all seem to talk about a single replacement.  Digital x-rays are attached.  Any and all advice would be welcome."

    "dialogue": "Amyps: Hi All,\n\nI was wondering if anyone could help me.\nI have had a lower wisdom tooth and incisor removed Friday just gone. The lower incisor had previously had on and off infections. I think this is due to The top of that tooth being snapped off around 6 years ago when a dentist was attempting to remove it.\n\nThe second day after removal of the teeth I was surprisingly feeling a lot better. I did have pain but it was manageable with paracetamol and ibrufen. That night I woke up in tears with excruciating pain. Both holes had no visible blood clot and had vile yellow puss looking stuff in and around the holes. \n\nI went to an emergency dentist the next evening (day 3 after extraction) and was told I had dry socket. The dentist cleaned the holes and packed them with a brown looking substance that was dissolvable and antiseptic, it tasted a lot like Clive oil. The pain reduced dramatically straight away. I was told that the dressing would dissolve on its own and would not need changing but it keeps trying to come out and it smells so bad as if something has died in there! I mean I am not sure but this can't be good for the healing process. I removed a small part of it that was hanging over and as gross as it sounds it nearly made me sick it smelt that bad! \nI took the Monday off work just incase as I was still realy tired. Throughout the day I thought I was fine. Still in pain but again was manageable.\n\nOn Tuesday I decided to go to work so I got ready and felt fine, but on my way to work I started to feel realy dizzy, light headed, sick. my eyes were heavy as if they wanted to shut and I was really short of breath.\nI got to work and was sent home as I was sick when I arrived (this will partly be due to being on a bus they make me feel sick at the best of times) I could hardly focus on my computer screen.\n\nThis morning I feel exactly the same apart from I accidentally made my tooth bleed from brushing which will not be helping my situation, but other than that it is only the lower incisor that is hurting but I still feel the same - sick dizzy and have the shakes when trying to move around.\n\nI have tried to find anyone else in the same position or any information to read about it but I am still searching. I can find lots on a normal wisdom tooth or other tooth extraction but that's it, I am now on day 6 and have not yet returned to work and I think I'm going stir crazy! I also don't kkkw how much longer I can deal with the disgusting taste and smell that is in my own mouth\nI don't want to go back to the dentist as they said I will not get antibiotics unless there is bad swelling, and there is only slight swelling.\n\nI would love to have some sort of idea of what is happening, whether the dressing should be gone by now and when I should start feeling myself.\n\nI would be grateful if someone could help me! \nThank you"

    "dialogue": "saquiwej: Hello,\n\nI have had a bone graft surgery six months ago. It was an upper incisor number 9. The tooth in question had been dead for more than a decade before I finally decided to have it extracted. As, after it had died, apart from some periodical pulsations it did not cause pain, I neglected it for a long time. It was because of general health considerations that I at last made up my mind to have it taken out. By the way, it offered very little resistance to the dentist’s forceps. But, as one image stands for a thousand words, as the Chinese put it, I will try to upload the two X-rays showing the site before and after the extraction. There is an interval of about two years between the two, the time I hesitated as to the best course to take. My question is, whether bone grafting is possible at all at an extraction site where the surrounding bone is to such a degree decayed. The dentist told me that the outcome was not guaranteed, but all the same undertook the operation. I will have to return to him in two months, and I just want to have some independent expert opinion.\n\nAnother question in the same context: The dentist advised me not to wear any temporary place holding replacement because the pressure might cause the graft to fail. I wonder whether the two adjacent teeth will not gradually close the gap, especially if the graft fails. Even if it takes, is the bone formation itself at the graft site sufficient to prevent the two teeth from moving closer?"

    "dialogue": "Tracey: Hello, this has been a really fast and overwhelming situation for me. In the past year my teeth has really went down hill. I knew going into my appointment and being in a lot of pain that I had a few that's in really bad shape and most likely I needed to have those pulled. While at my appointment it was worse than I thought and not only did I have a lot of broken off teeth but they are rotted on the inside to the roots. So it was brought to my attention that even if I just got the four on the outside pulled that pretty soon the other ones would brake off and would have to pull those and so on and it would keep re-occurring over and over . So while I was there I had a total of twelve pulled, which left me with six teeth on the top front teeth and six of the bottom front teeth. The dentist had also talked to me about getting dentures while I was there here are my choice's :::\n\n       1. I could have a root canal on each of the teeth on the outer side that's left. 2 of the 6 that's left on the top and 2 of the 6 on the bottom. Then I could get a partial for both top and bottom. But he did want to let me know that it's a possibility that I could have some aggravation with it slipping out and trouble eating with the top partial. That I wouldn't have if I got a full set of dentures for the top.\n\n     2. I could get the other six teeth that I have left removed and get a full set of top dentures. He did let me that most people don't have unnecessary problem's like I would with a partial. I could also get my bottom six teeth pulled and get a full set of bottom dentures, but he don't recommend that because people has problems with those on the bottom because you don't have the roof of ur mouth on the bottom to have that suction too and they tend to move around and all that stuff. For me to get a partial on the bottom, due to me having six teeth on my front bottom teeth to hook to so they don't move around. I would still have to do a root canal on the two teeth that's on the outside of my bottom teeth.\n\nPlease look at my options and give me your feedback on what you think my best option is.

    "title": "Should I really extract my wisdom teeth?",
    "dialogue": "EveningWalk: Hello!,\n\nI hope you are doing well! I am scared and ambivalent about wisdom teeth removal and I apologize for this essay-length posting. However, I would really appreciate any comments or suggestions to this post. Please let me know if you are a dentist/dental student, etc.\n\nMy main questions (once you have read the information below it):\n\nIs the red circled region's pain a cause of impacted wisdom teeth?\nAre what the oral surgeon and dentist saying true?\nShould I extract all my wisdom teeth?\nShould I remove the wisdom teeth all in one sitting?\nI am 25 years old, and am a male. My bottom 2 wisdom teeth are impacted like the x-ray shown below (it's not my x-ray); and upper 2 wisdom teeth are going in the opposite direction also similar to the x-ray (yellow circled teeth--not sure if those are wisdom teeth though).\n\nMy current situation:\n\nI have sensitivity to eating and drinking sweet things, at about two teeth away from each side of the lower wisdom teeth (see red circled region in x-ray).\nI cannot handle chewing food that requires tension, such as eating medium-hard/hard bread such as baguettes, crunchy food like granola bars and nuts. These things also cause toothaches in the same region. I remember about 2 months ago, i ate semi-hard bread and had pain there for a week :/ At that instance, i assumed this was due to impacted wisdom teeth and I decided to remove them.\nI have had discomfort of opening my jaw all the way since I was like 11 years old. The tension is what causes discomfort at the sides. \n          So I went to a dentist and he believes my theory of the red circled region's pain as a result of the impacted wisdom     teeth to be true. He referred me to an oral surgeon and yesterday I had my x-ray taken again.\n\n          The surgeon said he will have to put me in IV sedation (not sure if this is entirely relevant, but I tend to get dizzy easily and have frequent headaches) and will have to cut my gums and all to extract the lower two wisdom teeth and said I should remove the upper wisdom teeth too anyway since it will supposedly get in the way of closing my mouth or something. It was also mentioned that if I don't remove my lower impacted wisdom teeth, food may get trapped there and cause infection and will eventually start eating away the adjacent teeth. I got scared when I saw that there are risks of nerve damage and of my jaw breaking etc. while reading the consent form. Even if these are rare cases, it's still scary :/. The oral surgeon's assistant told me not to worry and that in her 20 years of working there, she never saw any serious case like that.\n\n         They offered me a 25 percent discount and are charging me ~ $1,700 which is still quite expensive, no?. Thank you so much for taking your time to read this! Please advise. calcium48: If i were you I would have the 2 lower wisdom teeth out at the same time, as they are no good for eating chewing anyway.\nLeave the top ones for now and see how it goes, but as they will hard to clean it make cause decay to the adjacent teeth.\nI'm not a fan of having them all out at the same time, but that may be cheaper. EveningWalk: calcium48 said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIf i were you I would have the 2 lower wisdom teeth out at the same time, as they are no good for eating chewing anyway.\nLeave the top ones for now and see how it goes, but as they will hard to clean it make cause decay to the adjacent teeth.\nI'm not a fan of having them all out at the same time, but that may be cheaper.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nThank you sooo much for your input! calcium48: The issue about the nerve will always be there (i guess) whether you have them removed now or later.\nNot an easy one to call.\nThere are risks either way. Katerina SG: Hi there, I am a dental student in my last year. I can not see the x-ray, but it doesnt matter. In the university clinic, where I work we dont take the lower wisdom teeth at the same time. We do side by side, because you get an anestesia and a main nerve in the lower jaw is 'switched off (left or right)'. It means that you can not control half of your tongue . If you do it on the both sides, you can not control your tongue and you could kind of swallow it, which is pretty dangerous. we recommend to take out the wisdom teeth side by side, but upper and lower together. When you dont have the lower one , the upper one dosent have any function. \n\nThe issue about the nerve is not that bad, because it is only responsible for sensation on the skin on the part under your lips. Most of the time is reversible, but takes up to 3 months. Katerina SG: And you better have one side to chew on till the other side recovers Parthadental: After having read your complaint and going through the radiographic images you have provided :\n1. The red circled area could be an overlap or an artefact or prximal caries which has to be verified clinically.\n2. About removal of your wisdom teeth- Yes you should get them extracted immediately as it can definitely cause a cavity in the adjacent tooth causing damage to it. It can even cause difficulty in opening and closing of the jaw or even a cyst formation in some cases.\n3. Yes you should get all your wisdom teeth extracted. Your upper wisdom teeth do not serve any purpose and could cause cheek bites hence it is in your best interest that you should get them extracted.\n4. Ideally it is advisable to remove all your wisdom teeth in one single appointment because you may not have to take double dose of antibiotics and painkillers. Plus according to the radiographs provided it does not seem to be that complicated and if handled by a good maxillofacial surgeon then can be done without much difficulty. After the extraction you may have swelling in the extracted tooth region for around 3-4 days and difficulty in opening of the mouth. In a weeks span you will be back to perfect normalcy. Also it is advisable mto avoid smoking and alcohol after extractions and to have only soft diet.\n\nWe wish you the best of health.\nRegards\nPartha Dental Zuri Barniv: Ummm....did any of you notice that the two images are exactly the same, just mirror images of themselves?"

I will be having this done at NHS dental clinic and not my dentist.\nI have requested sedation (which I wouldn't have done if it was just the tooth I was removed) will be having my appointment to be assessed early next month. I will admit, although I am normally quite brave, this is putting the wind up me a bit. I will have a temp. false tooth, then a new one in 6 months when the bone has healed. Has anyone else had this problem on here ?"

    "dialogue": "Aravind243: Hi,\n\nI really need some help and guidance as I am quite suffering from pain for past 3 weeks and not sure until when this would continue. Here is my story:\n\nI was having sensitivity issues in my lower teeth and the dentist suggested to remove my lower wisdom tooth. It was really tough for them as they said they have applied too much pressure to remove it. But then, dentist suggested no stitches needed as any infection should go out. \n\nI did not get any swelling, but there was numbness for the 1st day and then 2nd day onwards pain was there in the day time and I was having paracetamol in the night and got better sleep. 2 weeks went, but the day pain was still there, did not go. Went to the doctor again and checked for dry socket issue. Dentist mentioned, it was all good and there is no dry socket and asked me to rinse with warm water..\n\nBut, the pain was still there and then it started in the night as well and pain killer did not help. I was not able to sleep at all. \n\nWent to dentist again for third time 2 days back, this time a senior dentist came and mentioned, my tooth is not clean and this has created bacteria and that is the main reason for the pain (Am not sure).....they suggested cleaning the entire tooth which took 1 hour. It was horrible time for me. \n\nNow, it is paining all day, and did not change at all. Pain killer is not helping me either.My question is:\n\n1. Is this starting from day 1 due to cleaning issue? \n2. Or is my healing takes more time as I am reading several websites that it might even take 3 months?\n3. Or is there any infection should I consult another dentist?\n\nOne main thing, is If there is very high pain, If I am drinking normal water, it goes away for a min, but the pain comes back....So, with this for past 2 weeks, am drinking close to 8-10 bottles every day..\n\nCan someone provide suggestion please!!!"

    "dialogue": "cadams0315: I had a very difficult extraction of #3 done two weeks ago yesterday. The canals and bone was crumbling as soon as my Oral Surgeon began the surgery.  He literally had tiny bone fragments and particles of broken teeth to get out plus the tooth itself, along with suctioning out a massive infection. A 45 minutes procedure took 3 hours.\n\n Any who, I had a recheck 7 days later. All was well. Except for some sensitivity to the adjacent teeth which my Oral Surgeon said was normal. I was told this would get better each day. He was right because by the 10 day, I will pain free. Three days of no pain. I was loving life.\n\nI then called a Periodontist because I wanted to see if I could talk to him about my receding gums.  There was a cancelation yesterday. Which is day 14 since the extraction.  The Periodontist examined my gums.  Poking and prodding which didn't hurt at the time.  Then he talk to me about what was going on. Much to my surprise it wasn't bad news.  By the time he was done showing me a short 3 minute video, I began to feel pain around the extraction site, the adjacent teeth and the gums. Plus my cheek was beginning to feel sore. Today, exactly 24 hours after going to the Periodontist, I am still feeling pain.  Why am I am feeling this pain? Is there something that has gone wrong with the extraction that I should be concerned with at this point?"

    "dialogue": "music-fps: [I don't know if this is the best subforum for this posting but I figure that some kind of surgery might be or will be in order for me.]\n\nEarly last month I, a guy in his late 60s, noticed that my LEFT cheek is now sunken. In that same time when I noticed this, my facial skin, in the area of the LEFT cheek sinking, looked quite ruddy to me as if it had changed for some reason-- my face usually isn't ruddy in color. The sunken LEFT cheek remains that way today. I looked up on the Internet what could cause this. I found some medical reason explaining why just 1 cheek would sink. And then I finally found the matter of a tooth extraction causing this cheek sinking due to bone loss. At first I thought that tooth #15 (an upper LEFT one) was pulled out a few years ago but today the clinic told me that that tooth was extracted in 2011.\n\nI'm wondering of course if this sinking will continue and what can be done about it. Can a super costly implant fill in the space of lost #15 and will that implant cause the LEFT cheek to appear normal? Since the extraction occurred 6 yrs. ago, is it too late for an implant to be installed if that might or will help?\n\nI also recall reading some online self-help for this. In that self-help recommendation, one is told to do an exercise by filling the mouth with air to puff out the cheeks. Then there was something about causing a strong smile while fully wrinkling the nose. I don't know what this is supposed to do but I thought maybe it improves some facial muscles to bring about cheek fullness. Is this just baloney?\n\n[Later this month I meet with my current dentist who's not the one who pulled out #15. He works though in the same clinic where my past dentist who did the extraction worked 'til ~ 1.5 yrs. ago.]\n\nCan any of you tell me more about this cosmetic problem and what can be done about it? Is a bone graft done for this? music-fps: I didn't think about the following 'til some time after posting my LEFT cheek sinking problem here.\n\nThis past Jan. into early Feb. I had a strange, extremely painful canker sore in the upper left gum by the extracted tooth #15 which was pulled out 6 yrs. ago. The canker sore physical pain was so bad I couldn't sleep and my daytimes were miserable for some weeks. I consulted my dentist twice in Jan. and once at the start of Feb. Since this LEFT sinking seems to have happened rather quickly and since it must have been occurring when I had the odd canker sore, I wonder if some strange infection or virus could have caused the canker sore and the cheek sinking.\n\nHave any of you ever heard of a link or causation of canker sore to cheek sinking in the area where a tooth had been extracted some years ago?"

Dr. John Jay: Sorry to hear about your terrible experience. If you have denti-cal (you mentioned medi-cal which is covers your medical not dental needs in California) then chances are that you'll end up with an inexperienced younger dentist. However it's great that there was an oral surgeon around to jump in and save the day. Your concerns about nerve damage are legit. Nerve damage can occur if your dentist is not careful during tooth removal surgery. I hate to tell you this, but removing difficult broken teeth does involve some shoveling as you call it. The more broken down your teeth are, the harder removing them becomes. Also infected and broken teeth are more difficult to numb up and may require additional shots. Either way, it's good that you found an oral surgeon who knows what he or she is doing. My advice to you is to go directly to the oral surgeon next time you need a tooth removed. Removing broken down teeth is difficult for general dentists, particularly the younger ones. It's probably worth spending a little out of pocket, I'm guessing the oral surgeon probably charged you for bone graft placement, then to risk permanent nerve damage or other serious complications. And don't even think about not removing your other broken tooth piece! Rotten root pieces can cause many medical and dental issues if neglected and left in your mouth. Hope this helped and best of luck to you.\n\nDr. John Jay\nDentist and occasional blogger at dentaldecider.com"

I went back to the dentist on the 4th day and was told I had \"dry socket\" and the healing is now abnormal and prolonged. They packed my socket with that clove material/fibre. This did relieve some of the pain temporarily but tasted absolutely disgusting and fell out after 2 days. I then went back again on day 6 to have the socket packed again. This again provided temporary relief but has fallen out again. \nIt's now day 11 and I am still in excruciating pain with a large open hole in my gum. It doesn't seem infected, no pus or fever. And when I was at the dentist a few days ago he told me it wasn't infected. I clean it everyday with warm salty water. I am solely relying on painkillers to get through the day, which is making my job difficult. And often I wake up from the pain in the early hours of the morning when the painkillers have warn off. I still cannot eat properly (limited solid foods) or drink water without triggering more pain. And I feel like the pain is not isolated to the area of the extraction but is actually up the side of my face and into my ear. \nI know that dry socket makes the healing slower but should I still be in so much pain? \nIt's almost unbearable!

    "dialogue": "jaygreg: Seeking opinions on a rather touchy situation....\nTwo implants (#18 and #19) are 22 years old. During the first six years, the crowns atop the implanted stems worked loose six times. Finally, in the sixth year, one implant stem actually snapped. All has been well until a month ago; both are coming loose again.\n\nDuring the first few months following the initial surgery, it was discovered that the dentist (not the surgeon) was unaware the crowns had torque specifications. He had no torque wrench and I was sent back and forth to the surgeon who torqued the crowns.\n\nRemedy hasn't materialized yet because the doctors, I assume, are in conference with one another. Cost probably isn't even being discussed. This may become an issue I'd like to avoid but I also want to be fair. I distinctly recall the surgeon telling me the \"servicing\" of those implants was NC for life. But those crowns... here's where things may get sticky.\n\nFrom my decades of experience with simple nuts and bolts, the more a nut is placed on and removed from its bolt the less of a grip it seems to have; easier to remove the next time. Because one of these implants had its screw tampered with at least half a dozen times (the other snapped, was replaced, and never loosened) - which wouldn't have happened if it were torqued properly in the first place - we may have a shared responsibility here. I'm inclined to lean in that direction. \n\nWhat say you... and what's a fair share on my part? jaygreg: I’ll probably be facing a decision on this Monday or Tuesday. Since one implant sustained six torques and the other broke on the sixth but has remained secure since (they got the torque routine down pat by then I guess), I’m inclined to think I should be fully responsible for the last implant but half responsible for the first. Does this seem fair?"

    "dialogue": "Catriona: Hello All!\nI'm posting this here for my mother. Here's the story, and hopefully we can get some answers.\n\nA few weeks ago we went to Mexico for some dental work. I had some cavities worked on, and my mother needed a few crowns and found out she needed an implant. She went back a week later and had the work done. \nShe started feeling immense pain shortly after. She was given an antibiotic and a pain killer - which relived her pain somewhat, but not by much. Several days later, the pain was unbearable and it looked really red and almost \"infected\" looking. She called the dentist and went back down for them to take a look. They said the implant may have been initially too big, and that it would probably be best at the moment to just take out the tooth (leaving the screw inside) and let it heal. She came home, and a week after she was still feeling pain. She contacted an oral surgeon in America and had him take a look. He said he didn't see anything particularly wrong with the way it was done, just that it may have trapped some bacteria down inside and there was a 50/50 chance that it could recover from more antibiotics. He sent her home. The next day she was in tears and set up an appointment with the same doctor to just have him remove everything from the implant site. They did so.\n\nShe is on day 4 of having it out, and she is still feeling incredible amounts of pain. She is still on pain medication and the antibiotic and she is sick of being on pills and feeling \"loopy\" all the time. I took a picture of the tooth site, and am wondering if anyone can give any insight as to what the cause of the pain may be??\n\nThank you! PlacidWay-US: Hi @Catriona May I ask how many implants does your mother have? If it's a single dental implant the pain will not last more than 2 to 3 days. If she had several implants and also had dental bone grafting the pain may last for weeks. In your mothers case probably it is infected, it can be an infection of the soft gum around the top of the implant, or a deeper infection in the bone surrounding the implant. So better again ask your dentist about this they should know what causes the pain and what needs to be done. Good luck! svor1988: They may have hit a nerve? My pain still comes back over 10 years later due to repeat infections and my body fighting it off.

But he has been very happy and didn't complain much at all about pain Plaza Dental Group: Dental Implant placement causes very little discomfort compared to other surgical procedures. If bone grafts or tissue grafts are performed along with the implants there may be slightly more discomfort, but still only minor. The pain is easily controlled with over the counter analgesics such as ibuprofen, but for the first day a narcotic may be needed."

I've been trying to grow them in for two years now but there is too much crowding and pain that radiates into my neck, jaw, and ears from them.\n\nI am a little concerned because I have a few other dental issues and I'm not sure if I should take care of those first. I have a couple shallow cavities that I have been putting off getting fillings for because the don't bother me much. Then I have a tooth that broke a couple years back (#15 second molar). It was filled (a huge filling!) 4 years ago. I am overdue on getting a crown for it because I haven't had dental insurance to help pay for it. It hurts from time to time and I have bad breath that comes from that area so I'm worried that I have bacterial issues.\n\nSo basically if I have other dental issues will I be more likely to get an infection after my wisdom teeth are removed? Should I just try to bite the bullet and get the other work done first? It's just so pricy but I really don't want any complications from my wisdom teeth removal. \n\nThanks very much! svor1988: Keep shopping around is my advice. Bad breath may indicate a dead tooth or serious decay (e.g. under a crown). Keep those cavities clean in the meantime & avoid soda.\n\nYou may wish to consider extracting #15 and let the wisdom tooth push forward to close that gap. Would be cheaper than fixing #15 and extracting the good wisdom tooth..."

    "dialogue": "Alexander Sean: Hello,\nYou can all just call me Alex. Yesterday here in Ontario Canada at about 2:30-3pm my time I underwent an elective wisdom tooth extraction for a fully grown bottom wisdom tooth that had a cavity on it too big to repair. I have always neglected my oral hygiene but nothing to the extremes that you would see on Google images and the like. I just neglect my brushing. Anyhow, the extraction was quick and without incident, took about 15 minutes and 5 shots of numbing but I was fully awake without any anesthesia and the tooth was out in a few minutes. After getting home, I followed all my dentists instructions. No strenuous activity, no solid foods, no straw drinking and no smoking. (I don't smoke cigarettes anyway.) When I got home I waited for the bleeding to subside and then I ate some oatmeal, some vanilla ice cream and some soup before bed drinking water all the way. Today the pain has barely been present but I have been taking advil liqui-gels every 4 hours just to be sure. It is now 10:30pm the day after the extraction and I am just now getting a good look at the extraction site. I was given no stitches which was odd, but now I am seeing white/yellow streaking all around the gum socket. This can't be normal and looks like an infection but is it possible to be infected that fast? I can't afford another consultation let alone another procedure and yes...I am already on government assistance and have used up all the dental funds with the extraction yesterday. Anyone who can verify if I am in danger of sepsis from leaving this alone for a month please reply. I have included a picture of the extraction site to the best clarity I could get. Please forgive the crudeness of the image and my rambling. Sincerely,\n\n-Alexander. Dentgr: Hello Alex!\nI don't think there's something to worry about.\nIt seems to me that this is a normal healing process.\nDon't worry about not having sutures.

To preface, all of my wisdom teeth came in straight since I had extra room due to removal of other teeth for orthodontia when I was a child.  No dentist has ever recommended removing them since they are healthy and cause no pain or other problems.\n\nRecently, part of one of these teeth broke off.  They tried to fill it, but it only lasted about a month.  The recommendation is to go ahead and have it removed.  The oral surgeon said the procedure won't last more than a half hour, from sitting in the chair to leaving.  Extra half hour if I choose to have IV anesthesia due to recovery time.\n\nI would prefer not to do the IV, just have a local.  I'm looking for some description of what I will and won't feel during the process.  They talk about pressure, grinding sounds, etc, but not really pain.  I'm not an anxious patient; frankly more anxious about anesthesia side affects like lingering grogginess, deliriousness, and vomiting.

Dental implants were among the worst decisions in my life. I didn't know the molars would just push forward to close the gap naturally. Sorry to hear your complex and ultimately unnecessary experience.\n\nAs it is a front tooth this is more a cosmetic issue I guess. I'd just chew/bite on the other side. I've read about too many bridges going wrong and killing their supporting teeth to even consider that- bridges don't last forever anyway. Nikolai Fesenko: When choosing a bridge it is necessary to remember that tooth bridges have advantages and disadvantages. \n\nAmong advantages, there are high solidity, high color stability, relatively low price, fast production (5-10 days). \n\nAs for disadvantages, they are the bridge construction transfers the chewing load on the roots of teeth, which are under the crown of a tooth. That is such a construction overloads the supporting teeth.\n\nFor producing the bridge construction it is necessary to make preparations and sometimes to fill canals. This weakens the teeth solidity noticeably.\n\nThe bridge construction makes crowned teeth work simultaneously, while naturally it is required the independent mobility of each tooth.\n\nThese three above mentioned factors lead to teeth destruction. The process of destruction is very slow and drag on years. But the more pronounced tooth decay before the prosthetics, the less the bridge construction will serve.\n\nThe larger the length of the bridge construction, the worse will be the prognosis."

Gradually more and more fell off and eventually (a few minutes ago) the filling fell out.\n\nWhat's underneath looks exactly the same color as diagrams of infected pulp, except that it doesn't hurt at all\n\n(The filling went down to about the gumline, and acording to the diagrams i looked at, dentin doesn't go that deep, so logically, what i'm seeing is pulp)\n\n\nWhat procedure will i likely have to get, and what kind of anesthetic will i be treated with? (Like, will only my mouth be numbed, or will i be put fully unconsious) svor1988: Certainly a local anesthetic.\n\nHope you get help from somebody else here.\n\nBut in case they don't, yes it is possible for pulp to be infected and you don't feel pain. They would use a tap test or a cold/hot test for diagnostics. Go see a dentist ASAP, with emergency booking if possible. Sounds to me like the original filling wasn't completely cured by the placing dental practitioner, thus it had insufficiently bonded to the tooth, allowing infection to set in underneath, leading to the failure you now see. Composites should last 8+ years.\n\nIn my experience, my main dentist always used their curing light for two cycles for each filling. They said they wanted to make sure it stayed. The next dentist I saw cured 3 adjacent composites for less than half a cycle in total. One fell out the next day, another a month later.\n\nLooking around online I see one issue where older curing tools won't cure newer composite formulations well. There are also differences between the effectiveness of these curing light device models.\n\nThe former dentist was cheaper, however he made a mistake. So I thought by paying a more expensive dentist, that wouldn't happen. Boy I was wrong. Plaza Dental Group: By viewing your snap I can say it’s a case of cavity but as a doctor I have to analyse you live in order to detect your oral problem.  A root canal is normally done when there is a problem, such as inflammation or infection, which can result in tooth decay, a cracked tooth or a continued need to treat the area. Undergoing a root canal helps prevent pain and the possibility of developing an abscess. Root canals on broken teeth are necessary if the fracture is extensive enough that the pulp is exposed.  Other indications for a root canal include deep decay and resorption.  If the dentist has confirmed through examination and pulp tests that the root system is vital and healthy, then a root canal is not necessary and should not be performed.  Once a root canal is done, the blood and nutrient supply of the tooth are depleted, causing the tooth to become brittle and weak.  As the saying goes, \"Don't fix something that isn't broken."

Just my luck. They say the feeling will return but im not so hopeful. 2 questions.\n1 The day after he had me come in for another CBCT scan to double check the implant that he did eventually install wasnt violiating the nerve canal. From the scan it is at 3mm above the canal. My question is, he insured that implant is ok where it is and by removing it will not alleviate the problem im having with numbness. He said if the implant was still causing problems i would be having pain. Is is ok to leave it in? Im getting mixed views on that.     2nd question- can the CBCT scan that i had the next day after the nerve was damaged hinder the repair of the nerve in any way because of the radiation?\nIm so sorry if i sound paraniod but the thought of being like this the rest of my life is really scary!\nThanks\nMike RightBoy91: 1 word\n\nCOMPENSATION !\n\nseriously . svor1988: Yes, radiation does slow cellular function. Cellular facilities exist for DNA repair and such due to radiation. Just don't do more than one CT scan in an area every 2 years.

You're at risk of biting through your own lip at night or while eating and not even knowing it. A lawyer in your jurisdiction would know more. Cases in my state pay hardly much for emotional damages.\n\nSearch for 'implant nerve damage case malpractice OR negligence' to see cases. I guess the legal term for this would be negligence. You can read through these cases to understand what happened.\n\nMake sure you contact your insurance company and state medical board about this.\n\nFrom my understanding a conical CT scan should be made before placement, to accurately size the implant.\n\nIn my case, the orthodontist had used xrays to size the screw, and after he'd drilled the hole his assistant came back from the storeroom saying they were out of the size he wanted. He said get the next biggest size, and he explained to me that it would hold better. It perforated my sinus cavity and I suffered immensely due to sharp never ending pain, bone loss, palate damage, permanent semi-dry mouth, and constant mucus draining into my mouth alongside the implant. Not to mention around $10k+ of restorative surgeries. I lost months worth of work over the years due to being bed ridden from resultant infection and sickness. It was a miracle they didn't fire me."

    "dialogue": "RST: Good morning,\n\nI am very concerned because I had three wisdom teeth extracted yesterday and I am afraid that the standards of care were not followed. One of them was impacted and required a surgical approach and they used bone graft on both lower sites following the extractions. I am afraid that the DDS who did the procedure did not take all the measures to prevent infections and I am very scared that this can cause me a lot of issues in the future. Right before the surgery I asked the team what they would use to clean my mouth. The assistant said that they would not use anything. Then, when the surgeon came in, I asked him the same question and he looked at me like I was crazy and said that they, in fact, would not use anything. I asked again, so you don't clean with iodine or anything at all? He said no. I frowned and was trying to make sense of his answer. Then I thought to myself: well, maybe it is because the mouth is so dirty that there is no point. While that was happening they were already starting the laughing gas and he pushed the midazolam in my IV. Next thing I know, I am going home and the procedure is done.\n\nThis morning, with a little more mental clarity, I started reading about the protocols for oral surgery and bone grafting and they all say that chlorhexidine is usually used as a rinse or iodine swabs can substitute but it is critical that asepsis be done prior to a procedure like the one I had, mostly because bone grafts were used.\n\nI am freaking out now and I am extremely mad for not advocating for myself; yesterday, I was scared to death as it was the first time that I had any sort of surgery and anesthesia and I did not even have enough time to think and challenge the DDS's answer. As a nurse, I have read a lot about clean VS sterile procedures but I have no experience whatsoever in oral surgery protocols. Also, I am very concerned because, despite all the contact isolation measures used in hospitals, I could have been exposed to MRSA the night before the procedure given that both of my patients were positive for it.\n\nSo, I have three questions for the forum:\n\n1) What is the current evidence-based practice accepted by the dentist community on this matter? Should the DDS have at least rinsed my mouth prior to the procedure?\n2) What can I do in order to prevent complications such as osteomyelitis. Should I ask him for a prescription for additional antibiotics that are known to be effective against MRSA. I am currently taking amoxicillin only.\n3) Unfortunately, I cannot go back and stop the procedure. When can I stop worrying about this? How long after the surgery an infection is still likely? Catriona: I had my wisdom teeth extracted and never had any kind of rinse or antiseptic. he was one of the best oral surgeons in California too. Just make sure you take the antibiotics. I had a friend that died from wisdom teeth extraction because he didn't take his antibiotic. RST: I am sorry about your friend. I did take all of my antibiotics and I am doing well. I will continue to watch the sites closely for any signs of infection. svor1988: They really rely on oral antibiotics don't they? Yes my dentist used iodine swaps prior to cutting in. And they sanitize all their tools.\n\nSaliva does a pretty good job of keeping your mouth clean. Sorry to hear about your friend. Wisdom tooth extraction is an unnecessary practice in my opinion. Read about that if you want. I wish insurance companies would require proof that each extraction is medically necessary.\n\nIf his were medically unnecessary. I am curious if your friend's next of kin (or dependents?) could have pursued a wrongful death suit."

The oral surgeon repaired the sinus communication, but now I can feel some suction along one side of my gums.  It's almost like the flap that was covering the extraction has come loose on one side.  I don't think there is an opening to the sinus because I haven't felt air going in or out, and I haven't had any fluid go up my nose.  \nIs it possible that the sinus communication is closed, but now there is a space between the flap and the gums? svor1988: Non-dentist here. I'd say yes. For me the surgeon had to do that surgery 3 times. Each time it wore out and the hole opened again. Beyond 3 times he said he'd have to take tissue from elsewhere in the mouth rather than just sliding it down.\n\nYour bone should heal closed given there isn't infection up in there. Mine wouldn't close forever because an adjacent molar (which had had a root canal) was still infected on at least one root, and prevented the sinus perforation from healing. After pulling the molar, the perforation healed. Hope that helps somebody."

It has been a week and a day since the oral survery and six days since the tongue incident. Both still hurt, mostly the tongue. I have stayed on the soft food diet and am still taking 3 to 4 ibuprofen every four hours for the pain. The tongue never bleed from this that I know of. I am 54. What should I do? everway9: Hello. If your pain has not gone away to the extent that you still require pain killers I would advise you to contact the dentist and ask them for advice. Depending on how much trauma was caused during the extraction it can take over a week to heal and the swelling to go down. Also as you know tortilla chips can have some pretty sharp pointy edges. It may be wise to ask your dentist to check that there are no foreign objects lodged in the socket. Can you feel anything in there?\n\nMost importantly.. what strength Ibuprofen are you taking? The maximum dosage of for an adult is no more than 400mg in six hours. It's concerning to hear that you are taking 3-4 tablets every 4 hours.

The extraction was complicated as the tooth itself was 'hard', as in like a diamond, and difficult (partially erupted, impacted, near the nerve nerve and a big tooth). The bottom was cut out in pieces which took about 45-50 minutes. I should add that my jaw was dislocated in the process (about 15 minutes into the first tooth). It was reset on about the 12th attempt after the upper was removed . Two days later I noticed a brown discharge and what I would consider unusual swelling (from almost my temple to down the front of my neck in a v-shape, down to my collarbones.

I was then admitted to A&E for IV antibiotics. In the past day I have noticed a significant reduction in the swelling, which is great but I am concerned about two things. First, recovery time. This seems like a particularly complicated extraction with a number of complications likely to result in longer recover times. Can anyone give me a guide on when I might feel normal again (basically if I miss a pain killer window now the hammering in my jaw starts again)?

    "dialogue": "stuart31: I recently had a diagnosis of a cyst above a back tooth in the maxilliary area. There had been some swelling there for some time that my dentist failed to diagnose, although this swelling was painless after an initial bout of a couple of days pain. \n\nSix months ago I started to use a salt water rinse and overnight the swelling 'burst' taking with it some bone and soft tissue. The soft tissue seemed to regenerate very quickly though and now the area feels normal apart from a foul tasting discharge every now and then.\n\nThe cyst was seen on a CT scan and I am due to have this removed. My concern though is that the cyst is cancerous, as my consultant said that it may or may not be, which has made me very worried. I have no other 'red flag' but wondered what the odds were?\n\nAlso on a side note, would this area ever be suitable for a dental implant or should I consider a denture?\n\nThanks for any help you can offer!\" clb_: Was the cyst hard or squishy?

Asking out of concern for myself to as my maxillary area is inflamed and hard and hurts a lot.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n\nThe cyst was 'squishy', and painless for the most part after some initial pain which subsided after a couple of days.\nI had an operation to remove the cyst about a month ago, also some surrounding bone was taken and two teeth (at the back so not noticeable except by me). Turns out it was benign, although there are many types of cyst and I don't know yet which this was. I had a GA and the worst part of that are the after effects of the operation....bad throat infection and now a GI infection from the antibiotics!!! The Cyst removal has healed quite well! \nI wouldn't worry too much, if it is a cyst I now gather they are usually (if not all the time, frankly) benign lesions, and if caught early can by removed under local anaesthetic. I had mine for years, but no-one noticed until I had a CT."

Dr David Lee: Hi joaquin,\n\nSorry to hear about your little brother. \n\nI assume that you are talking about baby teeth molars since you said the dentist said he'll be needing them until 12. If the baby root canal (pulpotomy) is not providing relief for the pain, then extraction of the baby tooth is advised. In terms of the consequences of extraction, it is best to maintain the space for the adult teeth by using a space maintainer. If you have any x-rays, it would help in providing you with more information.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to ask for more advice!"

My question is....is it normal practice to be charged for an adjustment on each implant before any work even begins? Zuri Barniv: Once the implant is placed, it will not move, shift or anything like that. I have no idea what it means \"adjust the implant\". What I do see is that you are getting \"custom abutments\" and that is what you may be referring to?? That is not an adjustment to the implant. That is what goes above the implant. It is a bit unusual that all the implants need this \"custom abutment\" as in most cases, a \"stock abutment\" is perfectly fine and it costs a lot less."

Secondly, the people who did my extraction told me no solid foods for today, but tomorrow morning, i'll be good to go on everything. However, according to a few websites, I am supposed to wait 48 to 96 hours before fully being able to eat solid food. Why is this? And lastly, after making some oatmeal (One of the only enjoyable foods I can think of that my dentist said was fine and isn't bad for me like pudding and icecream) I noticed that the oats seemed like something I shouldn't be allowed to eat. Couldn't they get stuck in the little holes? So I poked around online, and sure enough, the first website I came across said I should wait until the 3rd day of healing, as they make get lodged in the wisdom teeth sockets.

I did not get my first cavity until age 30, and it is so small, my new dentist can not even see it on the x Ray or tell where it is. I also have a \"watch\" on another molar.\n\nOver the years, I have been to 3 or 4 dentists and none of them have said anything about needing to remove my wisdom teeth, but my new dentist is recommending that I have them removed. He says since they are harder to clean, they can cause problems as I get older and he basically believes that ALL people should have wisdom teeth removed, regardless of whether they are causing problems. He thinks I should have them out now, because the older I get, the worse the surgery recovery will be.\n\nI'm wondering what other professionals think. Should I have them removed now (even though I'm not having any problems) just in case I encounter problems as I age? What could happen if I  DONT remove them?  I'm wondering if anyone over 30 has had fully erupted wisdom teeth removed? Will the surgery be worse since the roots are fully formed?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice/thoughts/opinions/personal experiences! PlacidWay-US: Hmm... I don't think there is a need for extraction as you said it does'nt bother you and you're able to keep it clean. If the wisdom tooth is not causing any pain whatsoever, and is not causing any discomfort such as causing you to bite your cheek, then there is no need for extraction. Maybe it is your dentists personal decission or maybe he has reason so don't b afraid to ask him."

Anyone else have this situation and how did you cope with it?\nMike Zuri Barniv: What country do you live in? yellowcouch: United States Zuri Barniv: Was it a general dentist or an oral surgeon that did the work? Do you have ANY sensation in your lip and chin or is it totally numb? What has the dentist done so far? The first thing that should be done is the implant should be removed or pulled out part-way after you have a cone beam (3D) x-ray. Has any of this been done? The answers will help me help you.\nDr. Barniv yellowcouch: The implant was placed by my periodontist 2 weeks ago. During the procedure the implant drill went to far down into the nerve canal and nicked or bruised the LAN nerve. I felt what was like an electrical shock. He backed the drill up and then proceeded to place the implant. Later that night i informed him that my lower right chin lip and gum were still numb. They are not completely numb but have an altered sensation like pins and needles. The hardest thing to deal with has been the feeling of tightness in my lower 4 teeth on that right side. They feel as if i have toothpicks stuck between them. Very hard to deal with! The following day he did a Cone Beam CT scan to make sure the implant wasnt violating the nerve canal. It wasnt. It is about 2mm away from the nerve canal. He feels that the implant can be left where it is and i will regain feeling within 1 or 2 months.  I then got a second opinion from another dentist who without seeing the imaging recommended to remove the implant.   Now this is my dilemma. Whether to leave it in or take it out. My question is....If the implant is not impinging on the nerve canal what is the harm in leaving it it? Wouldnt taking it out possibly cause more trauma to an already damaged nerve? Plus i want to eventually have a tooth there. Could the implant in any way be contributing to the feeling of tightness on those 4 teeth or is that a result of the initial nerve damage? Will leaving it in hinder the nerve repair process? I know thats alot of questions, im just trying to make sense of all this so i can make an informed decision whether to have it removed or not. . Ive attached a x ray taken just after the implant was placed to give you an idea of its position. The tooth to the left was extracted right after the implant was placed. Thanks in advance for any help you can give me. Zuri Barniv: This is a very unfortunate outcome to say the least. There are reasons to remove the implant but of course there will be various opinions on the matter. I am experienced but not an expert on the subject. You may or may not recover sensation to the nerve and there is a chance for other complications. Where in the USA are you? There are universities that specialize in these types of issues and they would be a great help. Beyond that, it is difficult for me to give you much more over the internet, unfortunately. yellowcouch: Thanks for your reply. If you know of anyone that deals in this matter please let me know. I am located in Pennslyvania. Thanks Mike Zuri Barniv: Penn I do not know. But you might see if there are any teaching universities for dentistry nearby and ask them if they have a department that deals with \"iatrogenic Inferior Alveolar nerve injuries\". If they don't, ask who they recommend you see that specializes in these problems."

I will give a short story explaining what has happened and see if someone ( there seems to not be many available here)  can understand what went wrong.\n\n2002. -  dentist performed #15 root canal.  Seemed to go as expected but approximately about 9 weeks later developed knot high in gum above #15.  This was painful and several rounds of antibiotics ( last 2 together were very strong). would not make the hard knot go down.  Finally got Apico from Surgeon which went well for a few months then swelling around area where extraction and knot on gum was swelled again.  I had terrible headaches and believe me or not very painful joints and stiffness in hands, legs and feet.  He did a cone beam scan and went back in to scrape the bone..  Said there was soft mushy bone in there and got all of it out.  Continued to have tender spot there and intermittent month on \\ off swelling for 3  -  5 days a month.  I normally got sick those days and didn't want to get out of bed.\n\n2006 -2007.  -  The spot at #15 still causing problems on and off with surgeon and dentist not seeing anything worth opening me back up.  At least that's what they said. #16 gets a knot and I go back to my surgeon and he really says he can't see anything on cone beam again.  He sends me to endo and he takes film before procedure and says I really don't see that you need root canal on the tooth.  He said one spot seemed questionable and I passed all hot\\ cold test.  He decided to go ahead after talking to surgeon.   About the same time later on #16 did the same thing as #15  and surgeon said  apico or pull it.  I wanted it pulled to just get all this over..  It is today and I am in terrible pain at #15 & #16 being the main flare up.  #15 is inset where he had to grind it and that area sometimes gets tender with pain.  #16 has a knot that is bigger than a tooth would be if it was one in there. This happens several times a month which is increasing along with headaches.  I explained to my neurologist that as this swelling in #16 gets to the max my body seems like I am getting the flue..  Everything seems stiff and painful.  \n\nThat's the quick version and all my docs see this and seem not to know how to treat me.  Surgeon just done another cone beam and said he didn't see anything alarming but verified the large swollen knot and pain.  He pointed out it could be small bone infection \\ micro debris in there butt he could just not go opening me up.  What should I do?  Neuro said it is not nerve related and is puzzled.  Please see one attached photo and this is not the biggest it has gotten at all.  Probably along the lines of in the middle.\n                   Thanks.  Charles CharlesH: Anyone??????"

Two of them were impacted. Everything seemed to go well and the swelling went completely down. About a month after the removal, I felt a lump on the bottom left side of my jaw. I called my surgeon to ask if this was a problem, and they told me I was fine. Two months later (three months after surgery), the lump was still there and it felt like it was getting bigger. My face was slightly swollen and tender to touch. I called my surgeon again and they prescribed me with Pinicillin to help the swelling. They were going to have me come in for an appointment, but I was unable to because I'm at school which is four hours away from home. About two weeks ago I felt something sharp coming out the hole. I was able to get it out and it was a bone/tooth looking sharp fragment. I called again and they said I would be okay. Yesterday, I woke up and my face was much more swollen and I was in a lot of pain. I called and they finally referred me to someone to get it looked at. I just got back from that surgeon, and I had an abscess caused by many bone fragments left in the hole. They just numbed me, cut the hole back open, and got out a pretty good amount of bone.\n\nI'm really just wondering if this was my original surgeons fault, or if it is something that just happens. My original surgeon refused to pay for it since I wasn't able to drive four hours back home. What caused so many bone fragments to get stuck?"

I would have zero issues with a root canal - I have had a few of them and even had one on this tooth before - but the price would be the issue. $35 to get a tooth pulled is easier to cover right now rather than the $700+ for the surgery. But I am just anxious and depressed over losing the tooth for good. \n\nI have had bad teeth most of my life and it's always made me very self conscious. Twice in my life I have had major work done and in 2009-2011 I had a great dentist who did a massive restoration plan and they redid fillings all the time which was the first time in my life I was able to manage to have a nice smile.

It would be the end of my teenage years for when I moved, got a job and started being part of society again and just accepted the missing tooth. \n\nWhen I met my previously mentioned awesome dentist she said the space for the canine was too small for an implant unless I got braces first because my bite had changed so I put that on the back burner for the time. She had told me getting a new flipper made was also not going to work but then she told me to come in one day and said they would at least try because they knew I was going to see my family the next month for the first time in six years. Two days later I had a flipper and it was perfect. Happiness galore. \n\nI was told I can get my front tooth removed and they would make me a new flipper. I do have to be enrolled with their company (meeting is tomorrow) in order to get one made (which is also making me nervous). I'll hopefully have prices on it after that - which is what I was waiting on before getting it pulled - but in any event I will have at least a few days without a flip and even so the idea of losing the tooth just stresses me out. \n\nI always wear my flipper, no one in my life really knows I wear one. My husband knows I have one for a missing tooth but not even he has seen me without it in. \n\nI don't drive and my son is in preschool otherwise I would probably ask him to go see his parents while I had everything done but alas... hiding out in bed and avoiding talking or when I do putting  a hand over my mouth sounds like nothing I am looking forward to."

I hope your all doing good!\n\nUnfortunately I have never been good when it comes to dental hygiene and because of that I have had a lot of teeth extracted in my time. I think I have been lucky, that in the past the most painful part of the extraction procedures have normally been the 'Lidocaine/Epinephrine' injections prior to the extractions. However, today I experienced the most painful extraction I can remember. It was one of my upper front teeth... number 8 incisor to be precise. I had to keep stopping my dentist from continuing with the extraction and get more anesthesia 3 times as the pain was too much for me to bear! I have quite a high pain tolerance and have experienced the pain associated with 'Pancreatitis' and 'Gallstone removal' which is pretty painful, (a story for another time) and no, being a male I have never experienced childbirth, although I have been told by a few women who have experienced Pancreatitis that Pancreatitis is just as bad or even worse than childbirth ). Anyway I got to the point where no matter how much anesthesia I had, it just made no difference. We had to continue. I cannot describe in words the type and amount of pain I felt. Ok the extraction only lasted a minute or so but it was horrible.\n\nI'm a curious person and would like to hear from anyone else here who has had the misfortune of experiencing multiple extractions. If so, which of your teeth were the most painful to have pulled? And/or have your experiences been similar or completely different?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nAndrew \n\nP.S. Please vote for your most painful extractions. Thanks sonickdmd: This all depends upon the dentist you are going for. A dentist can make your treatment painful or pain free.

    "title": "Concern about lingering issues after extraction before implant",
    "dialogue": "McMike: Hello.\n\nI have a history of sinus issues that sometimes cause dental pain, mostly left side, upper and lower jaw.\n\nLast year June 2015 I stared having pain in #18 lower left molar that eventually led to a crown prep, based on diagnosis of tooth crack.  Things got worse, so diagnosis was changed to root crack and extracted in July 2015.  The extraction was somewhat difficult. \n\nI am also concerned that I react badly to deep bone injections for numbing.  Since I had a lot of lasting jaw pain after this process, (and after injections for replacing filling upper right, I had jaw pain and local tenderness that lasted a couple weeks). During the initial crown prep injections, evidence of infection/pus came up through on of the injection channels as its \"way out\", which relieved much of the original pain.\n\nAfter extraction, graft materials was packed for implant prep.  First couple days post-op seemed on track, but got worse and eventually became persistent infection/dry socket.  Things eventually calmed down after the dentist cleaned out socket and much antibiotics.  Amox and clindamycin.\n\nI hate taking antibiotics.  They wreck my insides.  I have taken to much in my life already.  A second opinion I got said to do augmentin and flagyl, but I resisted and my main doc prescribed the clindamycin.  (I just took another round for strep last month).\n\nNow after months and an image he says the graft survived and is ready for implant.\n\nHowever, I still experience dull deep pain from that area from time to time.  It could be lingering sinus issues which are flaring up.  It could be psychosomatic due to the gap in my teeth.\n\nWhat i am concerned is that there is a lingering issue, maybe deep persistent infection, nerve damage, something like that.  So that when he does the implant, it flares up and I end up with a failed implant and then cascading into a bridge, with no guarantee that does not continue with the failures.\n\nMy life experience is that I am that one-in-a-million person who has the rare side effects and adverse outcomes, especially on elective surgeries. I am the guy who gets the dry socket after a routine extraction.\n\nAdvice and comments are appreciated.\nThanks."

I replaced it with a bridge, but lately I've noticed that my jawline is not as defined/strong as it once was. So upon research on tooth extraction, I've been reading things like When teeth are missing, the alveolar bone, or the portion of the jawbone that anchors the teeth in the mouth, no longer receives the necessary stimulation, and begins to break down, or resorb. The body no longer uses or \"needs\" the jawbone, so it deteriorates and goes away. The rate the bone deteriorates, as well as the amount of bone loss that occurs, varies greatly among individuals. However, most loss occurs within the first eighteen months following the extraction, and continues throughout life. \" and \"Bone height loss can be up to 1.5 mm in 3 months and decrease in the width of alveolar ridge can be as much as 50 percent within 12 months. Even with complete healing, there is generally some erosion or resorption that can lead to shorter and thinner surrounding bone than compared to prior extraction. This can cause gum tissue defect which can lead to significant cosmetic and functional problems.\" so now I'm freaking out. If the above were to actually happen I would look a little like my grandma.. \n\nno but seriously I've been depressed lately because one of my favorite features is my bold jawline, and having to slowly watch it get sucked away... and look like a potatoe.. isn't something I'd wish on even my enemy. \n\nAdvice please"

    "dialogue": "Tiffany: Main question: If I don't see clotting, but the bleeding stopped after oral surgeon put foam into socket, does that mean I'll get dry socket? How long until it would dissolve and cause dry socket to occur? Now on to the details!\n\nI went to the dentist on Monday to get two teeth extracted (#2 & #30, I believe). The upper molar (#2) was just fine the next day, but for two days following the extraction the lower one was still bleeding as if it were the first day. Some of the bleeding was coming from the tooth in front of the extraction as well. I went back the day after the extraction and the dentist noticed the bleeding from the tooth in front, and said this was from my gums which aren't the healthiest, and that the extraction site itself seemed to be clotting okay. I went back the second day because it was bleeding just as bad if not worse, and he sent me to an oral surgeon who filled it with some sort of foam and stitched me up. He did say that some of the bleeding seemed to be coming from the tooth in front, so he stitched between that tooth and the one in front of it as well.\n\nHow does this foam stuff work? From what I've read, the foam just absorbs the blood to help it clot. What worries me (& I do get worried easily) is that I don't see a clot at all! It honestly just looked like my normal gums with stitches all over, only 2 hours after I left the surgeon. It still looks like that today, two days after I saw the surgeon, but there's also a lot of white tissue now which I'm guessing/hoping is the granulation tissue. \n\n*******I mean, the foam stopped the bleeding, but since I don't see any red/blood, should I be concerned that once the foam dissolves that I'll have dry socket? What if the bleeding for the first two days was PURELY from the tooth in front, so when the surgeon cleaned out the socket to put the foam in, the socket wasn't bleeding anymore to produce another clot?********\n\nI think that's all! I can add any information if it seems I missed something. I've called the dentist a bunch throughout this past week, and they probably think I'm the most annoying patient. They seem to brush me off a little too so I don't know how serious they take me now after I ask so many questions! I've just heard such horrible things about dry socket that I'm petrified to get it, especially since I have work the next three days and wouldn't know what to do if this occurred at work and I don't have coverage for me to go home!"

The root canals are actually from trauma I suffered about 15 years ago; hit by a car while running. The rest of my body was FINE---only my mouth took a hit!

There are lots advancement in this procedure, depending on your need or lost teeth like All on 4 dental implants, all on 6 and all on 8 dental implants. If you will ask me i prefer to have these treatment done in Mexico. To give you some insight about the cost of each treatment here: For All on 8 dental implants in Mexico it ranges from $7200 - $10,500 this may be costly because of the number of implants. For All on 6 dental implants it costs $5,400 and $3600 for all on 4 dental implants in Mexico. I thinkk this can give you an insight how much you may spent for the said procedure also you can look into other countries like Costa Rica and India or in your country."

This caused me to do research, and upon all the reading I've done online, this site in particular freegrab.net/Dental%20tooth%2... has me freaking out because I've read \"missing teeth cause changes in the jaw bone structure. The bone that supported the missing teeth begins to shrink or thin away. There is a loss of width and height of the jaw bone. The process is referred to as bone resorption. This is a natural process of your body saving bone nutrients and structure it is no longer using. Jaw bone loss happens most rapidly during the first year of tooth loss and is four times greater in the lower jaw than in the upper. When a tooth is lost, the lack of stimulation causes loss of the jaw bone. There is a 25% decrease in width of jaw bone during the first year after tooth loss and an overall 4 millimeters decrease in height over the next few years. Without chewing pressure to stimulate the bone, the jawbone begins to dissolve away immediately after extraction and continues forever unless an implant is placed. \" \n\nI love the shape of my face, my jaw in particular really compliments my features. It's bold and wide, I wouldn't modify it if I got payed. So reading this really has me anxious. I have gotten my temporary bridge today. The reason I got a bridge instead is because the tooth on the left needed a crown anyway, and I read various stories about mental, neurological problems as well as physical developing from tooth implants. It also cost me a thousand dollars less which was convenient. However reading all of this stuff online has me regretting the choice I made  I was thinking of asking my dentist if I could do an implant instead. I read this on the link that I provided \"How Implants Stop Bone Loss: Dental implants fused and integrated into the jaw-bone serve as anchors to support teeth. They function the same as natural teeth in that the implant provides pressure stimulus on the opposite side tooth.  As you may recall, bone needs stimulation to stay healthy. An implant-supported tooth, or teeth, allow for normal function of the whole jaw including the nerves, muscles and jaw joints. Moreover dental implants fuse to the bone, stabilizing and stimulating it to maintain its dimension and density.\" Therefore apparently, contrary to what I first believed, a bridge does not stimulate the bone or prevent bone loss, and there is no stimulus on the opposite side tooth.\n\nHelp please. What would you do in my situation? And what is the long-term outcome of my decision?"

Zuri Barniv: Some dentures can snap on and off implants, this is called an \"overdenture\". Some dentures are permanently connected to the implants, this is called a \"hybrid\". There is an enormous difference in cost because of the enormous difference in time, energy and expertise needed to do hybrid dentures."

    "dialogue": "JohnZ622: Hi everyone,\n\nOn August 15th I had extraction of 3 mesioangular impacted unerupted wisdom teeth (3 was all I had).  They were the upper left (#16) and the two bottom ones.\n\nAbout four days after the extraction, I noticed a small pus pocket near my remaining upper left molars (around #15).  The pain grew until it became a huge headache and I was prescribed antibiotics.\nThe antibiotics eventually calmed down the infection. However, during the process I noticed that the leftover upper left molars (#15, 14) feel numb.  When I touched them, they felt like stones.  It also hurt a bit when I bit down on them.\n\nAbout six weeks after the surgery, I went to my general dentist for routine cleaning.  He noticed the abscess and proceeded to perform a vitality test on #15 and #14.  They were both completely unresponsive to cold.\n\nI followed up with the oral surgeon.  He commented that the abscess/pus pocket is not over the wisdom teeth but rather over #15.  The conclusion he reached was that the negative vitality test could not have been caused by the extraction.\n\nIs this too co-incidental?  These two teeth never gave me problems before.  I do remember him thinking that the pus pocket was the location of a flap that he opened during the surgery.  Now I have been recommended to seek root canal for both of those teeth.\n\nThank you so much for reading this.  Please share any advice you have."

    "dialogue": "Wisdom73: Well as I sit here recovering, thought I would share my story since before my procedure I had searched online for people in similar situation as myself but couldn't find much. Of course though I just found this forum which looks like there are lots of different implant tales, just not sure how many folks have had them removed.\n\nMy story is I have a genetic condition called ectodermal dysplasia which can manifest itself in many different ways from hair, nails, and in my case teeth. I was born with all my baby teeth, but only had seeds for 12 adult teeth. So as a kid when those adult teeth came in, it was decided to extract all the other baby teeth that did not adult teeth to replace them. I had that done and then was given partials that clasped to the teeth I did still have.\n\nHad those for 5 years or so until about 1989-1990, which is about the time when dental implants were approved for use in the US. My dentist proposed placing 10 dental implants, 3 on each side on the upper, 2 on each side in the lower. In order to have this done I had to undergo a sinus lift procedure to beef up the upper jawbone to place the implants in, and then my nerve in my lower jaw had to be moved so the lower implants wouldn't interfere with it. When all was said and done, I did get to finish out my senior year of high school with a nice new shiny set of teeth and was one of the first dental implants patients.\n\nNow fast-forward roughly 20 years. I began noticing some swelling and discharge from the upper right side. I took an antibiotic and it went away. About a year later, it flares up again. I did this back and forth with it for about 5 years. My old surgeon with the dental group I was with passed away, and replacement surgeon drops a bomb on me and says the implants in that area a infected and need to come out, and not just those but he wants to remove all the implants and then give me all new ones. I jumped ship and found a new implant specialist in the area who came highly recommended.\n\nMy new surgeon attempted to save these troubled implants last year with a periodontal flap procedure and bone grafting and guided tissue regeneration. The problem implant area had lost significant bone due to the infection. It took for about 6 months, but then came back again. I had lost so much bone that the implants were mostly exposed now. They were first generation implants which had a slot in the base of the implant to allow bone to integrate to the implant. Mine were so exposed that slot was have uncovered with part of it still recessed in the bone, the other half exposed which created a cavity for infection to continue.\n\nSo plan was to remove them. My new surgeon was concerned that the jawbone in this area is so weak, that removal by individually twisting them out could possibly cause a fracture. He went in with the whole crown still attached to the 3 implants, and basically cut them out of the bone and removed as one piece. He then used two packages of freeze dried bone to try and reinforce the jaw in that area as there wasn't much bone left. \n\nNow recovering, and just glad that it is over with. My side of my face swelled up like a balloon and my eye was swelled shut but that has finally gone down as well and my face is almost looking normal again. 6 months to recover and see how the bone is doing. Surgeon wants to eventually give me another sinus lift and new implants on that side. I am however opting just to do a partial for those teeth, then care for my remaining implants so hopefully they never need to removed. Wisdom73: Update. Suddenly noticed yesterday a new firm lump swelling in my cheek. It's in an area where it does appear to be in the cheek itself, not on the gums where they extracted the implants. Still, told the dentist who then wanted to see me immeditately. Went in, and he says the antibiotics I'm on aren't effective enough. I'm allergic to penicillin, so was on biaxin. Was on my way for a fun weekend at the race track when I stopped to see him. He lanced the cyst right there and squeezed on the lump to push all the fluid out...and pushed hard. Even when numbed, this was excruciatingly painful. Now on clindamycin instead, and had to cancel this weekends plans. He says I also should consider staying home from work another week to allow my body to heal. Not fun, not fun at all."

Ideally, I would be opting for placing implants to replace tooth #12 and #15 and creating a bridge to replace #13 and #14. My dentist says that it won't possible because I have too much bone loss over where tooth#12 used to be and the only solution is to create a natural tooth and implant supported bridge.\nIs that only option I have? What else can be done here? I'm scared of connecting a healthy tooth with a implant because I've read that most dentists don't recommend it. Zuri Barniv: Don't connect a natural tooth to an implant, that is something that usually ends badly. You are better off doing a bone graft where #12 is so an implant can be supported there instead. VitaminA: Thank you for the answer to my question. My dentist says I don't have enough existing bone around #12 to do a bone graft. What can I do in this situation? Do I have any other options left? Zuri Barniv: I can't think of many situations where a bone graft cannot be done in the #12 area to allow for an implant. The technical terms for what you MIGHT need is a \"block graft\" or a \"sinus lift\", and if you sent an x-ray I could tell you more. But your dentist may not be able to do some of these procedures as they are more advanced, so is telling you there is no option for it. This is why you need a second opinion from someone like an oral surgeon. Also, an implant supported bridge from #12-15 is longer than I would personally feel comfortable with, but if #12 was a natural tooth which was in poor shape, there is no way I would consider connecting it to an implant in the #15 position."

I visited the dentist day after, he said it is very unusual and no idea why it is happening. He removed the temp crown cleaned it up, put more bone graft and put back the temp.  Today, my temp is fully covered with soft blood clot. I still have pain but manageable with ibuprofen.  My dentist says he has never seen something like this and inquiring in his circle and dental forums.\n\nAny inputs are greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nRavi Zuri Barniv: This looks like something called a liver clot. It happens occasionally and there are many reasons this can happen - they are beyond the scope of a layman forum. Suffice it to say, your medical history needs to be reviewed carefully and if you haven't had a complete blood count in many years, that can be done to rule out some systemic issues. You might also be having a reaction to the bone graft, the gums weren't sutured well or some foreign body may still be trapped under the gums like a piece of tooth, a bone splinter or something else which prevents the site from clotting properly. The list of possible causes goes on and on...If you are in the USA and this was not done by an oral surgeon, now would be the time to consult one. Ravikanth: Thanks Dr.Barniv.  I do not think dentist is an Oral Surgeon. But all these guys do are implants.  Anyways, i consulted my PCP to do a blood test.  The reports came in today. I see following which are high but my PCP says it is ok. I am not convinced, would you know what this means?\n\nFollowing are above normal:\n\nMyelocyte %(complete blood work) = > 1 normal value suggested as 0%\nAbs Myelocyte(complete blood work) = > 0.1 normal value suggested as 0 K/uL\nBilirubin Total (from liver panel test)  => 1.3 normal is suggested as <1.1 mg/dL\n\nDo you see any correlation or pattern here?\n\nDo you recommend me to consult Hematologist?\n\nThanks,\nRavi Zuri Barniv: I am not qualified to interpret the CBP so if your doctor said it is ok, we need to go with that. If all these guys do is implants, I'm surprised they have never encountered this before. It is not that unusual, just not common. Are you located in the USA? Ravikanth: Yes. i am in USA. Zuri Barniv: Not sure if the matter is resolved by now or at least getting better, but if it is still a problem, I would recommend getting the advice of an oral surgeon. Ravikanth: Well, the bleeding stopped. The \"liver clot\" is slowly receding. I still have some discomfort and slight pain but I can deal with it. I am making sure that tooth is not touched by food or anything else.  \n\nI am now much worried about my blood work. My physician says it is OK but i am not convinced. Especially with Myelocyte% (related to cancer sometimes).  My Monocyte % (related to auto immune disease) is also increasing since 2009.

    "title": "Sore throat and tongue after wisdom tooth extraction",
    "dialogue": "advil_lover: Hi,\n\nNo doubt a similar question has been asked before, but here goes.\n\nI am a 56 year old male in good health. Six days ago I had my lower right wisdom tooth extracted. The tooth had developed normally but was shaped to hold a crown. The crown came loose and the dentist recommended extraction because there wasn't enough tooth above the gumline to effectively re-cement the crown.\n\nIt was a difficult extraction because there wasn't much tooth above the gumline. The dentist had trouble gripping the tooth, and in the end split the tooth in two pieces so she could grasp and remove each piece.\n\nThe day after the extraction I developed a sore throat and the back of my tongue became sore. On the fourth day the pain became more severe in the area of the socket. The tissue behind the socket was swollen and tender. My throat is tender under the jaw on the right side. I went back to the dentist and she diagnosed dry socket. She packed the socket with something that smells like cloves. She thinks the lymph nodes in the throat are inflammed and prescribed Amoxicillin 3 x 500 mg daily to treat that. I have been on the Amoxicillin for 24 hours without any improvement yet. I am returning to her office daily to have the socket repacked.\n\nThe pain around the socket eases following the treatment with the clove pack. But the throat and tongue pain remains intense, particularly the throat. It is difficult to swallow and talk. When I speak it feels like the back of my tongue is swollen. I'm almost constantly salivating. I am taking 600 mg of Advil every 4-6 hours. Once the Advil wears off the pain intensifies and I become very uncomfortable.\n\nToday when I saw the dentist for the 2nd repacking the Advil was wearing off. During her inspection she put finger pressure on the back of my tongue and the pain was so intense that I held my breath and the back of my calves perspired leaving droplets of sweat on the plastic covering the dental exam chair. The dentist prescribed Tylenol 3 to help with pain management.\n\nI need to speak on my job and I can't so I've had to take the past couple of days off.\n\nI'm wondering what others think might be going on here. Is the treatment regiment appropriate? Is it normal to have this level of pain for almost one week? Are these symptoms to be expected? When can I expect to recover?\n\nI'm concerned. advil_lover: A follow up on this, it so happens that I developed an infection as well as dry socket. I am on two antibiotics and after five days they finally started to have an effect. Pain is reduced enough now that I can swallow without the searing pain I had a few days ago. The infection affected my tongue, causing painful bumps or sores on its surface at the far back. Last night I reached way back with my index finger and felt them. I'll remain on the antibiotics until they are finished. Also I am referred to an oral surgeon for a second opinion. \n\nI read on wikipedia that dry socket can be caused by a difficult extraction and this is surely what happened to me because the dentist worked on the tooth for almost an hour. Zuri Barniv: Yes, that could be, but sometimes dry sockets happens for no reason at all. No one really knows what causes them, but they do occur more after difficult extractions. I know you are not a women, but they also tend to occur more in females and those on birth control pills especially (double the risk) due to higher estrogen levels. This is why women should probably wait to have teeth extracted till around the end of their menstrual cycle when estrogen levels are lowest."

Zuri Barniv: It is not medically necessary to get any kind of sedation for oral surgery, but in some cases it can make it a lot nicer for you. With local anesthetics alone (shots in your mouth), you should not feel anything the surgeon is doing except for the sensation of pressure. By the way, you probably don't mean \"general anesthesia\" which is usually done in a hospital by an anesthesiologist and a machine breathes for you. Most likely you are referring to \"IV sedation\" which is done in the dentist's office, you are semi-conscious but mostly asleep and, the big thing, is you breathe on your own without the help of a machine. BIG difference between the two terms. Unless you are getting something exceptional done in your mouth (and it doesn't sound like you are), the insurance is very unlikely to pay for IV sedation if your policy doesn't cover it. cathypatten: Thank you for your reply,and ya think your right,looking at my papers and it says general anesthesia but below it it explains given through a vein and total loss of consciousness.Anyways guess I assumed being put out was absolutely necessary because thats what the surgeon said needed to be done,so is it possible to ask the surgeon to just give me local?(and hopefully it will be covered,or at least a little cheaper if I do have to pay it) Zuri Barniv: Hmmm....well, I just want to emphasize that IV Conscious Sedation is very different than general anesthesia. Your papers should say \"IV Sedation\", \"Conscious sedation\" or something like that. You are technically conscious when you get this, unlike general anesthesia where you are unconscious. There is also a HUGE difference in cost between the two as well. I would clarify exactly what this office is planning to do. And if they were planning to, indeed, do general anesthesia, that would be way overkill for some tooth extractions."

    "dialogue": "PPGJR: In December 2013 I started the dental implant process on my front tooth and this also coincided with braces for my top front 6 teeth.  I have been with my Dentist since 2001 and up to this point I have had zero complaints and we have a great relationship.  So when I was told by my dentist that my Delta Dental PPO would not cover the implant and braces, I took his word for it at 100% trust that I was being given accurate information.  Overall, I ended up paying close to $6K out of pocket for the implant and braces.  Literally today, July 8, 2015, I called Delta Dental and found out that my Delta Dental PPO actually DOES cover a single tooth implant (up to $2500 cumulative lifetime) and orthodontics (up to $1000 cumulative lifetime).  I also learned that this coverage was available to me in December 2013 when the procedure was started.  Now, the problem with me getting reimbursed is that the procedure was started over 1 year ago and so Delta Dental says I would not be eligible for reimbursement, even if my dentist submits a claim retroactively.  \n\nNow, I have some questions for all of you:\n\nis it my responsibility as a Patient to double check the information that my dentist gave me - that the implant and the braces were not covered?  Or, was I within reason to take his word for it since I have a great relationship with him?\nAny solutions to the problem of not being reimbursed because the claim is over 1 year old?  We literally live paycheck to paycheck  and are severely struggling financially so the $3500 that I could have saved if my dentist filed the claims through my insurance would REALLY help me.  We wanted to take a small vacation to Disneyland for my children's birthdays in August but we can't afford it right now.  The $3500 would allow us to give our children that experience and so much more.\nPlease help me with your expertise, opinion and advice.\n\nThank you very much! Zuri Barniv: 1. Yes, the relationship is between you and the insurance. The dentist is not responsible for your insurance unless they are a DMHO/DMO Delta provider. Assuming they are Delta Premier or Delta PPO, then it's all on you. Keep in mind that even a great dentist with a wonderful and experienced staff can make mistakes. When dealing with this much money, you should always double check everything.\n2. Yes, try writing Delta an appeal letter. If you state the facts of the case, there is a better than zero chance they will consider making payment or partial payment. I would ask the dentist to write a letter you could attach stating it was no fault of yours and would support your appeal. If that doesn't work, escalate it and keep appealing as much as the law allows. It only costs you a stamp and you have nothing to lose.\n\nOne last thought. Even when I know for sure a procedure is not covered by Delta, I still submit the claim just in case. I have had many situations when Delta made payment even when the claims representative said it would not be covered. This is why most all dentists submit a claim for expensive treatment even when it seems pointless. One question to your dentist is: \"don't you always submit a claim for everything you do and especially for very expensive treatment?\". Had he done this, you would have gotten a pleasant surprise when the check came in.\n\nKeep us updated on what happens. PPGJR: Thank you very much for your reply Zuri.  I really appreciate it and it makes a lot of sense.\n\nThis is good to know for future reference and I consider it a lesson learned.  I'm sure my dentist will consider it a lesson learned for him and his staff as well.\nI completely intend on writing as many appeal letters as necessary until they tell me to stop.  Great advice to have my dentist write a letter to vouch for me as well.  I have been loyal to his practice for 14 years so I am hopeful that he would do this for me. \nAnother great piece of advice for my dentist.  He is currently working on my case to see what he can do but if it doesn't work out, I will ask him that question as part of the learning process for all of us.\n\nI will keep the forum posted on the outcome and ongoings.  Thank you very much once again!"

I am in so much pain and was just told to go away and come back in 7 days.  Thanks Zuri Barniv: Dry sockets require almost daily attention by the dentist for those 7 days. The swelling and pain probably have nothing to do with the clove oil (I cannot know that for sure, but it is unlikely). You need to get more attention to this problem by the dentist.

    "dialogue": "shak_ka: My bottom two Wisdom teeth are impacted, see below image link.\n\nI have already been to two different oral surgeons to enquire about whether they should be removed, and they both recommend it, but they were unable to estimate whether it would cause me problems in the future if I decide against having them removed.\n\nThese impacted teeth have never caused me any pain or discomfort. I heard that the main reason people get them removed (don't quote me on source) is the difficultly of brushing them, however, as my Wisdom teeth are not poking through the gum (and I assume never will?) I guess this wouldn't be a problem for me?\n\nAbout me: 27 years old, somewhat poor history of dental hygeine - i.e. lots of cavities and fillings. Oral surgeon says my removal would be \"difficult\" due to the close proximity to nerves.\n\nLooking for opinions. Thank you! Only reason I'm asking is that I don't want to spend the thousands of dollars on extraction if it's really unnecessary.\n\nxray image\n\nP.S. This article states: \"Little evidence exists to support removing impacted wisdom teeth that are not causing pain and swelling, aren’t negatively affecting other teeth, and are disease-free, finds a new review in The Cochrane Library.\" which makes my decision even more confusing. shak_ka: Bump, please, anyone? Zuri Barniv: The reason to remove your wisdom teeth has nothing to do with how easily you can brush them. The problem with your wisdom teeth is that they press up against the second molars in a way that can create a pocket in your gums. Bacteria can enter that pocket and potentially cause an infection. Yes, the key word here is \"potentially\". Also, decay can more easily form on the back side of your second molars when a wisdom tooth is pressed up next to it. The bottom line here is risk. There exists risk in removing your wisdom teeth, but there is also risk in leaving them. No one can tell you precisely what will happen. It comes down to the opinion of the surgeon you talk to, but most surgeons recommend what they do best...surgery. Keep in mind that as you get older (especially over age 35) removing wisdom teeth becomes harder and more risky. It is better to deal with them early if possible. Looking at your x-ray, I think your risk is moderate for a problem over your lifetime. I would recommend a cone beam x-ray (3D x-ray) to better evaluate the situation and the proximity of an important nerve they seem to contact. If you find a highly skilled oral surgeon who takes the time to review such an x-ray and who takes the time to explain things to you, that is a good start. It sounds like the surgeons you saw didn't have the time to educate you and that's not a great sign, in my opinion. I would remove them if it was me, but only with a conscientious and careful surgeon who has weighed all the risks, benefits and alternatives with me. If nothing else, you don't need to rush into it and you can take your time to figure it out. Hope that helps.\nDr. Barniv shak_ka: Thank you so much for the detailed reply! I went to get the opinions of two oral surgeons, and only one of them suggested that I get a CT Scan done, so I will likely go with him has he seems more careful. shak_ka: I've attached a few snippets from my CT Scan that my surgeon had requested. http://i.imgur.com/OmpUlL4.jpg (Topogram) http://i.imgur.com/GTFSlXV.jpg (Mandible Axial) http://i.imgur.com/w2T0rg3.jpg (Mandible Axial) Sorry, I'm certainly no radiologist or oral expert, so I'm not sure if these shots are actually helpful.\n\nAfter any opinions. Thank you very much! Zuri Barniv: Unfortunately, these are not useful slices. You would want to show images that display what it would look like if someone was facing you and they peeled back the jaw bone in the area around the wisdom tooth. Either way, it is a moot point because the oral surgeon that ordered it is the best qualified to interpret the results and convey the info to you.\nDr. Barniv"

    "dialogue": "Eric2005: I had a molar extracted by an oral surgeon around 11 AM Wednesday.   Dentist also did prep for future implant.   It's 2 AM Friday and I just woke up with pain.  I have been taking pain killers ever since the extraction.  This is the first time an extraction has resulted in ongoing pain.  Is this normal? I am concerned. Nimita: One can expect some degree of pain after tooth extraction. It usually lasts for a week and the region still remains tender for few more days. The reason that you still had pain maybe because it must have developed a dry socket. Swelling peaks after the second day but starts decreasing thereafter. Persistent swelling suggests an infection. After extraction of the wisdom tooth or complicated extractions, slight bleeding may occur after three days. Continue warm saline rinsing and avoid smoking to prevent delayed healing."

But Nobel implants are more widely known and those are the kind I place myself. Zirconia crowns are fine. The more important piece is called an \"abutment\" which is what goes between the implant and the crown, They can also be made of zirconia but I recommend having it made from titanium. kev313: My understanding is that there are different dentistry tools for different brand and of course different accessories.... it would be easier for you to switch to a different dentist in the future.....

    "title": "Having all four wisdoms extracted. General/local anesthesia? Very scared",
    "dialogue": "yo0123yo: I am 27 years old , about one year ago I was made aware by my then dentist that it would be in my best interest to have all four of my wisdom teeth extracted. They are not impacted and have come up but not completely, so this leaves a little flaps of skin that sometimes will bleed if I bite down too hard or even from brushing my wisdoms, since they are only like 75% erupted. Last week I had another dentist appointment and had two cavities filled and she also suggested that it would probably be better while I'm still \"young\" and under 30 and she gave me a referral to an oral surgeon which I am sitting in the waiting room at now. I am pretty scared. I definitely don't want to be awake for it. Can anyone describe the process and how your experience was? Do they usually extract all four in one visit? Also I am worried about pain even though I heard they give hydrocodone after, the reason why I am worried is because I take opiates recreationally so should I let the doctor know this and therefore ask for oxycodone? Don't really want to be looked at as a drug seeker when I will be needing them for pain. This is going to be my first surgery I'm so nervous. yo0123yo: Just left the office and the xray ended up showing four partially erupted wisdom teeth and then there is one that is impacted (or a tooth like mass), it is small and right next to my top left wisdom tooth. The dentist recommended general anesthesia and to be done in 2-4 weeks. Will attach the xrays when I get home. yo0123yo: In this Xray of my mouth you can see the mass I am talking about in the upper right hand corner right next to the wisdom tooth. It's not even causing me pain, should I still have it done? So scared lol yo0123yo: I just thought of this... that tooth is just barely barely popping out of my gums(top right in the photo). I notice on the xray that the right side of the xray has a bigger \"mass\"? Is that tissue or is that my jawbone?? The worst news I could here would be that my jaw needs to be drilled in to. lol oh wow. Sorry guys I'm just so nervous its my first time ever getting any kind of surgery and of course drilling/cutting a tooth out of my jawbone would be my first surgery. AnnMarie: You should be fine seeing they are so close to the surface. I had three pulled when they started to abscess and caused ear and throat pain. Not all at once but a few years apart The worst was the bottom left and that was mainly because the dentist didn't put a stitch in and I lost the clot and got dry socket. It was HORRIBLE! I still have one in my upper cheek that they refuse to remove. They were all in deep in my head. Trust, you'll be good."

I'm having the procedure with IV sedation (because I don't tolerate nitrous oxide). Just wondering if anyone else here has had this done, & what should I expect? I've had my wisdom teeth removed, with IV sedation, & that was a fairly easy process to recover from. The dentist told me the initial procedure that places the implants will require a healing period of about 2-3 months, during which time I will still be able to wear my flipper/bridge to conceal the gap in my front. I'm actually looking forward to this because the flipper is VERY uncomfortable to wear for more than a few minutes at a time, & I can't eat with it in at all. Basically it just lets me get through day to day until my procedure. So what can I expect from the procedure pain-wise, & are they usually pretty successful? The dentist told me he had never had one fail yet (knock on wood). It's my understanding that the surgery will involved placing screws in my bone, that will then have to heal & meld to the bone, & after that's completed, then they can just screw in the crowns into those. Is that right?"

That does not mean it intersects it in reality. What I mean is that you are looking at a 3D object in 2D. The nerve may be very close and your risk is very high or the nerve is farther away and you will probably be fine. There is no way to tell with this x-ray. In the United States, the standard of care dictates that you get a 3D x-ray (cone beam x-ray) in order to see what is really going on there. Without that, all any dentist can tell you is the risk exists and that the risk is real (not theoretical). I would insist on a 3D x-ray and I would only see a surgeon who has experience with these issues and agrees a 3D x-ray is needed here. I would not go to a surgeon just because he tells you it will be OK. Firas: thank you very much dear Barniv for the clear answer,\nso you think that I really need 3D X ray I hop they can do it in Turkey I will visit the dentist again and asking for a 3D X Ray \nplease don't hesitate to tell me in case of nerve damage will I stay for the rest of my life without feeling in the right down part of my lip ?\n\nwhat if they will tell me that they don't use 3D X ray in Turkey ? what I have to do ?\nthere is no chance to know the real risk from just this panoramic picture ? Zuri Barniv: Yes, I really think you need a 3D (cone beam) x-ray. Nerve damage could cause you to lose all sensation in your lip and chin on the lower right side, but it could also cause pain to occur there, which is actually worse than being numb. The risk is there. You cannot know the risk from just a 2D panoramic x-ray. There is a good chance your dentist will tell you they don't do 3D x-rays even though I know for sure they have the machines in Turkey. If you are in Istanbul, Ankara or other big city, I would be surprised if you can't find a surgeon who has experience with this and access to such a machine. In the USA, it costs about $300 to take this x-ray. \n\nRead this for more information on cone beams x-rays in Turkey: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3528136/ Firas: thank you very much for your Answer dear,\nnow I'm worrying more then any time before, \nI can't imagine the horrible causes that can happen to me in case of a bad surgery \nI'm living in Eskisehir but I will go to a big city to save my self \n\nactually the doctor did a different film for me, but when I went back home I checked the file I found he filmed the wrong place  \nI will share the picture with you \n\nI will find a way to get a 3D Xray before the surgery or I will cancel the meeting with that doctor\nreally I appreciate every advice \nthank you very much \nas soon I will get the 3D X ray I will share it with you Zuri Barniv: By the way, you do have a very deep cavity on your lower left molar 3rd tooth from the back and a moderate cavity on the tooth behind that one. You will probably need a root canal done on the deepest one to fix it. Firas: thank you very much dear Barniv yes the Cavity already hurting me and I got a meeting to repair it, any way I dot a 3d Xray and it is in a CD I made Iso file and I will upload it and send you the link \nthank you very much dear for your help I really appreciate it Firas: the link of the ISO file of the CD is\n\nhttp://ovh.to/T8q5Thc\n\nand this is a short Video that I did to show you the position of the nerve \nI think I'm ok what do you think ???? Zuri Barniv: The video is not helpful. Can you show me pictures where you see the tooth and the nerve in cross sections - like what you would see if you were looking through the jaw bone. That program you have should be able to do that. If you want, upload the files and I will run it on my program. The files should be in a DICOM format and there may be a few hundred of them in the folder. Firas: Thank you for the answer dear,\nI uploaded an iso file,  I mean virtual cd image\nIf you have \nPower iso, deomon tools or magic iso you can see the cd,\nOr if you have CD burning software you can burn the iso file in a cd, \nI prefer that you use the cd and see well because I'm not specialist in reading tomography, and in the cd there is many settings like adjusting image setting, display soft tissue, changing lighting, \nPlease, help me to know the real situation of my nerve because when I will go to a doctor I want to be ready and know every thing to be sure that he is doing every thing right \nNow I'm using my phone when I will go back home I will try to check the DICOM files\nBut the cd that the doctor gave to me run automatically with luncher Firas: I found DCM file in a folder called Images may be this file you need it\nI shared some pictures that I think they are useful \n\nand this is the link for the DCM file\n\nhttp://ovh.to/Y7eqak9\n\ndo you thing that I will be OK ?\nthank you really for every thing Firas: I found an easy way to send to you my 3d Xray \n1) download the file \"tomography.zip\" from this link  -click here to download-\n2) unzip the file \n3) you will find a file called \"Romexis_Viewer.exe\" double click on it \n4) \n\n\nthen you will find a window like that \n\n\n \n\nselect the english languge then click start viewer from the cd and finally you will be able to see the 3d x ray and control it like you want Zuri Barniv: Mohamed, it is hard for me to see clearly without the DICOM files and I don't want to install anything on my computer. The bottom line is the 3D x-ray needs to be used and interpreted by the surgeon doing the work. The nerve is very close to the tooth. An unskilled and inexperienced surgeon will cause damage there even if they have a 3D x-ray. The best advice I can give you is to see a surgeon that is familiar with 3D x-rays, takes the risk here seriously and explains to you their experience in this matter. If you are satisfied with their response, I would go forward. Obviously, any surgeon who has this 3D x-ray has a big advantage because they know the best way to remove the tooth and minimize your risk. Firas: thank you for the clear answer doctor sorry for the inconvenient, I think DICOM files are special for your software and I'm sure I have no DICOM file, but I looked for a tutorial how to use my software and I found this picture is it more useful ? Zuri Barniv: Yes, these views are much more useful, but my original advice from my last post remains unchanged. You need to work with an experienced and skilled surgeon to minimize your risk and they need to use this 3D x-ray when planning your extraction."

During the extraction (it was one of my upper molars) the tooth broke apart and the dentist told me he had to extract the 3 roots separately. One of them wasn't frozen and had to be frozen 3 times. I was soooo happy when it was finally over.... \n\nI went home and immediately when the freezing came out I could feel a lump in my upper gum where it attaches to the side of my face.. the lump is painful and has not moved or lessened in 2 weeks. The lump is above the last tooth in my upper jaw NEXT to the extraction site. I went back to the dentist but the check up was done by a different dentist and when I asked him what's jabbing into my cheek he said \"bone\"..... to which I asked \"bone??\" but received no explanation and was sent home with some clindamycin (antibiotics).\n\nYesterday I was brave and put my finger in to feel around and the thing jabbing into the side of my face ISexposed jawbone!!! No one told me this happened - How does this happen?? - It's not even near the extraction but over the other tooth next to it! -- I am SICK that neither of the dentists told me about it or why I've been in such pain = Will the skin grow back over the jawbone???

Zuri Barniv: Don't let this get you so upset, you will be fine. It is probably not as bad as it feels. When we do difficult extractions, sometimes a piece of the jaw bone can break off. Sometimes we see it and clean it out and sometimes we don't and it is noticed later. Exposed bone in your mouth is not a big deal in the short term, but you do need to get it looked at and treated. The treatment is usually to numb the area and clean the area where it happened. I understand you are scared, but you need to get it looked at.

The owner of the dental institute saw me and told me that my upper jaw bone IS exposed, and it is not where the tooth was extracted. She explained that the dentist had to create a 'flap' over the extraction site, but I don't know how that has anything to do with the part of my jaw bone which is exposed since the exposed bone is above the tooth behind the extraction and above it.\n\nShe also told me that if the skin doesn't grow back they will need to shave down the bone. She says that usually they put people in my predicament on hydro morphine.  I barely take the Ty3's they gave me because I don't like narcotics and they make me ill. \n\nAdditionally, she acknowledged that her 2 male dentists did not educate me as to what was going on and wants me to call her in a week to check in with her.  I've noticed that men do not seem to know how to provide information the way women do.  I will never go to a male dentist again."

I have never had a tooth extracted so I am not sure if this is part of the normal healing process. My dentist did tell me that the roots were extremely long and he had to do ALOT of pulling to get both roots all the way out. Zuri Barniv: Is the numbness just on your lower left chin and lip or on your upper lip and cheek as well? Overall, your symptoms do not sound normal for 30 days post treatment. I would wonder if you have contacted your dentist yet?\nDr. Barniv Leona Wyatt: No .. It is my upper jaw almost right at the joint where the upper and lower jaw meet and the numbness is my whole left cheek almost to my ear but not my chin at all Zuri Barniv: Leona, this sounds like something associated with your jaw joint which is near your ear. It is unusual to feel numbness after a difficult extraction but it can happen. If the doctor presses very hard against your jaw during the extraction, it can cause aggravate the joint and cause problems.It's impossible to diagnose you in a forum. You need to make an appointment to have the doctor evaluate you. If this doctor was not an oral surgeon, then I would definitely consult one."

    "dialogue": "BLS: I had an upper molar (#14) extracted 4 months ago and am considering an implant. However, I am concerned about the safety of titanium implants after reading some academic journal articles about the risks associated with titanium corrosion (immune reactions, titanium debris making their way to other parts of the body and lymph nodes).\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0300571294902003\nhttp://www.actaodontologicalat.com/archivo/v22n1/fulltext/articulo1.pdf\nhttp://goo.gl/Gul1C9\nhttp://goo.gl/TKDsvb\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18561292\n\nIs zirconia a good alternative to titanium? I know there hasn't been a lot of long-term studies on zirconia dental implants, but I'd like to find out if anything conclusively negative has been found about the safety of efficacy of zirconia implants.\n\nHave zirconia implants been approved by the American Dental Association and other regulating agencies?\n\nThanks in advance. BLS: Forgot to ask what the ADA and other dental organizations think about these studies on corrosion and titanium. In light of these findings is titanium still a safer bet than zirconia?\n\nWhich would you choose if it's for yourself and your family and why? BLS: Bumping up and hoping someone might be able to answer my question. Zuri Barniv: The articles you cite are not all relevant as some discuss the interaction with an implant and the pieces that fit on top of it to make a crown. Others discuss theoretical problems with implant corrosion or under what conditions corrosion can occur. I did not have time to review them in detail but am not sure the one or two there actually discussing the health implications are from reputable peer-reviewed journals. All of them fail to cite ANY real health problems but only discuss the potential for them. Zirconia is not without issues, but the main one is the lack of studies over a long period of time. Zirconia implants are FDA approved and I don't know that the ADA has a specific position on anything like that. But keep in mind that just because the FDA approves something, it doesn't mean they have done long-term studies on every possible scenario or that they guarantee it is perfectly healthy. \n\nSuffice it to say that Grade-1 titanium (the kind implants are made from) remains one of the most biocompatible materials available and I have placed them in my friends and family without hesitation. I discuss materials more in my blog, if interested. \nwww.straightupdoc.com"

    "title": "Implant pain",
    "dialogue": "droopdog7: So I started my implant process nearly a year ago and it hopefully will come to a successful conclusion soon.  Anyway, I replaced a tooth on the lower jaw that had a root canal over 25 years ago.  A crown was never placed on it (no dinero) so over time is basically rotted.  When I finally made the decision to get an implant, I found out that an abscess had infected a large part of the bone below the tooth (requiring a significant grafting procedure).  Waiting the six to seven months, the graft was successful and an implant was inserted (with no abutment).  \n\nAfter four additional months post implant, I was finally deemed ready for the abutment and eventually the crown.  What I find curious is that when I had my 1 month and what became three month post implant visits, the dentist was somewhat surprised by the level of discomfort I had in the area when he applied pressure with that evil steel hook thingy.  I was surprised by his surprisement because I could not envision it not hurting?\n\nAnyway, having waited an additional month post implant because of the sensitivity in the area, I went into to get the abutment (which turned out to be removing the first screw and inserting the new one with abutment.  That was nearly a week ago and boy, was it not fun.  The dentist originally intended to remove the first implant and place the new one sans any numbing agent.  Terrified, I said okay.\n\nThe removal of the first screw was terrifying but fairly painless.  The placing of the new one though was not that way.  I mean, he was able to begin placing it but once it started to get tight, the pain shot down to my toes!  Again, the dentist was a bit surprised by my reaction.  And again, I cannot envision a scenario where that particular action would not be painful.  \n\nThey then when to a topical numbing agent (which did nothing) to the shot.  And even with the shot of novocaine, that final tightening reached the high pain category.  Okay, now after all this, here is my first semi-question.  The dentist seemed to infer that the pain was due to contact with the gum (or something like that?).  He would ask where it hurt, and frankly, it hurt everywhere.  The pain was difficult to locate and I was busy suffering, but it did not feel like just a gum issue.  Seemed to me to be the same as before (when he poked and prodded and one and three months).  What if, the pain was in the bone?  You know, the place that the screw was being tightened?  Is that significant in any way?\n\nSecond, I am a week post second implant screw (with abutment).  I am scheduled to go in next Monday for the crown but I have a hard time believing it won't be extremely painful because the area feels sensitive still.  It is supposed to heel in the next four days?  As a side note, when the second implant was placed, the dentist was about to take it out because he could not tighten much, even with novocaine, on account of me screaming in pain.  He was about to remove it he determined it was already a tight fit.  Maybe that is why I was screaming?  Anyway, I assume if I am still sensitive come next Monday, I need to tell him something, as I don't believe that crowns are generally placed using a numbing agent. adisa: hi;\nWell first of all ı have to say that I had the same problem around 3 years ago. Obviously I needed to get 8 implants (4 on the top and 4 on the bottom) and full mouth crown. What can I say I am young but my dad also lost his tooth really young. Anyway just because I was so afraid I decded to have only 1 for the beginning. The dentist sad the same think my bond was not enough strong to carry the implant so they put graft (new bond) and ı waited around 6 months. everything was ok. after 6 months ı got my implant but the think I didn t check for details. around 2 months later I got really huge pain. I went to dentist may be everyday to stop the pain but painkillers didin t work. I got the same oparaion as you had. they took of the implant and sad that I need a new one. I did not convinced about the reason why I had that crazy pain and why they ned to put a new one. Thats why I didn t accept to have another implant in the same place. \n\nAfter all I did big research about implantolojy let s say implants are different with the quality and size. Your dentist should check about all alerjic situations off you and find the true implant to put. While I was searching I found out one clinic in Turkey (surprisely so cheap) I called them and asked for all details. I checked for forum of clinic and talked to other pations. Finally I decided to go anyway I wanted to go for holiday too. They offered free transfer from airport and free accomndation. The hygiene surprised me and smiley faces. There were around 8 dentists but the surgeon was around 35-40 years old a kind man and really has fast hands. I waited for first 2 days before treatment and watched for pations who are coming mostly from England. Everything seemed ok to me. After 2 days I start with my treatment wıth 4 implant in a day and 4 for next day. The name was Qimplant made by German. \n(350£ for 1 implant)!!! \n\nAfter a week my implant operation done. I have to say that I am so happy now. I was gonna have porselen crowns in Spain but now I have zirconium jus because of the prices in Turkey  I paid around 100£ for one zirconium. \n\nEnd of the story, you never know what is the problem when you get pain. Do research and don t decide quick."

    "dialogue": "OxyMade: I'm 16, and as a very young child I got abused by my dentist and.. long story short I'm very hesitant with dental work. I The issue happened at around 6 or 7.. and I refused to go to a dentist.. April 2014 I finally got tired of all the tooth pain and decided to go and get everything fixed. I got a fantastic dentist and I have no problems letting him do anything. he's done a lot of deep fillings and a root canal. I don't care about it.. it doesn't make me nervous, I have no problem with getting injected with lidocaine because I'm so used to it. However when I first went in April 2014 my dentist and I made a sheet of everything that needed to be fixed and both of my second molars needed to be extracted. #18 is worse than the other one.\nIn fall 2015 I went to an oral surgeon to get them both extracted and the lidocaine alone wasn't enough for me when he attempted to pull them it felt like no lidocaine was there. I was told I could be knocked out.(I'm now realizing that it doesn't mean totally knocked out.. apparently it only makes you groggy and you don't remember anything) so I go back to the same oral surgeon and he puts the IV in me and that's all I remember until waking up and being sat up and he was done. I didn't know much that was going on when I \"awoke\", but the first thing I did was feel only #31(left side second molar) was out and I said why did you only take one out and he told me that he had to stop because I started flipping out and grabbed his arm while he was doing it and kicked one of the assistants and put her on workmen's comp. I was very confused because I didn't remember any of this. After recovery of the extraction I attempted to setup another appointment to extract #18 and he told me because of what happened he couldn't put me out because he could get sued so I tried again with just lidocaine and I couldn't do it. The oral surgeon then verbally abused me because I was having a hard time with the tooth and he was rushing on the last time he attempted to extract it and he was getting frustrated so I tried a new oral surgeon to see if they could put an IV in me, but that oral surgeon told the next one the situation so it didn't matter what oral surgeon I went to they could only use local. This next oral surgeon was very nice and so very patient with me I was so surprised, yet again I couldn't do it.. he said he couldn't inject anymore lidocaine into me yet as soon as he pulled on the tooth just the slightest it was just the absolute worst pain it felt like there was no lidocaine injected at all. A week after he tried last time I was in constant pain, they prescribed me tylenol 3.. after another week I stopped taking it and it was a horrible pain so I was always taking it and always having them prescribe it to me whenever it ran out. This was in December or January 2014/2015. A few weeks ago in April 2015 I just had a few more fillings done and while there my dentist asked me if he could take out the decay out of #18 to make it not hurt all the time and possibly easier to extract and I was very numb and not feeling any of the fillings.. usually I would say no in fear that I would feel pain, but I said go ahead. As he went I felt nothing. He also, took a lot of the tooth down because the sharp edges were cutting my tongue and cheek and when I left it didn't touch my cheek or my tongue so I was happy. A couple days after this appointment I realized what he did by taking all the decay out was make the tooth completely hollow exposing the nerve. Since then food gets in there every single time I eat something food gets stuck and I use a small pick with bristles as the end to get it out, I always stab my nerve. It's always a very bad constant ache. The tylenol 3 I mentioned earlier wasn't doing enough so they prescribed me vicodin and whenever I don't take it it just hurts constantly.. on friday I ran low and my dentist was on vacation so I had to wait until today Monday to get more and then he told me that he's prescribed me so much that he can't prescribe anymore.. now I have to just sit through constant pain and am trying to get the tooth extracted but, what should I do? I can't be given IV and it's so  much pain getting it pulled with just lidocaine, never mind how hesitant i am to even try with just lidocaine because I already know it's going to hurt?\nAny advice will be appreciated. Dentgr: Have they tried an intra-pdl syringe? OxyMade: I'm not sure what that is."

    "dialogue": "Lampetarian: Hi\n\n18 days ago I had to have my upper left 1st molar extracted after a failed root canal which was causing significant pain for several weeks, in the end I had to request it be extracted due to the pain. Since extraction I've continued to have several problems, firstly it got infected needing a couple of courses of antibiotics to resolve. Now it seems to be healing well if more slowly than I'd like, however I've been left with quite a lot of pain in my sinuses which doesn't seem to be easing. The pain is mostly a pressure mostly within my nose, but which also can move across from my jaw above the extracted tooth, and up into the bridge of my nose and across my forehead towards my temples. At times it feels like I've been punched in the face! The neighbouring teeth are also pretty sensitive.\n\nthe dentist said there was no sinus communication during the extraction nor have I had any leakage of fluid between sinuses and mouth. The tooth was a 'beast' to remove (dentists words not mine) and took a lot of pulling to extract. I have also had to have a lot of work on my upper left jaw in the last few months (fillings, a wisdom tooth extraction and the failed RCT) so I suspect this may be contributing to the pain as my mouth is metaphorically saying it's had enough. \n\nIs this likely to just be due to trauma/bruising/inflammation to the surrounding tissues in my mouth/sinus floor after the extraction or something more serious? If just bruising, I guess it just needs time, but how long could I expect it to continue?\n\nthanks for any help anyone can give about this. Any advice greatly appreciated"

Back in late January i was eating some salty chips and it caused some inflammation on the side of my tongue.  it took several weeks to get better (and certain foods kept irritating it) but then it came back. when i looked at the side of my tongue i saw what appeared to be a small sore/hole and a white halo surrounding it.  I went to an oral surgeon and he said that the area was coming into contact with a sharp edge of my tooth and that i should get it smoothed out by my dentist.  He also said he could biopsy it for me which kinda scared me.  ANyway i wanted to see if anyone can offer some feedback on this. \n\nAlso just a brief history...my mother has erosive oral lichen planus and in the past i had two outbreaks of something similar to what i have now only it was on the inside of my cheek and on the inside of my lower lip.  both areas healed and dont bother me anymore but much like what i have now, there was a small sore that seemed to cause this white patch to form around it. i attached a current pic with an arrow pointing to the site of the sore \n\nThanks so much! James Michael David: This is a painful procedure but it will helps it heal quickly and effectively, rub a salt on top surface of the sore under your tongue and gargle with water, after then wait for 2-3days of healing."

That is perfectly fine but, at about 9 days after the extraction, it became very intense and getting worse.The pain literally kept me up all night. Now I am on day 10. i went and saw my dentist this morning and he checked it out and said everything looked perfectly fine, no dry socket. He gave me some antibiotics and Tylenol 3's saying it could be an infection on the bottom. Today is Still day 10 and im still in extreme pain. meds not helping at all. keep calling them and they keep saying to just take ibuprofen and call in the morning if it still hurts. i feel like I am not being taken seriously of the amount of pain I am in. It is a shooting pain from the base of my jaw all the way up to my head causing headaches and my ear to hurt. As ive said i have had 3 other extractions and not one of them has hurt like this. Is there anything else it could be? Anything i can do? \n\nside note : i was not given anything post extraction, not antibiotics or anything for pain which was also different from my other extractions.\n\nThank you in advance for any help ! Bill A: I had a similar problem with an extraction, intense persistent pain after a tooth had been removed. In my case it was because a fragment of the extracted tooth was still lodged in the gum and needed to be removed. spoon: Would the dentist not be able to tell if there was still a piece in there? did your dentist notice it right away or did you have to keep going back? Its now day 11 now and still in ongoing pain. haven't called the dentist yet in case it is just an infection and trying to give antibiotics time to work. Not proud of it, but i had to get some other pain medicine as the dentist keeps putting off giving me anything to help (not sure why he would). At this point im just ready for it just to be over. Bill A: I had to go back to have the tooth splinter removed. The dentist did not notice it right away. The pain was so severe that I thought that another tooth needed to be extracted, which was not the case.\nYou might wish to check out this informative presentation:\nhttp://www.animated-teeth.com/tooth_extractions/a-tooth-fragment-sequestra.htm spoon: your explanation fits almost exactly... i started checking out my other teeth earlier today to see if i need another one pulled. top and bottom beacuse i cant pinpoint where the pain is as its the whole side of my face. going back again first thing tomorrow James Michael David: Your dentist should do an x-ray to make sure that their are no fragments left in the gums that one thing causes the pain and 10 days is a hell of a pain."

    "dialogue": "Larry: Hi,\n\nThis situation is so tough on me it's even tough to type out.  I'll try and simplify.\n\nMy trouble started 20 years ago.  I developed hyper sensitivity allergies to things and became scared to do the things needed for my health.  Shortly after a bottom molar cracked in half.  I've literally lived with it for almost 20 years, never seeing the dentist and chewing on one side.  I almost had it worked on, but didn't.  Terrible decision.  \n\nAbout 2 years ago my top wisdom tooth on the other side broke in half.  I lived with that as it didn't cause much pain.  About 4 months ago while eating the majority of the wisdom tooth fell out.  I can feel just a tip of the outer part of the tooth in a few spots.  At first it was a bit hole and how I can feel skin in the middle of the hole (not sure if it's a swollen nerve or what.  It didn't hurt for the first month, but I've had some pain recently.   \n\nTo make things much worse, I have a heart valve issue and overall am not in great shape.  \n\nAt this point I've got myself into a position that I don't know how to get out of.  I always sort of thought I could have the tooth(s) extracted if needed, but with the wisdom tooth now below the gum I'm guessing it's now major surgery.  \nI'm in such bad mental shape it literally feels like I can either struggle along as is until a complication kills me or risk my life by dealing with the dentist/surgery.   \n\nOverall thoughts/worries:\n\nSo much wrong with my mouth, where would they start?\nFear I couldn't survive going completely under anesthesia instead of a local, but pretty sure they'll need to put me under for the wisdom tooth issue\nNo idea how they'll get my cracked wisdom tooth out\nCan't imagine dealing with my heart issue though surgery (if that's needed) before handling my teeth, BUT I can't imagine doing he reverse either\nSorry for the long post.  I know there's not an easy answer, but would appreciate some input.  \n\nAnd if nothing else this might be a great lesson for those putting stuff off.  If only I had gone years ago.\n\nOh boy... drmins: It appears to be that, you are very much frightened about your dental visits and this delay in consulting your dentist has resulted in things getting worse.\n\nYou dentist would examine you and make an over all assessment of your oral health.Based on the history given, you will probably need an extraction for your top wisdom tooth that is broken.It can usually be done under LA  (local anesthesia) and need not be much worried about it.\n\nHOWEVER, ENSURE TO TAKE THE NECESSARY ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS AND YOUR CARDIOLOGISTS CONSENT BEFORE UNDERGOING YOUR DENTAL SURGERIES."

    "title": "Wisdom Teeth Extraction did not go well - question now",
    "dialogue": "skcup: I had my wisdom teeth removed a few weeks before Xmas. I should make it clear that I am no longer seeing my dentist; the process was terrible.  She extracted them under a local and was distracted the whole time and stabbed me repeatedly while stitching up the sockets because she was having another conversation. She also left in the middle of the procedure to go see another patient, leaving me alone with my mouth jacked open and blood in my mouth. One of the lower teeth was a lot more complicated than she'd implied and  curved around my jaw.  I suspect she should have referred me to an oral surgeon for that one but didn't want to lose out on the $$$ doing it herself. Horrible experience and I'm not really a baby about this kind of stuff in general.\n\nWhen I left, she gave me really vague instructions about after care and sent me home.  I did my best but still developed dry socket and an infection a few days later in the lower (complicated) extraction site. I returned to the office and they grudgingly saw me (made me wait forever too) and she gave me a clove packing and an antibiotics prescription (nothing for pain) and told me to take the clove pack out in 9 days.  Well, it fell out in the 3 so I went back to get it repacked. Once again, they grudgingly saw me.  Went home, that night the pain got worse to the point where I couldn't sleep or think. I called the next day and asked for something for pain and she said she'd call a prescription in right away to my local pharmacy.  Went to the pharmacy and was upset because they seemed to have lost the prescription.  They looked for a few hours while I ran errands. When I went back, the told me she'd JUST called in the prescription then (almost four hours since she said she'd do it right away). \n\nAnyway, I know all of this detail is not relevant to the medical situation but the short version is: this woman is horrible, her office is horrible, they are disorganized, unprofessional and unconcerned with follow up.  \n\nIt's now been about a month and I've recently developed what feels like a swollen flap of skin at the complicated lower extraction site.  It seems to be getting bigger but I am having trouble telling.  I am worried that there is something in there from before the dry socket healed up and that it's abscessing.  Is that likely? Will it burst on its own if I wait? There's almost no pain except when I poke at it.  \n\nI really don't want to go back there but I'm not sure if any dentist will deal with me since she did the surgery and should be doing the follow up.  I'm in Canada and insured if that makes any difference.\n\nAny advice is appreciated. And for the record, I've documented everything that happened with the procedure and am sending a letter to her to explain why I'm leaving the practice. I haven't send it yet because I wanted to be 100% sure I was in the clear from complications before burning any bridges. DIG IT: Hey skcup,\n\nSomething similar happened to me at around the exact same time as it happened to you. I had an abscess form at the back of my throat after wisdom teeth removal, which blocked my airway within 4 days (had to have an immediate surgery).\nI hope that you have seen a medical professional about it, because sometimes rarities do happen. If it was infected, I hope you took some Antibiotics for it & that you're all good now.\n\nI know it's a bit late, but if you see this I'd like a reply to see how you went with it. skcup: thanks for the reply - in the end, it turned out to be bits of tooth fragment working loose. I got about 3 of them that came to the surface and it ended up being okay. I spoke to several other dentists at the time who advised me what risks to watch out for so I would have sought medical help if necessary DIG IT: Oh that's pretty lucky all the fragments surfaced without the need of surgery or anything. Glad you're all okay!"

During the surgery, I was told that there was an infection by one of the roots and that the doctor \"scraped it off\" completely off the bone. I was told that the entire procedure went perfect and according to plan.\nI diligently followed all post-op instructions. As soon as the next day, I noted stuff \"falling out\" of the treated area. They looked like tiny white/off-white stones. I called the office and informed the doctor but was told that it was normal.\n11/24/2014 - I had my 1 week post-op. I was told everything looked great. I complained about things falling out of the area but was told that it was only an insignificant fraction of what was put in. I complained that there was a lot falling out but was assured that I should not worry.\n12/16/2014 - I had my 1 month check up today and was told that the area did not heal as it should have and that it healed with a \"big indent\" and there was no specific reason for it. I asked if it was because I noted all those things falling out and the Dr. said no. He said that everything might have \"sunk in\" due to the infection that was there prior to the procedure. I was told to come back in 2 months after everything heals completely. He said he would do an x-ray and If the bone was not good for an implant, he would go in and re-do the graft.\n\nQuestions:\n1. What could cause a graft not to heal properly?\n2. Is it true that a pre-existing infection that he said he scraped-off could have caused the walls around the tooth to collapse?\n3. Is it a common procedure to re-do a graft after just 3 months of the initial grafting?\n\nI feel a bit uneasy about the situation and would appreciate your expertise and advise.\n\nThank you. Dentgr: grafting particles \"fall out\" when there is a gap. This gap allows micro organisms to enter the site and contaminate the grafting material.

This, considering its my front teeth is the highest priority. The other issue I have is regarding tooth #30. I had a root canal many yrs ago that \"failed\". I have 2 roots that seem to have an absess or infection below (wont know exactly until they go in there- theres no pain what so ever) and is very close to the jaw nerve (1 is large, the other isn't as big). My oral surgeon told me that in order for me to eventually have an implant I need to have a bone graft done at the time of extraction (note- apicoectomy is not an option since its too close to the jaw nerve). My question is would it be possible to have the extraction, clean out the socket and leave it as is for a year or 2 (after my front teeth are fixed) and then have the bone graft? Would the fact that I have bone loss already from the infection cause further damage and less chance for an implant later?

They are the teeth right before my two molars.\n\nThey have started becoming extremely sensitive and bothering me all the time. They have each been repaired multiple times, and regardless of my excellent oral hygiene I guess it's time for them to come out. They look fine and seem solid in there, but since they are bugging me he said its the best idea.\n\nHowever I have a problem. I have a disease called Wegener's Granulomatosis, so I don't have any insurance. I am extremely immune compromised (another reason he wants to take them out) I can afford to have the teeth removed, but the replacement options are crazily priced. I am sure it is worth it, but the price I was quoted on for implants was about $9000. I simply can't justify it. \n\nI know I will not wear a denture, so it's not even an option.\n\nWill there be any major concerns of just pulling them out and having a space? I am very upset to do that.. But I really don't see how there is any other option that will work for me.\n\nI am hoping someone can come on and tell me a magical solution... But I know that that's unlikely. Dr. Garrett Fiorenza: Pulling them and leaving a space has pros and cons. The pro is you get these teeth out that are starting to give you some fits. The con is you will have a gap in the position where the teeth used to be. This gap will allow the teeth behind these teeth to drift forward. \n\nIn my opinion, if you can't afford implants, get the teeth out and see how you do with having a gap. You will either not even notice the gap, or you will be annoyed by the space and look into saving up for the more expensive implants. Either way I think it is best to remove these teeth since they are becoming sensitive to you. Hope this helps,\n\nGarrett Fiorenza, DDS\nwww.fiorenzadentalgroup.com\nGreenwood, IN carriej: Thank you for the response!\n\nI guess I will just have them pulled. Funnily enough, they have been bearable so I am less likely to part with them until after the holidays.\n\nWill there be a soft spot there that will be jarred when eating hard food (nuts, crackers, etc), or will it be fine?\n\nMy dentist led me to believe that the implants must be placed on tooth removal, and that I would not be able to get them down the road if I decided to. \n\nI guess we will see what happens. Dr. Garrett Fiorenza: The area will be soft at first, but the gum will harden and you won't hurt it by eating. Without seeing xrays it's hard for me to comment, but you should be able to get implants down the road. As long as your bone looks fine now and you aren't waiting 30 years to get the implants.\n\nGarrett Fiorenza, DDS\nwww.fiorenzadentalgroup.com"

    "dialogue": "happygirl0612: Hello,\nI am so confused about what to do with my tooth. \nLast year in April 2013 i had a root canal done on tooth # 30. I waited a little over a year to get a crown. In august 2014 i did a crown and ever since have been having issues with that tooth. First it started with sensitivity to heat and then after the dentist performed a bite adjustment, i started having sensitivity to cold which still continues to date. \nI went back and saw Endodontist there who told me that x-ray shows a possible infection on the bottom of the root canal and the only 2 options that i have are apicoectomy or implant. \n\nI read a lot about it and dont think apicoectomy will be good for me in a long run. I dont want to leave a dead tooth inside that is prone to the infection. I am young (29) and dont want to come to the same issue years later. So at this point i am considering an implant. \nI read a lot about implants and currently there are 2 that are on the market, titanium and zirconium. \nI would prefer a zirconium (metal free) implant and based on what i have seen so far, it seems to be a safer more natural choice. \n\nIs that possible that infection developed AFTER the crown was placed? Why is that? The x-rays taken before the crown dont show anything. \nWhat do i do now? Dr. Garrett Fiorenza: As far as the root canal is concerned, it is hard to say by just looking at these 2 xrays what has been going on with this tooth in the long term. It is unlikely that the infection happened after the crown was placed. If you waited over a year to get the crown chances are the infection was there and you just didn't have any symptoms.\n\nI would get a consultation with an oral surgeon to talk about the costs involved in getting this tooth taken out and replaced with an implant. Then compare that with the cost of an apicoectomy. You will find that apicoectomies are expensive, but not as expensive as an implant. The thing to realize is even if you get the apicoectomy then 10 years from now you could still need an implant. On the other hand, if you get an implant (which have a 96% success rate) chances are you'll have it for the rest of your life.\n\nNow, titanium implants are the standard right now. They have the longest track record and are very successful. I would go with titanium.

I know the cost is high for both, but my main goal is to find the BEST solution for my overall health and i am willing to spend the money needed for whatever procedure. \n\nIs it true that apicoectomy does not guarantee that the root canal will stay infection free for all my life and that is just the matter of time until it gets infected?\n\nAlso, even though titanium implants have been longer on the market, i read many positive things about zirconium implants. Why are they NOT more used by dentists? Are there anything i should be concerned about when it comes to them? Dr. Garrett Fiorenza: Apicoectomies can last your whole life. However, since you've already gotten an infection in that tooth after the root canal it lowers the long term prognosis. So in your case I would be willing to bet that at some point down the line that tooth will get an infection or other complication after you do the apicoectomy.\n\nDentists use titanium more because of it's track record. These implants have been studied and have long term success rates of over 90%, even going out 20-30 years. With the zirconium implants dentists don't know for sure how they will last long term. Just personally, if I were looking for the best option for long term success I would go with titanium since it has that long term success rate that's been confirmed over and over again. Hope this help,\n\nGarrett Fiorenza, DDS\nwww.fiorenzadentalgroup.com\nGreenwood, IN happygirl0612: Thank you so much for your reply! \nI do understand that titanium has a proven record for lasting a long time. However, aren't dentists concerned with what impact it may have on the patient's overall health? What about titanium corroding in the mouth or affecting your immune system and creating autoimmune issues?\n Its not just the matter of being durable and lasting, it is also so important to consider other long term effect on health and such. I want to have a tooth that not only lasts but also doesn't harm my health! To me that is probably even more important. \nI have read so many scary things online when people complained how titanium implants have affected their health negatively! \n\nBesides the durability, lasting and lack of research , do you have any other major concerns for ceramic implants? \n\nAlso, is there any test that can be done to prove that i am not allergic to the titanium metal, etc? \n\nI am guessing outside of just implant & apicoectomy, i have no other viable options, correct?\nthank you!! Dr. Garrett Fiorenza: No there's no negative effect the zirconium would have besides for a lack of track record. Remember though that titanium is inert and is perfectly safe, that's why doctors use it on hip and knee replacements. But if that is a worry for you then zirconium is a viable alternative.\n\nI'm sure you could contact a specialist to see if you are allergic to titanium, although titanium allergies are incredibly rare.\n\nYou could also have a dental bridge placed. This is a slightly older technology for replacing teeth. They would put crowns on the teeth on either side of the missing tooth, and put a fake tooth (just the top part, no root) in the space. They are a good option for replacing a missing tooth, but implants are far better.\n\nGarrett Fiorenza, DDS\nwww.fiorenzadentalgroup.com happygirl0612: Thanks so much for the info! \n\nI definitely dont want a bridge since it may negatively affect other teeth in the long run since they get affected. So i guess the only viable option for  me is to have an implant. \n\nThe reason why i was concerned about getting a zirconia implant (outside of its short track record) was that i read they may have isotopes in them! That is really scary to me! Do you know anything about that? \n\nAlso, what can happen in the worst case scenario with zirconia implant, it breaks and it has to be replaced? Is that all that can happen? I read that they are just as durable if not more as titanium.\n\nthank you. Dr. Garrett Fiorenza: I'm not familiar with isotopes in zirconia implants. You're right the worst case is that it breaks and you have to get it removed and replaced. Dentgr: I believe there's a second distal root that is not treated.(i can see 2 lamina dura at the distal root).

In your case ,if there's a missed canal, it's very high(about 95%). He will though remove the crown and post buildup  to access the extra canal. In my opinion it's worth to give it a try. There's nothing like our own teeth!\nMolars like this usually have 3 canals. Under the microscope I've found up to 5!(in bibliography I've seen even 6 of them!)\nSo give it a chance.\nApicoectomy is a different procedure. Retreatment procedure is like the treatment you had in the first place.\n...apologies for my English but I'm not from an English speaking country...."

I'm not from an English speaking country, so I may not be able to use specilistic terminology while describing my case, but I think you can see everything in the pictures attached. \n\nI was directed to the facial surgery department to have my wisdom tooth removed. But after a quick glance at the x-ray which I'm also posting here, the doctor declared that she isn't going to remove my eighth tooth, although it's growing almost vertically, because the seventh tooth is rotten so badly, that it needs to be extracted first. She said that when the wisdom tooth fully gets out of the gum it will be able to compense for the lost seventh in its place. Do you think it's really possible? Can the croocked eighth tooth play any role in my mouth?\n\nMy situation isn't good, because my sixth tooth on the side is dead and it will soon fall apart if the whole work of chewing food is handed over to it \n\nWhat is your opinion? Do you really think there's no hope for my seventh tooth? And what if the surgeon only removed the part of the gum that still covers the seventh (making it impossible to bore in) and tried to treat the seventh tooth, leaving the eighth tooth still impacted. Do you think that can be a solution? Krzysiek: Is there really no advice for me? I forgot to mention I'm 20 years and I don't feel like losing all my molars on the right side yet Dentgr: I don't think there is a chance of wisdom tooth to move in the 7 position.\nI would suggest treating the 7 and 6 and maybe extract the 8.\nCheck the 5 as well.

Nicolas: Yes, there are full set of dental implants. There are All on four, all on six and all on 8 dental implants. The best dental implant would be all on six because it is safer and a restoration can be placed even if one of the implants fails. All on four dental implants can cause jaw line fracture and there failure risks are high. movemen: four or six implants is all depends on bones available, arch configuration (oval, wide, long) and quality of bone.

Did your Dentist note any decay on your wisdom teeth?  If you choose to keep your wisdom teeth for a while longer make sure you continue to get regular checkups. If you are unable to keep the area clean between your wisdom teeth and your adjacent 2nd molars, decay can occur which would jeopardize the 2nd molars.  You definitely don't want to lose those teeth. Dr.Michael A.Blum.: Wisdom teeth is not to remove when they are healthy,grown in completely , positioned correctly and able to clean daily. There are difference opinion of different dentist regarding wisdom teeth extraction. jhonypeter: Usually, wisdom teeth get taken out when they are pushing on any surrounding teeth or are not coming straight up. This may happen when one's mouth is too small and doesn't have enough room for the wisdom teeth. (I think this is called impaction). Nicolas: There is no need to remove wisdom tooth if they are healthy and positioned correctly. Sometimes dentists suggest for extraction of wisdom tooth of they are not fully grown or erupted near the lower jaw. Since you are younger, its removal may not cause you much pain after surgery.

It was a difficult extraction and the root had to be split, removed and no stitches were put into the gums. Within 3 days I started experiencing pain that hasn’t stopped since.  Sharp stabbing pain in the upper gum on the same side as the tooth extractions (I have no maxillary teeth) and sharp pain in the extraction site that feels like dry sockets. Due to the July 4th holiday, I went to the ER and they prescribed antibiotics, in which I am taking.  On Monday, July 7th I returned to the dentist and told him of the intense pain, in addition to asking about the jaw bone that is still exposed. He told me that things were healing, I don’t have dry sockets and to use ambisol on my gums for the pain.  Nothing is taking care of the pain! \n\nThrough much experience with extractions, I have never had this type of pain, but the dentist insisted this healing process is normal.\n\nSo I am hopeful to get some help here with understanding what is going on and these are my questions:\n\n1)  Will tissue eventually heal over the exposed lower jaw bone?\n\n2)  What is causing my maxillary gum tissue to have sharp intense pain?\n\n3)  How long should I wait to see if the gum heals or at what point should I return to the dentist since there is no more follow up?\n\nThank you in advance for your time and attention."

LADentalclinic: Dry sockets are caused when you lose the blood clot that forms after an extraction.  This is the first step in the healing process. A dry socket is exposed bone. Ways to prevent dry sockets are: For the first 36 hours after the extraction do not rinse and spit, smoke, drink through a straw, drink anything carbonated, or do any heavy lifting.  Sometimes even if these instructions are followed you can still get a dry socket, particularly if you had very difficult surgical extractions."

I've seen lots of different dentists and doctors but none have been able to solve the problem.\n\nI was recently referred to the Academy of Laser Dentistry by the dentist who performed the frenectomy/gum graft. He recommended that I look into doing laser therapy. I am currently searching for a dentist who is knowledgable in this area in San Diego. I've contacted some ALD certified dentists in the area but they don't do laser therapy for gum pain.\n\nIf you feel as though you may be able to help me or send me in the right direction for this unique problem please let me know and I would be extremely grateful.\n\n History and potential factors for my chronic mouth pain:\n\n• I'm a healthy 24 year old male residing in San Diego, CA.\n\n• On Dec. 28th, 2011 I had gum graft surgery & frenectomy to correct receding gum line in Colorado.\n\n• On June 8th, 2012 (about 6 months after the gum graft/frenectomy surgery) I put a small (capsule sized) amount of MDA (similar to MDMA) in my mouth at a concert which made direct contact with the graft area. The chemical temporarily gave my mouth an unpleasant chemical burning sensation but went away after about 30 minutes. This may or may not be related to the pain I experience.\n\n• I've seen many different professionals regarding this issue with no luck in finding a solution or any real direction on how to solve it:\n\n• Endodontist: Concluded there was nothing wrong with the roots of my teeth in that area by conducting a cold test\n\n• Periodontist: Several Periodontists have looked at the area and said it looks normal and are not sure what the issue is\n\n• Neurologist: I saw Neurologists at UCSD who were not sure what the issue is or how to solve it\n\n\nSymptoms detailed description:\n\nI experience frequent mouth pain where his frenectomy was (lower front gums). The pain and discomfort feels like some type of nerve damage and is always changing, and can be intense, throbbing, tingling pain for more than 24 hours, or I can be free of most symptoms for up to 24 hours at a time. Most of the time, there is a dull, aching discomfort. It feels like a pinching sensation on the inside of the lower front gums where the frenectomy was, and sometimes feels numbingly painful, similar to being very cold without the temperature sensation. The area is sensitive to cold and hot water, and seems to go away during and immediately following chewing on food. Over the past 2.5 years the overall sensation has not increased or decreased in intensity outside of its consistent pain spectrum (although it fluctuates in intensity on a daily basis within the pain spectrum).\n\nHere's an image outlining where I feel the pain/discomfort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, if you feel as though you may be able to help me or send me in the right direction for this unique problem please let me know and I would be extremely grateful."

It doesn't really affect me much and I never seriously considered having surgery on it, but with my last visit to the dentist I was warned that my frenulum may be starting to pull my gums down, risking exposure of the roots of my bottom teeth and other issues. I looked into getting a frenectomy and soon learned my insurance would not cover it as it is considered cosmetic, and as a graduate student I cannot afford to pay out-of-pocket. My dentist back in Michigan said he would be willing to perform it on me and write it up as a filling...but I have some reservations. I've been going to this dentist all my life but he's admitted to me he has only done this procedure once and never on an adult. Also he would be doing it with a scalpel and not a laser. Does anyone have any advice on if I should go ahead with it or perhaps suck it up and find a more qualified oral surgeon to handle it? I've read a couple horror stories where a simple frenectomy has caused permanent pain in the tongue/gums and also cases where the healing process goes awry and the frenulum comes back more restrictive than before. Any/all feedback would be greatly appreciated. LADentalclinic: This is a very simple procedure that takes 10 minutes or less, but i'm not sure that i'd want someone operating on me who has only done it once.  You may want to wait until you can afford a more qualified dentist or oral surgeon.  You may be able to appeal the insurance companies decision as well.  This may require a letter from your surgeon.  An electrosurgery unit is good for this procedure.  It cuts and cauterizes the area at the same time which results in minimal to no bleeding. Rohkey: Thank you. As my dental insurance is only in Michigan (I live in Atlanta now) and I'm only in MI for two-three weeks out of the year, I'm going to ask my dentist if he thinks I can wait a year to have the surgery. If so, I'll see what I can do about the insurance and finding a more qualified physician. LADentalclinic: Waiting another year won't make a difference.  Just remember that the actual procedure wont be as bad as it seems, so you don't have to be overly nervous.  Best of luck to you."

On one side of the gap is a bad wisdom tooth and on other side is a tooth with a crown.  Can 2 implants support a Bridge?  Can mini implants be used on upper jaw? LADentalclinic: Can two implants support a bridge? Yes, but whether implants are an option for you will depend on several factors, including the amount and quality of bone in the area.  To really learn your options you will need to schedule an appointment for a consultation with a Dentist who does implants.  Oral Surgeons and Periodontists specialize in implant placement."

But I've also heard some great stories of dental treatments in Mexico. Can anyone share they're experiences? Jennifer Shaw: Hello Naomi, there are a lot of good dentist in Mexico that can give you great quality dental implants for a cost-effective price. Border cities are targets for dentists who are looking for different kind of customers, most of them Americans.\n\nI had extensive dental work done in Los Algodones with a help of a medical tourism called PlacidWay.  I had 5 teeth extracted and 3 implants that included bone grafting. I was able to saved money and was really happy with my implants, which is 3 years old right now and still looking great. If you are concerned with the qualifications of the dentist, or having troubled finding one, then a dental tourism provider must be a smart choice, specially for first timers.  If you want to have  a list of trusted dental clinics and dentist in Mexico, you  can contact the provider that I used: info@placidway. com. Good luck to you!"

    "dialogue": "Joshua: On April 3 I had my two wisdom teeth pulled out on my right side. The top extraction has no complications and is in the appropriate healing stage. As for the bottom tooth, this on was slanted in my mouth and was sawed out. The tooth came out in pieces. \nWhen I got home I looked at the extraction site and noticed a white pointy object below the bottom wisdom tooth's pervious location. I assumed it was just a stitch at first. \n  The next day I looked at it again because I was feeling some sharp rubbing my tongue. I inspected the pointy piece and assumed It was a piece of the tooth that was left behind. I finally got to get back to the dentist today and he told me that it was bone that had fractured and poked through the gum. The doc cut the bone and now I'm feeling relief from the pointy object but I'm wandering how will the second hole on the side of my gum about as big as a pencil eraser is going to heal. There is a stitch over the bone but the bone is slanted and a blood clot is on the side of my gum. Will the heal back to normal? LADentalclinic: The human body is an amazing thing.  It is not unusual to have bone chips after an extraction, but most people heal with no complications.  Having a suture over the extraction will help.  If you do notice anything that seems unusual you can schedule a follow up appointment."

    "dialogue": "MrBear5587: Hey guys and gals,\n\nJust wanted some thoughts really on my lower left wisdom tooth, which is due for extraction on Friday.\nTo cut a long story short, I'm 26 - hadn't been to the dentist for about 12 years to him retiring, and my own stupidity in not getting a new dentist. Had known I needed to go and get my teeth sorted for around 8 years.. yet I procrastinated.\nDidn't finally go until September last year for my initial appointment/checkup. Needed 2 extractions and 7 fillings. (Prior to this, had only 1 filling from many years ago). Over the last few months, I've been a couple of times and had everything done except the final extraction (lower left wisdom tooth). I've been putting it off because I'm terrified.\n\nI can't put it off any longer, the appointment is the coming Friday...\n\nPictures aren't majorly clear, but the inner side of the tooth, which can't really be seen is actually slightly below the gum-line. I'm slightly worried that the dentist won't be able to grip the tooth. I had a lower molar pulled about 3 months ago (not a wisdom tooth), took around 6 weeks to heal, I'm guessing this will take longer - will I need stitches?\n\nDoes this look like it will be a trouble-free extraction? Plan is for it do be done only under Local Anesthetic.\n\nCouple of pictures below. Thoughts would be appreciated.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nThank you. MrBear5587: Well didn't go to plan, although the Dentist is excellent my tooth isn't numbing or budging very far..\n\nDentist couldn't remove the tooth. Had absolutely loads (at least 12 shots) of anaesthetic, tooth wouldn't numb. Shooting pain throughout my jaw as soon as she started to rock it side to side.\nTried for a good 30 minutes. Practically no movement in the back roots apparantely and the tooth is infected.\n\nI've got to see an Oral Surgeon, in March unless I go to hospital (which I'm not), to have it removed.\nApparently they will cut down the side of the gum around the tooth and possibly end up removing some bone.. sounds fun.\n\nI've been given some antibiotics to clear up the infection.. Metronidazole 200mg & Amoxicillin 250mg (5 day course). Not entirely clear whether I take them now, or wait until March, so I've just finished the course before I see the Surgeon. Will probably speak to the dentist later to clarify.\n\nAlso, now because my tooth is loose, it feels higher when I close my mouth (so it now actually touches the top tooth). Whilst I'm still numb, I'm hoping that it will settle down, as any pressure on the tooth causes immense pain else I won't be able to bite.\nNumbness wore off about 1:30PM, first shots were around 11AM. Can't close my mouth properly and jaw is pretty sore, but it's manageable.\nAbove all, I'm just really annoyed with myself. I've not been able to use this Wisdom tooth for atleast the last 10 years. Why didn't' I get it sorted?\nThe other lower wisdom tooth ended up having a very large filling - no problem, I can use it now. If I'd have gone sooner, that would have been a small filling, then the left one that was attempted to be removed today could have been saved.\n\nI knew I needed to go, but kept putting it off.\nHindsight is a wonderful thing, eh?!"

Like, could it be just past the gum line? I went to the dentist's for an exam the other day, and I asked her to check the extraction sites, which she said looked fine, so I neglected to ask her about the fistula possibility. Anyway, I dunno if anyone has any experience with fistulas, or if they'd be able to help me, but I'd love it if you could. \n\nPlease, I need help; don't ignore me if you can help it. danielhermann: Hi,wafflesown \noromaxillary fistula may develop as a complication of removing a tooth, or from infection or trauma.Sometimes the roots of a tooth are so close to the bone under a maxillary sinus that the bone is damaged when the tooth is removed. This can open a passage between the mouth and sinus.Before surgery, you may have an imaging test, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan  to help the doctor plan your surgery.A surgeon may choose one of several techniques to close the fistula.Sometimes a surgeon will place a piece of medical-grade foil over the opening and then stitch the skin flap over the foil.You probably will have general anesthesia, which means you will be unconscious during the operation.doctor will prescribe antibiotics to prevent infection and a decongestant to keep the sinuses clear. You probably will take these medicines for a week to 10 days.given a list of precautions to follow to avoid smoke, blow your nose, or suck on items such as straws, hard candy, or ice. A fistula can cause chronic inflammation or infection of the sinus.In some cases, a very small fistula may be treated without surgery. A dentist or oral surgeon may apply gauze or another product over a blood clot that forms in the hole left by the extracted tooth. The gauze stays in place for a few days to help the wound heal."

It's his two front lower teeth, at birth they were not fully emerged from the gum.   They were loose under his gums and I was informed they may need to be pulled as they can be a choking hazard.  They had not erupted when we left the hospital nor at his check up, so the pedi decided we did not need a referral to a pediatric dentist. They have since erupted and are still semi loose but not so loose that I worry about them coming out just yet. \n\nI have found very little info on natal teeth and my pedi doesn't  have a whole lot to say about it.  I want to avoid having them pulled if we can, and so far they don't seem to hinder his ability to nurse ( not entirely pleasant for me though).   \n\nI'm  wondering if I should just go ahead and try and find a dentist who will see him. I just want some info  I turned to dr google (not a fan of using google in place of real medical/dental advice) and cannot find anything useful.   Would x rays show how well the root is developed  and give an idea if they need to come out?  Also can they become more sturdy in the mouth as he gets older?    He doesn't seem in any pain and eats very well. \n\nI had no dental care as a child and now suffer because of it I don't want my children to have my oral problems I'm just not sure what to do not do I want to subject my 2 week old to having teeth extracted if its not truly needed. MartyD: You should take him to see a Pediatric Dentist. They are well trained to deal with natal teeth and by starting the baby in his new dental home you can avoid all the problems you had as a child. The pediatric dentist will take an occlusal to determine the root length.The Xray and the mobility will determine if the tooth needs to be extracted. It is possible that the there is enough root development to allow the teeth to become more anchored. No extraction should be performed on a child less than 10 days due to Vit K issues but since your child is older you should be safe. Also there is a risk of residual tooth formation and a need for a second procedure. At any rate, I would not avoid going to the dentist. At this stage the baby has no memory and the procedure will be more difficult for you than for him! marrkarnell: The pediatric dentist might do some xray before he performs such extractions. It's quite a hard job, i guess, because the gums of your baby is still soft that the dentist might be careful in performing."

Though she said this would be cheaper, until I could get the wisdom teeth pulled up to fill that gap, I would have a large gap in the back that would affect my chewing.\n\nAlthough #1 is the more expensive choice, I am hoping that maybe they can just fill it or at least try to before doing a root canal.  I really don't know what to do. I don't like #2 because I know that pulling the wisdom teeth forward will be a long process, and I don't know how well they would be able to get the wisdom teeth lined up with the other teeth if I were to choose option #2.\n\nI know it's hard to give advice without seeing the actual x-rays, but I am really not sure what to do, and I don't have the money to get 2nd and 3rd opinions. I want to try to do the most affordable option, but I don't want to not be able to chew my food properly because of pulling the teeth that I need to eat with. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Since then, I have experienced phases of extreme pain that last for about an hour and can only be relieved with ibuprofen and pain medicine.  The pain is intense and includes the entire left side of my face.  When the pain dies down, my jaw and ear are sore to touch. It could be weeks before I have another episode.  I have an appointment this week to see the same dentist, but I am considering seeing a new dentist.

When looking in the mirror while I clench my teeth, I can not see any place where the implant tooth is touching my top teeth. I do not believe I am guilty of clenching during the day but I do notice that throughout the day, I have a lot of tension in my jaw. The cherry on top is that I switched jobs about 5 months ago and today looked at my dental insurance only to find that no procedures related to my implant are covered. I'm freaking out.

These teeth are impacted and partially erupted: the one in the lower left of the jaw is impacted horizontally, and the one in the lower right of the jaw is impacted at an angle pointing forward (mesial impaction). The prospect of having to undergo surgery to remove the wisdom teeth has been causing quite a bit of distress in me because it seems that the recovery post-surgery is rather long and troublesome. \n\nOne of my main concerns is that I’ll end up with large open holes that fail to heal and refill with gum tissue, and I’m also worried that the gums on the teeth near the extraction sites will suffer irreparable damage from the surgical procedure (for example, the gums on the second molars next to the extraction sites may become detached or recede). And to add to the possible complications, I’m 33 years old, which is a little old and makes recovery from surgical extraction of wisdom teeth more difficult. Are my concerns warranted?\n\nAdvice and answers to my concerns would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

Without them this bone will degenerate potentially giving your face a sunken appearance. You could consider implants also although these are more expensive."

However, I feel I haven't acquired enough skills to perform well my first dental implant surgery by myself. I'm really interested in keeping up with the day to day techniques regarding dental implant procedures. So, I would like to find an online educational program where I can improve my knowledge and skills to perform any dental surgery. I would appreciate a lot if you could tell me where I can find it. Caroline: There is an online continuing education program called DDS Mentoring which I have been using some time ago. It is owned by Dr. Gary O'brien, a well-known dentist in Glendale, CA with many years of dental implant expertise. In fact, he is the Director of Advanced Implant Training World Wide Implant Direct LLC. So, he is training doctors in Advanced Implant Surgery and Prosthetics. In DDS Mentoring, he gives lectures and advices to all the dentists who are members of the site with subjects like dental implants and others. Dr. O'brien discusses the dental implant cases that we give him and he will guide us on how to solve them. Also, many dentists members have the chance to discuss and share information in forums regarding implants and other dental issues. I really enjoy this wonderful opportunity because it is very helpful.\n\nI truly suggest you to join the DDS Mentoring. It provides you easy information to learn and a clear guide to place a dental implant. You will learn a lot and you will gain more confidence when you're doing a dental implant surgery.\n\nHere is the website: ddsmentoring.com dentimplants: Would you not be better to learn from working with a dental implant specialist?"

Can someone tell me and appropriate way to relay my uneasiness to the dentist. westiegal: They'll be only too happy to prescribe strong painkillers in my experience. I'm studying dentistry and they want you to be as comfortable as possible - Vicodin all the way! AlDental: Listen...Just got mine out friday, and it was cake.  I was just like you and very squeamish when it comes to stuff like that.  But, I was put under and don't remember a thing.  But I can tell you what they're going to give you will numb your jaw more then you can believe.  Stinks you can't wait for the anesthetic, but ya gotta do what ya gotta do.\n\nHere's how it went for me.  Came home from surgery, ate something those pain pills pumping.  One thing that I recommend is having something ready to eat as soon as you leave the dentist.  Have some jello or something waiting in the car, because as I was eating all the numbness was going away.  And it was very painful, and I'd skip it if I could.  Not cool at all...But, it was only for about an hour and then hydrocodone finally took effect.  Kept popping them as advised throughout the whole day and it kept me pretty pain free.\n\nNow the next day was kinda ehhh.  I woke up w/ no pain but some swelling occurred over night.  I actually didn't have to take the vic's since the day of, I've been in good shape pain wise.  But I did develop some sort of throat infection.  Very mild, just scratchy throat, and a cough.  But I heard this is normal and can occur because, some of the bacteria that the tooth had within gets expelled into the mouth, and can get you sick.  So I kinda had that head cold feeling all day which wasn't all that fun, but I'll take that over pain any day.  Today, I've been doing my thing like normal.  Still kinda tough to eat really fast, and kinda tender, but no pain what so ever.  If you've been suffering from tooth pain already you'll get through it just fine.\nSeriously, don't sweat it.\n\nThings to remember:\n-Have something to eat and drink as soon as you get out of the surgeons!  The pain WILL come and it WILL hurt, so if you can avoid it do so.  The faster you get the pain pill in you the better.\n-Be super careful if you smoke.  I've been smoking very lightly, and not sucking on the cig hard at all.  Make sure to leave a crack in your lips so you suck in air as you take the smoke in.  That way you're not creating any kind of built up pressure in your mouth.  The smoke doesn't cause dry socket, but the sucking does.  Smoking will delay healing, but I've been fine doing what I'm doing.  Also, straws are fine too.  Just don't suck on them like you normally would.  Be very gentle, and you'll be good.\n-Take it easy your first and second day because those to me were the uncomfortable ones.  But seriously nothing to be scared of!!\n-GUM!!! The taste of healing is not a good one...Got me some double mint and fixed that.  Gross taste.\n\nGood luck with your extractions!! AlDental: Wow...I just realized how old that post was..."

Is this hospital neglect? hankypanky: hi , if i was u i would try being referred again, but i would choose the hospital rather than ur gp or whoever choose for u. u are allowed to choose where u want to be treated , its ur right, dont let anyone tell u different, ur gp may say that they cant refer u, but thats not true, they say that to save costs, anyways i would go to different hospital, u should look at nhs choice website.. crankit: If there was some kind of authority I'd be reporting. I seem to hear alot of stories like this these days."

    "dialogue": "Trudijane: Hi,\n\nA few months ago, one of my upper back gums swelled up and was accompanied by some pain.  I decided to go directly to my periodontist first since it related to my gums. I guess he injected an antibiotic and the swelling/pain just went away.  I have had no problems with that particular area for a few months.\n\nHe took a lot of X-rays and shared them with my dentist in order to consult with him as to what I should do.  My dentist told me that there has been bone loss above that tooth he felt that root canal would be a waste of money and suggested I have that tooth extracted and then decide if I want an implant or not - later.\n\nI'm very much in conflict in making that appointment to extract this tooth because it has felt normal for the past 2 months.  My dentist assured me the infection would come back and I should have it extracted so it doesn't affect the adjacent teeth.  I keep putting it off because that tooth feels fine and if I did get it extracted, I would opt for an implant which is very expensive.\n\nWhat shall I do?  Can I wait awhile?  \nThanks,\nTrudijane gels: I would bring copies of your radiographs and get a second opinion from another Dentist.  It's never good to wait when making these kind of decisions because it could get worse even though it feels fine at the moment. crankit: I agree with the last reply. A second opinion sounds wise."

    "dialogue": "Tewan: Yesterday around 11:30am CST I went in to get the top back right tooth pulled. Come 2:00pm or so I was leaving the office heading home. Since then I've slept probably 14 hours at least and have had only three pudding cups and about a bottle of water to drink during this time. While sleeping, I kept my head propped up on three/four pillows laying on my back with an ice pack on the side of my face (right) that the extraction was on. I've been taking the antibiotics and hydrocodone that were prescribed along with 12 hour sudafed to prevent any sinus issues.\n\nI've also been keeping two gauze pads folded into a 1cm x 2cm x 2cm area in the extraction area as to soak up any bleeding and prevent me from sucking when my mouth is closed. I've tried keeping this out but as soon as I take it out my sub-conscious takes over and starts trying to suck in air through my closed mouth. The gauze is changed rather regularly (First due to bleeding, but now to keep it clean and drier as most bleeding has stopped).\n\nWhen I remove the gauze pad and do the short sucking (because once I notice myself doing it I immediately stop) it feels that there's air coming through the extraction site. Is this normal?\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned food / drinks, I just had two more pudding cups as well as a half-bottle of water to take another dose of medicine. Eating and drinking this round was quite a bit easier.\n\nThe main concern I have though is if the extraction site is healing well so I took a picture at the 16 hour mark with my cameraphone in hopes to someone here may be able to help out.\n\nUnfortunately I am unable to post images or links until I get 5 posts, so hopefully the moderators don't mind if I go around this rule... \n\nhttp://tewan.info/images/.hidden/extraction.jpg"

I understand C needs to be pulled and an implant put in.  My concern is that he wants to pull H (which might actually be 11) because he is not sure if it is a big tooth or little tooth and wants to add an implant.  I am hestitant to extract this tooth.  He says that I am not thinking of her overall looks, but I am just not that comfortable pulling a good tooth because he is not clear if it's a big tooth or baby tooth.  He says if does fall in 10 years she will have to get braces all over again - that seems crazy to me.  \n\nI was born with missing teeth as well and had two bridges and then on one side I did get implants a year an a half ago.  They will have to come out because I got an infection and it's not taking.  I have spent $100,000's on my teeth and they have been a nightmare.  I just want to make sure that I am doing the best thing for her.  She does grind her teeth, the implants would be going where there is missing teeth, our family has a history of autoimmune disease (i have never had her checked) so the implants are not a sure thing as everyone keeps telling me.  \n\nI am not against what he is recommending I just would like some thought as to pulling a perfectly good tooth and doing an implant.  \nI really appreciate you looking at this."

You will just feel a prick during local anesthetic shock.For pain after tooth extraction, pain meds are given by the dentist. sqwerl: Laughing gas or nitrous oxide also helps if it's available but it may cost you extra money even if you have an insurance plan. sunny: princess4ever said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHi, \n I'm going to have 2 teeth removed next week.

She was trying to extract that small bit of drill (this is invisible in the attached pictures as it's in the root canal somewhere). \nIn trying to extract that tip of drill, a second drill broke off and was somehow inserted deeper into the gum. This piece is titanium nickel and is 6mm long. That's the one that is visible.\n\nToday the endodontist did a gum surgery to try to remove that piece but she did not reach it, as it's farther up than she can safely extract or risk looking for.\n\nSo now she has referred me to an oral surgeon, whom I have an appointment with end of August His initial assessment (after looking at the x-rays) was to let the tissue around the drill piece heal (4 weeks), and get more firm before attempting anything. He will also run a CBCT scan to pinpoint the exact location. I inquired about the risk of having such a piece around or in the sinus, but he indicated that the bit is in the soft tissue, and does not pose a risk. \n\nI am still very worried though, as my endodontist seems so insecure and there is such a long time to wait for the oral surgeon.  \nI would value your opinion on these x-rays, what are the risks, what do you see, is the drill in the sinus and should I push for an immediate consultation? I am desperate. \nThank you."

Well gradually I got pain and it became Abscessed..anyway I went to the closest place that accepted my insurance and it was a dentures place that did extractions but since I put on the form that I had tachycardia the dentist or whatever he was would not pull the tooth. So I was sent to a oral surgeon and he wanted to put me under for one tooth?? Anyway he gave me antibiotics for 10 days and I was suppose to go back and have it pulled but my insurance would not approve being put to sleep for this. So I didn't go back and I just let it go. Well it had pain on and off sometimes, but not until this year about 2 weeks ago it got abscessed again, or im not even sure if the infection was just there for all this time. I went to the ER and they didn't do a x-ray or anything they just gave me pain meds and a antibiotic for penicillin 4x a day for 10 days. About 5 days later I went and seen a dentist and he took a x-ray of the tooth and said it STILL had alot of infection in it and gave me, I hope I spell it right, Clindomycin to combine with the penicillinm, I also told him it was very sore in my nasal and i was having sinus problems and he said it was infection. So I took it as prescribed and then about 3 days later I went and had the extraction. I felt it, even though he gave me shots...I just had that done on this past tuesday..Well he told me that 2 days after the procedure I could stop the antibiotic, and I did. Well I am having alot of sinus problems now, I feel stuffed up, and I also feel like theres ALOT of pressure in the gum where he took the tooth out. So could there still be infection??? I just don't understand I was on 2 antibiotics and the first one I was taking a week and the infection was still there. What should I do at this point? Go back to the dentist, or is this common after extractions? I heard of sinus holes but im confused because most say in the back top molars you get those. Please just offer information..\nThanks"
