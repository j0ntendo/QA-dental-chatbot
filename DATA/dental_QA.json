    "dialogue": "ReaC: Hello!\n\nI need a bit of advice regarding an injury I recently sustained. After a fall on cobblestones (which resulted in stitches on my chin), I noticed that one of my lower front teeth (an incisor) has slightly (about 1 mm) shifted forward compared to the others (without any bleeding). On a daily basis, the tooth doesn’t hurt, doesn’t bleed, doesn’t move significantly (it is not \"loose\" - when I press it with my tongue, it stays still), and the gum is not swollen. However, with certain jaw movements (e.g., moving the jaw forward, opening my jaw really wide, or pronouncing the letters \"u\", \"s\", \"z\"), I feel a strange \"clicking\" or \"grinding\" sensation around the gum area. Additionally, the tooth is still quite sensitive - when I tap on it, I feel discomfort. The same happens when I eat, and the tooth is pressed by other teeth - sometimes I feel that strange \"clicking,\" and sometimes just discomfort (as if the tooth might fall out or break under significant pressure). I’m going to the dentist this Wednesday for an X-ray, but since I’m a bit anxious - do you think there’s something to be really worried about?\n\nThank you in advance!"

    "dialogue": "Spock117: Hi. I had tooth pain come on while eating popcorn almost two weeks ago, in the first molar on the bottom left. After a week I got in to see a dentist. The pain is coming from a tooth with a crown and previous root canal (I think it was four years ago). He didn't see any signs of issues with the root canal or any issues that jumped out at him. He thought I had a sprained tooth ligament. He said he could do a bite adjustment if I wanted.\n\nFor the first week I wasn't doing anything different other than just chewing on the other side of my mouth. Since then I've been taking a couple ibuprofen a few times a day, doing ice, salt water, and not eating anything that requires much chewing at all.\n\nWorried that the bite adjustment might aggravate things more but also I'm desperate to get rid of this pain so might try it.  The pain is bad today and wrapping around to the top on the left, and I've also had pain on the right side (maybe from all the chewing on the right side?).\n\nI'm just hoping for any ideas on what else I should be doing or not doing to help this heal. Thanks. dentalexplorer123: Gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water several times daily to alleviate inflammation and support the healing process. If you have aloe vera juice at home, apply it directly to the affected area using a cotton swab and leave it on for 15-20 minutes before rinsing. In case of severe pain or persistent discomfort, consider using an over-the-counter product like Orabase or Orajel. Alternatively, GUM SensiVital toothpaste is available at your local chemist or Amazon, and can be applied twice daily for 7 days using a cotton swab directly to the affected area. Schedule an appointment with a qualified dentist who can provide a fresh perspective on your case.

Did you mean you think my dentists suggestion wasn't the right thing to do, or just that a second opinion would be good? Dr M: I would not say his suggestion was wrong. I would go for the adjustment on the crown. This should not worsen the problem, but relieving pressure on that specific tooth, might help the ligaments to heal more quickly.\nIf the pain persists after this, I would also suggest trying a course of antibiotics. Although the antibiotics is never a solution by itself, it should help to take the pain away and if the pain returns, I would investigate the root canal further.\nAlso rule out any other teeth in the area with possible problems. Could be that you have referred pain from another tooth. Spock117: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI would not say his suggestion was wrong. I would go for the adjustment on the crown.

I made an appointment with my primary care provider before I saw this, I was struggling with the pain and since the dentist hadn't prescribed anything and over the counter stuff wasn't helping I was hoping to talk about that with them and their office is right by where I live, much closer than the dentist.\n\nI asked if prescription pain meds or antibiotics might help at all and she initially didn't think so but then was looking in my mouth more and evidently saw something around the area that she thought justified the antibiotics. I asked about the bite adjustment and she thought it would good to go ahead and do the antibiotics first and not do the adjustment while there was still pain, with the disclaimer that she isn't the dentist and I'd have to ask a dentist about dental procedures.\n\nI picked up the antibiotics after the appointment. That's kind of the opposite order of your suggestion, does that seem okay if I start the antibiotic today and run it's course before doing the adjustment? Or not? Also would a bite guard be a good idea?\n\nMaybe it wasn't the right thing to go ask my doctor about this, I just got stressed and panicky about the pain.\n\nAlso I stupidly pushed down on the tooth with my finger during the appointment today. I hope I didn't make anything worse.\n\nThank you for your time and thoughts I really appreciate it. dentalexplorer123: A root canaled tooth with a crown can feel excruciating pain due to various reasons. One common cause is that the tooth may be infected or re-infected, which can lead to inflammation of the pulp tissue and nerve . Additionally, improper placement or fit of the dental crown, or bite misalignment, can exert pressure on the nerve and roots of the tooth causing pain. Inadequate sealing of old fillings, gum recession, or exposed tooth roots can also contribute to sensitivity and pain in a crowned root canal treated tooth . Furthermore, while crowns themselves are supposed to protect the tooth, the underlying tooth remains susceptible to infections which can cause increased pain and sensitivity.\n\nIf the pain is caused by an infection, you'll need to see your dentist for further treatment. They may prescribe antibiotics or perform additional procedures like retreatment of the canal or even extraction. A poorly fitting crown can be adjusted or replaced to ensure a proper seal and reduce irritation on the surrounding tissues if that is the case. Another probable case, is that the pain is due to bite misalignment, so your dentist may recommend adjusting your occlusion (bite) to alleviate pressure on the affected tooth. Desensitising agents or special toothpastes can be applied to reduce sensitivity caused by exposed root surfaces.  Additionally, gum tissue grafting may be considered if there's significant recession. In case inadequate sealing of old fillings is the issue, your dentist might replace them with new fillings or crowns that fit properly and seal effectively. Treating any underlying gum disease can help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain. Spock117: It's hurting worse than ever, I should be asleep right now, I tried but I couldn't relax with the pain. I'm sure I must have made things worse today or aggravated things or something. I didn't start the antibiotics like my doctor said tonight, I was worried about if I needed to see the dentist again what would he say about me going to my doctor. Dr M: Start the antibiotics. It takes about 2 days to kick in. If the pain disappears,wait until it returns before going for the adjustment on the crown. While you are on antibiotics, it will mask any symptoms, so it won't help going to adjust the crown. desrosiersdental: It sounds like you might have a piece of popcorn kernel stuck between your teeth or gums. At Admire Dental Care, we recommend visiting a dentist as soon as possible to prevent any potential infection or further complications. Prompt professional care can help alleviate the pain and address the root cause effectively.

Dr M: Not always no. Spock117: Okay thanks that's good to know. I assume he would have checked for that but I guess I don't know for sure.\n\nToday is day 4 taking the antibiotic, no change in symptoms so far and the pain definitely has been worse since the other day when I pushed on it, so stupid of me. It's a real pressing pain.  Thinking maybe I should try to get it checked out by another dentist soon, not sure how long to give it first though. Spock117: Pain (and probably stress over all this) is keeping me from sleeping again tonight. (Taken antibiotic for 5 days now and it is a 10 day course). I took Tylenol and had recently iced it before bed but that doesn't seem to have been enough.\n\nI'm thinking that the tooth pain and weird things it's causing me to do with my jaw and the anxiety of everything is causing me to develop TMJ alongside whatever the original issue is.  Jaw is really sore, and I have pain all around my mouth (though I guess that part could be referred pain). Spock117: I'm worried that I've been using an ice pack too much and could have caused damage. The inside of mouth feels weird maybe swollen (or maybe dry mouth?) and it feels odd when I tap my teeth together. Maybe that's all just due to the things I have going on, or the lack of sleep talking, I don't know."

It doesn’t hurt unless I put my finger on it, and it just bled a tiny bit. I noticed it on Saturday, and it hasn’t grown. I feel like it’s probably not significant enough to go to the dentist, but I wanted to ask to be sure. Also, this is the implant that I had placed a couple of years ago, and my health anxiety makes me nervous about things. The dot is not raised and is not filled with pus or throbbing.  Thanks so much! dentalexplorer123: Based on your description, it's possible that the pinkish dot at your gum line could be a small cut or irritation. The fact that it hasn't grown larger and doesn't hurt unless you touch it suggests that it might not be a serious issue. However, since this is an implant site, it's essential to have it checked by a qualified dentist clinically, to rule out any potential complications or infections! Your dentist can assess the area, clean it if necessary, and provide guidance on how to manage it appropriately. Given your health anxiety, it's understandable that you want to ensure everything is okay. I recommend scheduling an appointment with a qualified dentist to get a professional opinion on this matter.

I had a dentist appointment about a month ago, and they said my gums looked healthy and everything seemed fine. Since the appointment, I feel my gums have receded slightly in my bottom front teeth. I know this isn't likely to be periodontal disease, as I have a good home care routine and my gums do not bleed when I floss in the slightest. Though I have grinded my teeth in the past, I was given a night guard six months ago to hopefully prevent any future damage. As such, I'm confused why I'm getting recession. I know my gums are thin in this area as well, which scares me quite a bit. I have a few questions.\n\n1) Does my recession look particularly bad? I don't experience any pain and no roots are showing, but I can definitely see that the lengths of the front teeth are uneven here.\n\n2) What could be causing this? It can't be periodontitis or tooth grinding, and I don't believe I'm brushing too hard either. I use an electric toothbrush with a pressure sensor, and the sensor never activates when I brush. Could it be the fact that my teeth are somewhat crooked? I've also heard that the frenulum can have something to do with this as well.\n\n3) Are there any options to potentially remedy the thinness of my gums? I know gum grafts exist, but I'm not sure if that's something feasible."

    "dialogue": "Emmma: Hi , today I have had a temporary filling after 3 weeks of extreme pain after a filling fell out and the area became infected.\nI wasn't able to get a dentist appointment until today. I was however given antibiotics a week ago . So this helped .\nHowever the area is still painful and even today with the temporary filling the area is painful. \n\nI am booked in to have a permanent filling. \nBut I am concerned that the tooth actually needs removing instead. \n\nIs it normal to have the tooth hurt for a while after a temporary filling?\n\nAny advice appreciated , thanks Dr M: If the tooth is still painful, it does not necessarily mean that the tooth needs to be extracted. Could be that you need a root canal instead. dentalexplorer123: If you notice sensitivity to hot and cold stimuli, it's conceivable that your cavity is near the pulp or too deep. Traditionally, this would necessitate a root canal treatment. However, due to recent advances in dental techniques, it may be possible to avoid a root canal procedure.\nThe dentist can use a base liner technique, which involves applying a combination of ingredients such as glass ionomer cement or Biodentine using a layered approach, either directly onto the pulp, or indirectly, if the pulp chamber (tooth nerve) is not exposed.   A final layer of composite resin can then be added on top to seal everything firmly in place. This significantly reduces any risk of leakage into the pulp chamber and also aids in regenerating lost dentin.\nIt's crucial to note that these techniques only work if the decay has not reached the pulp chamber (tooth nerve). The closest the decay is to the pulp, the lesser the chances. If it has, you may ask your dentist to prescribe you a strong antibiotic like clindamycin and amoxicillin, which could potentially eradicate the infection without necessitating a root canal. In cases where the infection persists, root canal treatment might be unavoidable. By utilising a 2-layered or 3-layered base liner approach with GIC or/and Biodentine, and composite resin, you can create a strong, long-lasting dental restoration while minimising the risk of complications such as sensitivity or microleakage, and potentially avoid the root canal. Please be aware that temporary fillings don't bond well to the tooth structure like some permanent fillings, and leaving them in place for extended periods may lead to microleakage and infections.\nIn the meantime, a recent dental study on Tibetan herb Padma 28 (while not conducted in a mainstream setting) has purportedly found it may help prevent root canal infections."

Biodentine comes with a considerable expense tag, owing to its efficacy. As an alternative, Glass Ionomer Cement can also be used as a base and still get the job done satisfactorily, all while being readily accessible on the NHS. Looking at the image if this tooth was to undergo root canal therapy, there's a fair likelihood that it could be even more susceptible to fracture due to considerable loss of healthy tooth structure in the very center of the tooth, which would compromise its integrity, and wouldn't have a good prognosis in withstanding external pressure."

    "dialogue": "anxiouseverything22: Hello!\n\nSo, around two weeks ago, I believe I accidentally cut my gums between teeth 28 and 29 while flossing. There was some intermittent bleeding from the area. I knew it wasn't gingivitis, as the gum wasn't inflamed and I'd had a dental cleaning with a clean bill of health about three weeks or so prior. I made sure to be extra careful with the area over the next few days to a week, getting some bleeding over the next two days but noticeably less, with the bleeding disappearing entirely within 3-4 days. \n\nHowever, sensitivity in the area has persisted. I'm not sure if this is normal, but the gum in the area-- though not red typically-- would get reddened after using a water flosser, and this redness would linger for a bit (20 minutes to an hour). Additionally, using the water flosser would continue to sting in the area. The type of stinging was exactly what I'd associate with an open wound or cut: it wasn't soreness or a deep pain, but one that felt sharp and superficial. I use the highest pressure setting as my teeth are used to it. This doesn't happen with any of my other teeth. I use both water flossing and string floss, and did not notice any heightened sensitivity while string flossing.  \n\nThen, earlier this morning, while water flossing, the stinging was worse, and I noticed some (light) bleeding again despite it being two weeks later. When water flossing and string flossing tonight, there was no bleeding, but the redness persisted and later dissipated after flossing and water flossing. \n\nWhat should I do? Is it possible that the cut was healing and that I may have slightly reopened it? I don't see any signs of infection or anything like that. My dental insurance isn't great, so I would prefer any options that don't end with visiting the dentist. The cut isn't giving me any pain, but I worry about the fact that it hasn't fully healed by now-- especially because healing has happened relatively quickly when I've cut my gum other times. Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated! dentalexplorer123: Gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water several times daily to alleviate inflammation and support the healing process. If you have aloe vera juice at home, apply it directly to the affected area using a cotton swab and leave it on for 15-20 minutes before rinsing. In case of severe pain or persistent discomfort, consider using an over-the-counter product like Orabase or Orajel. Alternatively, GUM SensiVital toothpaste is available at Walmart or Amazon, and can be applied twice daily for 7 days using a cotton swab directly to the affected area. anxiouseverything22: Thank you so much!

The dentist claims that the crown would be a more permanent solution. If I choose to do a filling for the cavity, it may or may not hold as well the crown for a cavity that is located on the side of the tooth see the gums. dentalexplorer123: One possible approach is to drill the decayed area and employ a base liner method. In this scenario, Biodentine could be used to protect the pulp, given that the decay is near the pulp chamber. Once the Biodentine has been applied, the cavity can then be sealed using composite resin. By utilising a 2-layered or 3-layered base liner approach with GIC or/and Biodentine, and composite resin, you can create a strong, long-lasting dental restoration while minimising the risk of complications such as sensitivity or microleakage, and avoiding root canal."

    "title": "Upper front tooth with high decay",
    "dialogue": "RhondaWXYZ: My dentist says I have a very weird and unusual decay which starts above the gumline and goes straight up.  He says removing the decay is impossible because it is inaccessible since it is surrounded by supportive bone.  My options:  1) have a root canal done while leaving the decay and see how long THAT lasts.    2) pull the tooth and get an implant. Dr M: Do you have an x-ray to share? dentalexplorer123: There are ways to accomplish this. One approach is to establish an entry point for the surgical procedure. This might entail making an incision in the gum tissue above the tooth, followed by a gentle separation of the soft tissues from the underlying bone. Your dentist would likely need to remove a small portion of supportive bone surrounding the tooth to access the decay. Specialised instruments, such as bone files, are employed to carefully excavate the affected area while preserving healthy tissue. Once the bone has been removed and the decay is accessible, your dentist would utilise dental burs or other cutting tools to eliminate the decayed material, taking care not to harm any remaining healthy tooth structure. Following the removal of the decay, your dentist would fill the cavity with a suitable restorative material, employing direct or indirect capping with Biodentine or GIC in the depth and subsequently sealing with composite resin, depending on the severity and location of the decay.  Glass Ionomer Cement is relatively cheaper than Biodentine, and is a good restorative material that can get the job done. This could potentially obviate the need for a root canal procedure and save your tooth. I strongly advise seeking a second opinion from a qualified dentist. Furthermore, a dentist could also use guided access by employing a CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) scan to obtain a comprehensive view of the affected tooth and surrounding structures to remove the decay. A CBCT scan typically costs between $100 and $200. An X-ray would be a more affordable option to begin with and often gets the job done most of the time.  By utilising a 2-layered or 3-layered base liner approach with GIC or/and Biodentine, and composite resin, you can create a strong, long-lasting dental restoration while minimising the risk of complications such as sensitivity or microleakage, and avoid root canal.\n\nmicroleakage."

Now, two weeks ago I had my wisdom tooth extracted (the one marked), my dentist recommended it because of the way it is arranged and because I had pericoronitis, I followed his instructions and did it, I intended to stop there, but now I know that if I don't extract the top one, the tooth can (and will) overerupt and I'm afraid that if I don't extract the other side, there could be an imbalance in my bite, I would really like to stop there, I wouldn't want any more extractions, I'm confident that that lower wisdom tooth will straighten out, it has too much room and will compensate for my missing premolar, but I think there is no other option , or if anyone has any opinion on what solution I can take, short or long term, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much for reading me!\n\nPd: a solution I thought of is to somehow bring my molars 1 and 2 back a little to touch my wisdom tooth and avoid over-eruption or is that too difficult? I really don't want any more extraction, now I know that prophylactic extractions are becoming less and less recommended Dr M: Your other lower wisdom tooth will unfortunately not straighten out. Even with the missing pre-molar, there clearly won't be enough space for it to erupt fully. The best recommendation would be to remove all the remaining wisdom teeth. The over-eruption of the top one, on the side that you already extraction, will eventually happen, but it takes years. You can monitor it and only extract it when necessary, but it would be easier to remove the remaining 3 in one go. The left lower wisdom has a high risk of damaging the adjacent molar. juanflores22: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tYour other lower wisdom tooth will unfortunately not straighten out.

Hi Dr., thank you so much for you reply  ! if you don't mind, could you give me a reason why there's not chance my wisdom tooth won't straighten out? Dr M: The roots of the wisdom tooth are fully developed. Which means their growth and movement potential is minimal.

    "dialogue": "Tigerlily: Hi all\n\nNine days ago, on the Sunday, I started to have toothache so I went to see my Dentist the next morning, Monday 24th. The Dentist did an examination and an x ray but couldn't see anything wrong, so put some desensitising paste on and said it could be as I grind my teeth (I already knew I did that) and am worried about an upcoming hospital appointment so might be grinding more.\n\nThe pain came back after maybe two or three hours, so I called again on Tuesday and Wednesday and ended up back there on Thursday, but with another Dentist. The second Dentist did another examination and looked at my x ray, said I will likely need a root canal & crown or an extraction and to see my Dentist again this Monday for a review & extraction (I couldn't afford a root canal so initially wanted that). She did nothing to help the pain. I understand nothing could be done that day in terms of root canal or extraction, plus she didn't want me to decide in the heat of the moment when in pain and wanted to see if the pain went away, or localised to help them to know which tooth\n\nSo, I turn up this Monday and my Dentist only had a review booked in (despite Reception asking me to eat before the appointment, and me asking if he'd have time to do the extraction after ... she said he would as they'd moved other appointments around). Another examination and look at the x ray, he decides I may have a tiny crack inside of the tooth that is too small to see on the x ray but is on/near a nerve and some infection has got in. He thinks grinding more may have caused this crack (I do have a mouthguard but always gagged so didn't use it, but started to the moment he said it could be due to grinding, with no problems)\n\nHe's given me Antibiotics (1 pills 3x a day for 5 days) 500mg and booked me for the root canal 31st July. This is a private dental practice. Dentist claims he can't prescribe painkillers but two GPs say he can as does a list Dentists can prescribe from. I have had to come off of Lithium (for Bipolar) which is a risk, and cancel a blood test for it, so I can take Ibuprofen but really I need to be on the Lithium and not on Ibuprofen until the root canal. I got told removing the tooth, as I had 4x adult teeth removed as a kid for braces (1 in each quarter), would be a problem without an implant/denture, which is more expensive than a root canal. \n\nIs it true Dentists can't prescribe painkillers if weeks to wait for a root canal and paracetamol and co-codamol 8/500 don't help enough? Will this infection be gone (especially as 1-2 doses may not be absorbed which he says is ok) or am I at risk of it spreading? He says there's some swelling around the bad tooth, it is the only tooth I have a filling in which was done as a kid (maybe age 6 or 7) fell out for 10 to 15yrs, got refilled (almost the whole tooth) and has been ok until now. It's at the top, I think it's a molar, it's third from the back and I do have wisdom teeth but not sure where the previously removed tooth came from. I'm so worried about severe pain and/or the infection spreading and am terrified to just extract it without any restoration\n\nThanks to any who read this far"

My dentist said there's a need to extract the wisdom tooth and then do a root canal treatment on the molar which is probably needed rather than just a filling.\nIt it possible to extract the bad molar and try to straighten the wisdom tooth (which is not rotten) to replace it? I am over 25 and my wisdom tooth are developed and mostly grew. The rest of my teeth are straight (naturally). \nAnd even if it's possible, do you think it's worth it? it would probably take a few years and maybe I should just treat the molar and stay with it after exacting the wisdom tooth. Dr M: It depends. You would need the opinion from an orthodontist. They will take different x-rays to determine if the required movement can indeed take place.\nThere is also a chance that if you remove the wisdom tooth, either the adjacent tooth could be damaged to such an extent that it would need removal as well, or the decay on the adjacent molar could extend into the root, which means that a root canal is not an option. jamvart: Can you please estimate what are the chances that the adjacent tooth is too damaged to be repaired? I know it can't be fully determined without treatment, but I just want to know if the chances to save it are decent or not. I understand it would just be an estimation. Dr M: Based on this x-ray , I would say less than 50%. The distal cavity seems like it might be going horizontal or below the bone. But you can only say definitively once the wisdom tooth has been removed. jamvart: Update: I sent the x ray to 3 different orthodontists and they all said that based on the x ray it seems impossible to move it to replace the molar. So I had that wisdom tooth extracted today. My dentist also cleaned some of the molar and put a temporary filling. He hasn't cleaned deep enough yet, but he thinks that the tooth can be saved and maybe even without a root canal treatment and only with a deep filling, but we will know for sure only after a week when the molar is fully treated.\n\nThanks for the help.

Well I got the work done in Feb and in April things started to level out. However, I still get random aches and discomfort above the tooth (2 out of 10 pain scale).

Dr M: Can't see any clear abscess on the tooth, but it does seem like the filling is very deep and most likely touching the mesial horn of the pulp or nerve chamber. In such a case, the inflammation becomes irreversible, which might lead to future root canal treatment. A CBCT scan might not be a bad idea, since it tells you a lot more detail about the anatomy of the tooth. Root canal treatments on molars can sometimes be very difficult. Even in an extraction case, that tooth might be a difficult one, since it appears that the tooth has roots that are in the maxillary sinus. johnnybegood2024: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCan't see any clear abscess on the tooth, but it does seem like the filling is very deep and most likely touching the mesial horn of the pulp or nerve chamber.

KVMCruces: Hi Julia,\n\nDon't believe that it has anything to do with your teeth. Appears to be a canker sore but you can never be too sure though so best thing to do is check with your dentist. W1ll1am: Hey! Did you find out what it was and how to treat it? I have the exact same thing... W1ll1am: I went to see a dentist and he told me it's just a big ulcer and that it will go away in 2 to 3 weeks. Mine would hurt a lot when I was eating so he gave me a syrup that basically numbs ur whole mouth so that u wouldn't feel discomfort or pain while eating. you should go get it if u have the same problem. He also said the cause of ulcers is lack of sleep, stress, lack of vitamin so go get some multivitamins gummies in ur grocery store Trinity: Help the doctors don’t know what it is my cheek is swelling amd I have a huge gash in the back of my inner cheek that looks like x their is no white it’s just a huge gash and is sore it seems to be getting bigger.

Throughout the tooth does not hurt, if you do not eat on this side of course. In this case is it better to extract the tooth and place an implant with a crown in place of this tooth or is it better to place a crown, and also is it necessary to place a crown on the neighbouring healthy tooth in order to distribute the load evenly or does it have no effect? Dr M: You will need to determine the extent of the crack first. For that you would need to take an x-ray and do a clinical exam. If the crack is right through,and involves the root of the tooth for example, then an extraction would be indicated. It is not indicated to crown the tooth next to the one in question, since that would lead to unnecessary damage of that tooth. A crown is designed in such a way to distribute forces equally."

Would I feel any immediate if she had shaved them down too far? I just can't get them replaced due to the outrageous cost. Dr M: Although crowns can be adjusted, if they are adjusted too much, they can become too thin and then fracture. If the crowns are porcelain fused to metal, you can also expose the metal layer, which might be unaesthetic in certain cases. MattKW: If they were too high 2 years ago, you wouldn't've taken this long to notice the discrepancy.

I eat spicy food\n2. I eat anything with vinegar\n3. I am exercising\n4. I touch this area with a toothbrush\n\nI have had xrays and they say pulps are regressed and there are pulp stones in these teeth, but no treatment is necessary? Some dental trauma to one of the teeth, but again no treatment proposed. Have visited periodontiset endodontist, general dentist, maxillofacial surgeon. Taking painkillers from the doctor instead but they wear off and pain comes back.\n\nAny advice? Dr M: Any photos of your teeth or x-rays that you could share? Need more information bobbybly: Before\n\n\n\nAfter bobbybly: X ray and close up bobbybly: Any idea on this? Dr M: Although nothing is obvious, the sensitivity might be due to enamel loss on your teeth. Enamel loss on your teeth, exposes the dentin layer, which is prone to sensitivity. The reason why it might be more obvious after your visit to the hygienist, is that she might have cleaned off a layer of calculus, which covered the tooth, providing some relief to the sensitivity. This calculus layer had to be removed unfortunately, otherwise you sit with a host of other issues.\nBest option would be to use a sensitivity toothpaste like Sensodyne. Rub it on the teeth after brushing and leave it on. It won't take it away completely, but should make it manageable. You can brush with it as well. bobbybly: Thanks this is helpful. I have tried all of the above but still in constant pain day and night. It is especially bad when I exercise or touch the area. I have also been on amitryptiline from the GP for the pain which is quite severe at times, but this has not sorted it either. Are there any other options\n\nOne other question: I can't actually see any calculus on the back of the lower front teeth in the before photos? Can you? I can see some orangey stuff on the front but nothing on the back? What does calculus actually look like?\n\nMany thanks! Dr M: The photos are not taken at the correct angle in order to see calculus, but you can google photos. MattKW: Your photos reveal \"cupping\" erosion of tooth enamel, usually seen in people who have acidic foods or drinks , e.g. soft drinks, sports drinks, citrus fruits, wine, vinegar (acetic acid). While it is common to have sensitive teeth after a cleaning, it should settle within a few days, esp with use of desensitising toothpaste.\nHowever, if you have an acidic diet, it will give you hell. I remember the terrible pain I had after a day of wine-tasting when I followed up with salt-and-vinegar chips (crisps). \nGo back to plain water or milk for a couple of weeks and keep using desensitising toothpaste. Spit it out but don't rinse."

I'd say that the pain from the dry socket just starting to ease although i have had a sore throat since the initial extraction and still do. However what i am more concerned about is the piece of bone showing through my gum near the extraction. It's quite sharp when felt with my tongue and is probably the part that is still sore and doesn't feel as if my gum has healed over any of it at all.. Will my gum eventually grow over this piece of bone? I have attached a pic. Sorry for quality. Thanks Dr M: If it hurts, go back to your dentist, so that the sharp piece can be trimmed down. MattKW: Yes, happens sometimes as the healing tissue tightens over the sharp bone. The protruding bone can be removed under local anaesthetic, but dentist has to be wary of nearby lingual bone. I'd also suggest a chlorhex mouthwash for 2 weeks and to give up smoking (if you can) as this retards healing."

My baby tooth was very small, so the replacement had to be very small too. The dentist first ordered an implant, and it was too big. Then he ordered another one, and it ended up like this: the screw is visible because it is too big and there was very little space left for the filling. Also, I see some holes and cracks, but I don't know what they are. Can you tell me if you think the work is done correctly? Could a smaller screw have been used that would be completely covered by the implant? Thank you. Dr M: The size of the crown is determined by the available space between the adjacent teeth as well as the space available from the opposing tooth. Unfortunately, based on the type of implant placed, bone vs tissue level, it only allows for a very shallow access opening in certain cases. This does not mean anything was done incorrectly. Your anatomy determines the type of implant that can be placed.\nYou will just need to keep an eye on the filling. If it is a very thin layer, there is a high chance that it could wear down, and then would need replacement over time."

The pain was too much for me so I had multiple needles to try and numb it, I lost count of how many injections, but I was still feeling pain.  Eventually she stopped and told me to book in with the hygienist.  Long story short, I've been back multiple times since and saw other dentists at that practice and every time I've said that tooth is still hurting.  One dentist said it must be the tooth behind it which we haven't filled yet, see how it goes after that.  It still hurt and I told them once again. They put some sort of sticky coating on my tooth to supposedly make it less sensitive.\nIt still hurt.  I told them I do not want to lose this tooth and they said no you won't lose it.

I told them again and again, it's still hurting.  I had the sticky coating stuff put on a few times and told to keep putting sensitive toothpaste on it.  So now it's April 2024 and I'm in severe pain.  For the first time they x-rayed it and told me I will need either root canal or extraction.  This has really upset me.  Why didn't they take it seriously from the beginning?  Is it standard to tell a patient with toothache to put sensitive toothpaste on it? Why wouldn't they have told me previously that my tooth could die, since they are now saying they knew this could happen.  Instead they never said a word, never did an xray and just said it's a sensitive tooth. johnnybegood2024: Hello\n\nI am a patient as well and I have a similar problem.

If not too bad, you can wait a month. Hello\n\nThe tooth ache after the deep removal and replacement has slowly been getting better. I added some supplements to help with nerve repair and inflammation. What I'm wondering about is a possible allergy or sensitivity to the materials. The Dr use ribond along with composite. As mentioned, this was a huge filling he removed and replaced. He spent 3 hours on it! After the dental work, I now have chronic dry mouth and allergic shiners. Is it possible the ribbond fibers or composite are causing these things? This whole situation has just been bizarre and I've never had any issues getting dental work before. Thanks! Dr M: Even though it is possible, it is extremely rare to be allergic to the material.  The dry mouth might be unrelated. Are you on any chronic asthma or blood pressure medication? johnnybegood2024: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tEven though it is possible, it is extremely rare to be allergic to the material.  The dry mouth might be unrelated. Are you on any chronic asthma or blood pressure medication? I see...nope, not on any meds. That's what's so weird about this whole situation -- I never had any issues going to the dentist for cleanings and fillings. However, after this filling removal and \"fiber reinforced filling\", all hell broke loose. It just blows my mind. But also it's important to note that I've never had ribbond fibers before. Perhaps that's the issue and not the composite? Dr M: If you are indeed allergic, you will have to go for an allergen test. johnnybegood2024: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIf you are indeed allergic, you will have to go for an allergen test. How would I know for sure if I am allergic to dental materials? Would there be obvious signs and symptoms? Thank you"

The pain radiates a lot. They are both heavily filled and the bottom one was filled 6 months ago and has been very sensitive since. The top one has a chip on the back of it and has for over a year. The dentist says I need to get root canal treatment but doesn't know which tooth as both are sensitive (though the bottom is more sensitive) and neither feel painful when tapped. I'm currently on amoxicillin. Do I definitely need root canal? Which tooth is it likely to be? Would a crown be necessary? Sorry I just don't really trust what my dentist says. Dr M: It sounds like you might need one based on the symptoms you are describing. Do you perhaps have any x-rays you could share, since that will allow us to give a more detailed opinion?\nTo determine if a crown is required, you need to have a look at the amount of sound tooth structure that is left. I, however, tell most of my patient to crown the tooth after a certain period, if the tooth has no symptoms and the root canal has been successful, based on a follow-up x-ray."

Initially a bit of enamel peg came out from bottom front tooth that dentist had put in during lockdown.  No pain or issues at this point so took first appointment which was 2 months away.  Carried on jogging a few times but then started to get mouth pain.  Eventually got in to dentist who thought initially the front tooth and rebooked back in a further 2 months for start of root canal.  \n\nPain got worse got emergency appointment dentist drilled into tooth and patched up some way.  Got worse again had to get another emergency appointment this time did xray can only see a slight change on gum/tooth aside of one drilled into.  \n\nDentist doesn’t think that is the cause put on antibiotics but not solved anything just made hubby feel worse.\n\nNow he is getting pretty down with the constant pain and tiredness with no obvious solution. \n\nThe pain /discomfort keeps moving now from front tooth to further round jaw and sometimes on top and into throat.  Always left side. \n\nAnyone had anything similar with an outcome? \n\nHe had something which seemed similar during lockdown and there was never an outcome he ended up in pain for 18mths back then and it somehow eventually eased.  He can’t face another 18 mths of pain again! Dr M: Do you have x-rays that you can share? Need more information to give an opinion zorba25: Unfortunately we don’t.  The dentist said she noticed that a tooth that had what looked like slight infection or something on previous xray re lockdown seemed to have a bit more or changed slightly on the current xray.  She didn’t think it would be that causing it though. \n\nStarting to think its a nerve or something.  Could running dislodge or trigger an issue as it seems to have triggered from then. Dr M: What does slight infection mean? Unfortunately more information is needed here in order to give an informed opinion. I have had patients with sinus related problems, that had referred pain to their teeth, that was exacerbated when they performed physical exercise. I still think a recent x-ray is need to provide more information. Doesn't help to speculate. zorba25: Thank you he is due back to the dentist mid November so I’ll see if we can get a photo of the xray.  Many thanks zorba25: Hubby still in pain with mouth.  Since last on here he had a front bottom tooth out and a bridge fitted but this hasn’t solved the issue.  \n\nHe is still in pain the dentist couldn’t find anything and referred him to the maxiofacial dept at the hospital he eventually got a cancellation in January and has since been waiting on a cone scan which his appointment is in a couple of weeks but we are not convinced it will show anything.  He then has to wait another month for his appointment to go back to see the consultant who is not convinced that it relates to facial issues. So 9 months on we are still no closer to solving the issue and stuck in between with Dentist saying facial and facial saying must be dental. \n\nHe has been on carmazapine which didn’t work and now been on duxlotine for 7 weeks but no sign of relief at present plus side effects are pretty much outweighing any benefit that may occur. \n\nHe is on high blood pressure medication and has read about calcium versions of this could be connected to tooth pain but no one seems to be interested in this.  The tooth /mouth pain started afound 3 months after starting the blood pressure tablets.  We have constantly thought it was starting running that triggered it but now we are wondering.

Dr M: Recession is also due to other factors, not only gum disease. Are you a smoker? Do you have any other systemic health issues? It sounds like you have the soft brushing under control. Some people, however, have what we call a thin gingival bio-type. They are more prone to developing these black triangles between teeth, even if the underlying bone is healthy and pocket depths are normal. These cases are sometimes treated with gingival grafts, in order to cover these spaces. \nYou can always go and see a periodontist for a consult, who can give more helpful advice.

    "dialogue": "WindSkurai: I am in need of advice on what should I do...\n\nOver the last two years I had some old silver fillings converted into crowns by my dentist's suggestion. I did not have any pain in my teeth at the time for years. The suggestion came due to the silver was starting to form gaps between their seal in the surface of the tooth. In total I had:\n\nCrowns on 32, 31, 1, 2, 3.\nRoot canals on 32, 31 and 3 (after crowns were completed due to lingering pain).\nThe crowns were done by location in four separate procedures:\n\n1 and 2.\n31 and 32\n3\nAnd then a replacement for 2 due to heavy bleeding.\nIn between procedure 2 and 3 I had persistent pain through the day which resulted in 3 root canals. The root canals were in 2, 31 and 32. My endodontist has been fantastic. His work is always smooth, never hurts and he often tells me just how text book perfect my root system is and that its a pleasure to work on. He took xrays of my top and bottom right before leaving to confirm there are no infections in any of the sides remaining teeth.\n\nAfter procedure 4 I was told that I would need a night guard to protect the new crowns from grinding they suspected was happening due to I'd developed a loud click in my jaw which I experienced through each day and generally one and only one time in the morning. So after insurance said they would cover it I got the night guard which I have wore every night now for 2 months.\n\nSince the work, I have experienced daily pain over the last two years because of this work. I have flossed a large piece of cement out from between 1 and 2 which thankfully relieved a lot of the pressure and sensitivity I was experiencing in 1. The bottom teeth 31 and 32 feel fine in the morning even though my TMJ click is fairly persistent with one clear click at this point. By evening though 31 and 32 are very sore. They feel as if I have chewing gum wrapped around them and are painful to touch in a dull way. They also feel slippery if I try to grind on them with eating or without. Almost like they are too smooth from all the adjustments that were done. And lastly, over the last month with the bite guard I have started to feel as if my bite is changing heavily on that side. My 6 and 7 teeth are definitely further away from my lower row of teeth and very difficult to touch should I try on purpose, but I do feel my lower teeth clashing into my upper teeth on accident at times now too. Which feels really painful and I worry they'll fall out from the new pressure that 6 and 7 seem to be having. I have even started chewing more on the left trying to relieve the issues, but with no luck.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nI have a meeting scheduled with my dentist this week to discuss new ideas as I've lost a lot of faith that they can complete this work and that I will likely need all new crowns and bite guard... I'm assuming they will not re-imburse me for the thousands I spent on the work no matter how poorly the result ended up. I'm tired of being in pain. I would like to be able to chew on lettuce without feeling discomfort. Please help me find a way to fix this!\n\nThank you in advance."

I get mild, brief pain when any food or drink touches the area between those teeth, and if the food or drink is hot, cold, or extremely sweet, forget it--the pain will almost bring me to tears (though it lasts only a few seconds). This pain/sensitivity started about 6 months ago and only got worse. I'm 24 years old and female. I don't smoke or drink. I floss daily and brush 2x/day for a while now.\n\nThe doctor performed the cold test, and I had sharp pain, lasting about 3 seconds. He looked at my X-rays and found that I had signs of external resorption in 3 molars. (Although almost all of my teeth have developed similar sensitivity to lesser degrees. He only took X-rays of the ones I said were hurting the most.) He referred me to an endodontist that I will be seeing in 2 days.\n\nAfter googling what external resorption means, I'm freaking out. Most sources are saying that in the majority of cases, the teeth will need to be extracted, which is alarming since all of my teeth have developed the same sensitivity/pain to varying degrees. My dentist couldn't answer why the resorption occurred and said it could be idiopathic. Does anyone have any theories? How do I prevent further resorption?\n\nI've never had trauma. I did braces from about 2013-2015 and Smile Direct Club invisible aligners from about 2017-2019. I've been wearing my retainers nightly since completing my last alignment treatment. Throughout the day, my teeth will shift slightly and putting on the retainers at night will be a bit tight/painful. I always thought this wasn't normal but my dentist/ortho said it was and some people just have faster relapse speeds than others.\n\nAs of about a month, I also developed some other symptoms I believe may be related like occasional, mild ear and jaw pain (ears will feel mildly painful pressure, jaw is more of an ache and stiffness. I'll have the urge to open wide and stretch it out) and random, brief numbness or pain in my hands and feet 10-20 times a day.

They didn't check for their medical history, didn't see them face to face or over the phone even and didn't ask about any allergies. I was under the impression that only dentists can prescribe these drugs.

Thanks for the reply, the antibiotics were Amoxicillin so i don't think a Therapist can issue these. There is also the ethical issue that these have been taken from the practice without been recorded or patient issued and i'm sure the practice manager and the dentist that owns the surgery knows nothing about it that's why morally i don't want to get them into trouble if it is just the one bad egg doing this.

    "title": "Broken Tooth, Likely Cracked Tooth Syndrome- Does a Root Canal resolve the issue?",
    "dialogue": "DentalNewbie: Hello everyone - newbie here so please forgive me for any silly questions. I’m looking for a better understanding of potential treatments for an issue I’ve had, so hope I am posting in the correct place.\n\nAround two years ago, whilst eating breakfast a piece of a lower molar broke off - I’d estimate maybe around 30% of the tooth. \n\nI visited my then dentist, who carried out a filling for me. \n\nHowever as time went on, I found I wasn’t really comfortable chewing on that tooth, and eventually any time I chew on hard foods I almost got a sharp or shooting pain, as if hitting a nerve. Not nice at all.\n\nI’ve since moved house and moved to a new private dental practice. I asked them to review and he advised that we start with the least invasive treatment, and see how we go from there.\n\nX-rays have not shown any visible cracks, and therefore the suggestion was:\n\n- new filling (apparently a different material to the first one to see if it helped)\n-if that fails, try a crown\n- if that doesn’t fix the pain, do a root canal.\n\nSo far, the filling didn’t work- the dentist suggesting that there may be a hairline crack that could be flexing when biting down.\n\nWe’ve now put a permanent crown on, but again it still hurts to chew hard food. I don’t have any pain other than when biting or chewing, but I have noticed sensitivity to hot, cold, and sugary foods. I sometimes feel as if I’m feeling not a pain or an ache, but just a very very light throbbing - perhaps as you would towards the end of gums healing after dental surgery. It’s hard to describe. \n\nIt’s very costly to keep going through each treatment - Root Canal is the next option- does it sound like a sensible treatment for this particular issue? The dentist has suggested that it essentially removes the nerve and therefore the pain should disappear if a root canal is performed successfully. I’m just slightly worried about drilling through a tooth that’s already lost a piece of itself and been filled and crowned already. \n\nOne final question- does a root canal have to be done with a rubber dam used? I have a big fear of them. At my first filling with the new dentist for this broken tooth, we had a scary incident where the rubber dam clamp pinged off mid surgery, and something went down my throat which I swallowed and was very uncomfortable as I felt it slide down through the chest\n\nThe dentist advised me to go to A&E, fearing it could have been the clamp I ingested. X-rays didn’t locate it, so we can only assume it might have been filling or tooth that I swallowed, but I’m obviously worried now after that. I thought the dam was actually there to stop anything going down the throat?\n\nAny helpful information on these things would be greatly appreciated. Dr M: Yes, a rubber dam is required, since it prevent you from swallowing any instruments or materials that might be harmful, and also helps to isolate the tooth, to prevent moisture contamination of the root canal system, which might lead to future failure if not done adequately.\nIt is important to note, that although a root canal might remove the nerve, they don't last forever, and if there is indeed a crack, and the crack involves any part of the root of the tooth, the tooth will need to be taken out.\n\nMy opinion would be to ask for a referral to an endodontist. It might be more expensive, but they have access to 3D CBCT scans, which might increase the chance of spotting a crack in one of the roots, and increase the likelihood of the root canal lasting an extended period. Brause: I have a similar history. Tooth 46 cracked (2nd last on the lower right). Dentist tried to fix it with a filling, but it cracked again.\n\nI was referred to an endodontist who did CBCT and X-ray for the periapical diagnosis, and palpation/percussion and cold test for the pulpal diagnosis.\n\nThe imaging revealed \"rarefying osteitis\", which is a general term for any infection around the apex. A root canal treatment was performed, which failed from the getgo: my pain never subsided. Reason was most likely a root fracture, which was not visible in the imaging.\n\nAfter 11 weeks of aggressive non-treatment (\"waiting\"), the tooth was extracted.\n\nIf the root canal treatment had been successful, I would have needed a crown after a few months as the treated (\"dead\") tooth would become brittle over time and prone to fracturing.\n\nSince tooth 46 is in a strategically important position (taking up a lot of chewing stress), I regret having attempted root canal treatment. Time and money wasted in my opinion.\n\nA friend of mine had one of his second molars extracted...and never replaced with an implant. I will have my first molar replaced, though. Expensive."

Root canal treatments does sometimes take a while ( month or so ) to settle. It could be however that the filling the dentist placed after completing the treatment is a bit high, causing strain on the ligaments around the tooth and then leading to pain. If that is the case, the occlusion just needs to be adjusted a bit. Best place to start is to back to your dentist. In the mean time you can take any anti-inflammatory meds. flomodental: If you suspect your root canal treatment might not have worked, see a dentist to diagnose the problem. Signs of failure include pain, swelling, pimples, bad taste, or discoloration. Treatment options include root canal retreatment or extraction. If retreatment isn't feasible, extraction might be necessary. Discuss the pros and cons with your dentist. FloMo Dental can provide an examination, review your X-rays, and refer you to qualified specialists within our network based on your needs. Remember, early intervention is key!"

    "dialogue": "MagnusMessi: hey,\n\nI recently went to a dentist for having white filling in my front right tooth which was chipped. After the filling was done, when I was chewing the food my bottom teeth were slightly hitting back of front teeth, and I have no idea why (maybe the dentist had to apply some white filling in the back of the chipped front tooth as well). Because of this discomfort, I visited the dentist again and they did some trimming at the back of the front right tooth.\n\nAfter the trimming, I am constantly filling some kind of emptiness as if the back of front right tooth is removed or something. This is affecting me mentally as well my sleep. I have mild pain but no other symptoms.\n\nI did visit the dentist again, they checked for numbness, I did feel the tooth and at the end they said to give more time so that I can get used to it. But I am not feeling confident about it due to my other health conditions where my mind is has become very sensitive (and this sudden change is difficult for me to bear).\n\nI have posted the images here. The back of left front teeth is thicker than the right tooth, so I am sure that back of right front tooth is trimmed more than it should have or it has been completely removed.\n\nIt would be great to know what can I do to overcome this emptiness feeling. Is it possible to have some kind of filling to make back of right front tooth same as the one on the left? And will I am able to feel normal after getting such treatment?\n\nThank you in advance. Dr M: A lot of times a bit of filling is placed on the back of the tooth to strengthen the filling. If this extra bit, affected your bite, we usually adjust the occlusion until it is even or balanced. The empty feeling that you might be experiencing, might be due to the fact that the occlusion is not perfectly balanced. More adjustment, sometimes even on the adjacent tooth might be required. \nI would give it time. Most of the time you get used to it. If you start experiencing headaches or if the front tooth becomes sensitive, more adjustment can then be done. MagnusMessi: Thank you very much for reply @Dr M. Apologies I did not get a notification of your reply, so I wasn't aware of it. \n\nWhat you mentioned makes sense. It could be that the filling in the back of front right tooth is either trimmed or is completely removed and as a result the occlusion is imbalanced. I just hope that this is the issue and not any kind of permanent numbness/emptiness.\n\nI will visit my dentist again to see if see if they can help. MagnusMessi: Ok, so I just visited my dentist (a senior one and not same as last one) and my analysis about front tooth back trimming was correct. Because of the back trimming, the tooth (as a whole) is now thinner which is the reason why I feel emptiness. I discussed with the doc if it would be possible to add some filling in the back so that I can feel a bit normal like before, however the dentist said that if they try to add the composite/white filling in the back, my bottom teeth may not perfectly sit with my top teeth (I guess this is same as occlusion imbalance?) and so to wait more and get used to it. \n\nI understand her concern in going for further treatment, however I really want help in this and it has been 1 month and that feeling of emptiness still exists (and I am sure this will exist going forward). What should I do here? Is there something I can try at home? Should I get a third opinion?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nUPDATE: Forgot to mention that the doctor applied white filling completely in my front right tooth from only the front and not the back, to make tooth a bit heavier and also because it was slightly asymmetrical in size compared to front left tooth. However, this treatment is not improving my feeling of the tooth (it improves the look). Dr M: You can get another opinion if you want. It is a bit difficult to give an exact opinion without physically seeing you. You can either add filling on the back, or adjust the adjacent filling a tiny bit, until it feels \"'equal''. MagnusMessi: Again, thank you for your reply @Dr M. I will probably provide it more time and if it continues to affect me mentally, then I will consult a different dentist at a different surgery as both dentists which I have seen are part of the same surgery. MagnusMessi: @Dr M I was just googling connection between teeth and brain fog (as I am suffering from it ever since I had my front right back tooth got trimmed) and I have learnt that there is a connection between them.\n\nIn my situation could you recommend something to me, so that I can understand why I am having these brain fogs daily? Without extra composite filling in the back, is there any way to simulate of having the filling in the affected tooth (so that I can feel my tooth better)? Dr M: The best would be to see another dentist, so that the filling can either be built up, to achieve balance or the adjacent tooth trimmed down, to achieve balanced occlusion.\nUnfortunately the only OTHER way is  to stop thinking about it. If one becomes obsessed with a dental issue, it remains an issue, even if the problem was solved. \nThe ''brain fog'' that you are experiencing, might be related to another medical issue. MagnusMessi: Again thank you for your reply @Dr M. I am going to visit my dentist soon and see what they can suggest and offer. I really do hope to overcome it as soon as possible. Hopefully it gets resolved on its own.\n\nAs you suggested I will try to not think about it. MagnusMessi: @Dr M I recently saw a different dentist and they did not agree with building up filling in the back of my front right tooth as they said that it won't help me. They did apply ice-based solution in the back of the tooth to understand the tooth sensitivity and I did feel the cold effect and so the tooth sensitivity is normal.\n\nI am in desperate in need of help as I really do not want to live like this where I am having constant brain fogs (as my natural tooth was trimmed). I found some details here: https://www.totalfamilydentalgroup.com/blog/articles/tooth-loss-and-memory-loss/\n\nIs there any other alternative to white/composite filling that can be applied in the back of the tooth? If not, what should I do?\n\nThank you in advance."

    "dialogue": "Jo90: I have an X--Ray from 12 months ago, and one from today (attached). I would appreciate an expert opinion as to whether anything has changed and whether any procedures are necessary. Thank you. Dr M: It looks like your second molar on the left has a peri-apical infection. Can't see clearly if the distal root has a fracture as well? More advanced imaging is required, but at the very least a root canal treatment is indicated on this tooth. Jo90: Thank you for your reply. Are you referring to the tooth next to the wisdom tooth?\nIs that something that only shows on today's X-ray, or did it show on last year's?\nI have never had any problems with my teeth apart from once in May 2022 when I suddenly experienced excruciating pain all over the left side of my face. It lasted for about ten days, gradually subsiding. At that time, my dentist couldn't find any cause for it and suggested it could be a result of clenching my teeth in my sleep, although she noted a 4mm pocket in the gum of the lower left tooth next to the wisdom tooth. Since then, I have had no symptoms and no pain, visit my dentist and hygienist regularly, have good oral hygiene and avoid sugary foods. Hence, it was a shock, when she also told me today that I needed root canal work. She said the gum had improved and the tooth was good but there was bacteria in the bone under the tooth that might not even be cured by root canal work. How could this have happened so suddenly; could it be connected to the issue I experienced in May 2022? Is there any alternative treatment? Dr M: It sounds like you might have cracked your tooth. I am referring to the tooth next to the wisdom tooth yes. It does not show on the first x-ray, but only on the second x-ray. It might just be that in the first x-ray it was too soon for any changes to appear. A deep pocket might also be an indication of a root fracture. I would suggest maybe asking for a CBCT, just to rule out any fractures. A CBCT provides a 3D image of the tooth. If there is a root fracture,a root canal will be of no use and then the only option would be to extract the tooth and consider replacement options.\nThe grinding should also be addressed as soon as possible. Brause: I can report a similar case.\n\nI had cracked the crown of the right tooth (first molar #46) when biting on an almond in early summer of 2023. After filling, it cracked again...then I got 24/7 toothache.\n\nFirst X-ray taken in early September 2023 (and a CBCT scan, which showed a periapical infection, like yours). Interesting that the X-ray did not show the infection.\n\nThe CBCT scan did not show a root fracture, but the endodontist suspected one (root fractures have to have a certain width and the CBCT a certain resolution/field of view to image fractures: this is not always possible).\n\nAn oral surgeon in my family confirmed what I read in the literature: once one has a periapical infection, a root canal is required. If there is a fracture, the tooth is lost.\n\nRoot canal treatment was initiated in early October, however not completed, as pain did not subside within 11 weeks. The tooth was extracted just before Christmas.\n\nThe second X-ray was taken just before the extraction. The oral surgeon in my family interpreted a root fracture (though it may be ambiguous). The root clearly shows the infection (black arrow).\n\nThe oral surgeon who extracted the tooth reported a root fracture.\n\nI never had any issues with my teeth before and also have my teeth cleaned every 6 months. The root fracture was assigned to bruxism. I recently received a custom-made nightguard to avoid such fractures in the future.\n\nWhat I learnt...I can quote from a peer reviewed article: \"...They [vertical root fractures] are also difficult to diagnose, as they mimic other conditions. Hence, the diagnosis of vertical root fractures requires more of a predictive rather than a definitive identification. A cumulative assessment of the clinical signs and symptoms and the radiographic features may help us reach a definitive diagnosis...\"\n\nGood luck!\n\nP.S. According to the literature I read, a periapical abscess/infection takes 2-10 months to appear radiographically following the pulp infection (inside the root). My dentist spoke of 2-3 months. Brause: Spot the difference (inside the black rectangles). Brause: urbansmiles said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDear Brause,\nas per the x-ray, visible changes are not there. however if your tooth has become more sensitive or if there is any pain, do consult and Endodontist. the filling is close to the nerve though.

This is the short version:  I asked my dentist if she could make me a new partial and she began immediately by taking molds of my teeth (upper and lower) While it was being made, she called me into the office for some additional measurements.  On the day of delivery, the partial did not fit.  She was so upset because she didn’t know what was going on.  She finally came to the conclusion that the lab put a tooth into the partial where I already have a natural tooth in my mouth.  She wanted to do an immediate extraction on that tooth. I refused and i still don’t have what i paid for.   Love to get your input.  Thank you. Dr M: Why would she extract a tooth and not remove the extra tooth on the partial only? Is your natural tooth decayed? You do not extract a tooth if there is nothing wrong with it mstamis: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhy would she extract a tooth and not remove the extra tooth on the partial only? Is your natural tooth decayed? You do not extract a tooth if there is nothing wrong with it I don’t know why she didn’t suggest removing the tooth from the partial.  I wasn’t aware that could be done.  My natural tooth is fine as far as I know but what bothers me is how something like this happens when molds are done of my mouth prior to the creation of the partial.  I am completely at a loss. The dentist won’t admit error. Nor will she say the lab is responsible of any wrongdoing.  But I know for a fact that I didn’t grow a tooth overnight.  The story the dentist and her office manager are telling is that I was aware of a tooth needing to be extracted on day of delivery and are claiming they can prove it by my signature.  Clearly, I know I never signed anything of the sort so I asked her to send me a copy of such document.  When I reviewed it, I was appalled at the unprofessional behavior of Dr. X.  I am attaching a copy of what they say is proof of my knowledge of extraction on day of delivery. Apparently, they think I’m an idiot because they thought the insertion of details in the form of “handwritten“ words, that were obviously entered after my captured signature, which is just as questionable because i wasn’t required to date it, that’s odd. mstamis: They have $400.00 of mine, which I paid them on February 22, 2023.  I was supposed to pay the remainder of $400.00 on the day of delivery which never happened because of scenario foretold above.  It’s been a year, and I am still without what I paid for.  I have lost all confidence in that dentist to be able to make me a proper device.  I don’t think it’s unreasonable for me to ask for a refund so I can go get what I need.  I’ve asked them several times to return my money but they refuse. Dr M: I would also suggest asking for a refund. If proper consent was not obtained, and if they want to extract a healthy tooth, I would not trust them with the treatment going forward. It is completely possible that she sent the wrong tooth numbers to the lab. Ask for all your records as well as x-rays and obtain a second opinion from another dentist. mstamis: Thank you for your time to help me with this.  I will keep you posted as to any news about the outcome.  Thanks again."

I keep taking OTC pain meds because the awareness of these teeth is making me very nervous.\n\nIs this awareness/pain/sensitivity normal after trauma? If so, how long does this type of thing last?

The internet searches I've been doing aren't helpful so would appreciate any insight.\n\nEDIT: I have briefly held an ice cube on my 2 front teeth, and the teeth next to each front tooth, and can feel the cold on all four teeth in the same way ie uncomfortable cold and need to remove the ice due to the sensation.  After removal of the ice, the repaired front tooth and tooth next to it throbbed longer than the unaffected teeth by minutes but they were sensitive before this 'test' so not sure if this is related or how helpful this 'test' is less than a week after injury.\n\nI don't know if this is helpful information but thought I would advise just in case.\n\nThank you very much.

My dentist is in another country so they can’t see properly what I see. But it doesn’t look like it’s wearing well. Is this normal for veneers to be almost like “brushing off” after only 3 weeks? Or does it just need to be polished again? \n\nPlease comment only if you’ve had resin veneers or are a dentist/ assistant etc. honestdoc: I think you are pointing to the veneer/teeth margins.  They tend to be thin due to minimal drilling on the area.  Modern materials are stronger and will resist wear.  Composites are less strong than ceramics (much more expensive).  I don't see concerns in those areas for now.  You can always have it rebonded.  Depending on your bite, you may consider ceramic veneers in the future.  If your bite is aggressive, you can fracture those veneers. NNN: Thank you for answering! So, is this normal after almost 3 weeks? Will polishing them just smooth it out? There’s no gap in the teeth and veneer, it just seems like I’m brushing off layers of resin?

I just know it was composite resin material. I've been reading a lot about glass-ionomer fillings, which are different from composite resin.\n\nI also think or sense that our electronics, along with certain chemicals or additives that are ever abundant in our food supply like citric acid [drinks, chips, and fruits of course] are wearing down these glass-ionomer fillings faster than they would have, before the high-speed data infrastructures like 5G were released. BEcause the friction of the polymers has some sort of magnetic pull on the foodstuffs and chemicals which creates a nano-friction or something like that, they are more prone to building up or polymerizing creating a glue which causes the glass to wear down and maybe form more fissures etc."

So instead of renewing my crowns he popped my existing crowns off and replaced both in composite/cosmetic bonding the price was the same as it took so long.He said that if they fail or crack he will replace at his cost with crowns.\n\nAesthetically I’m amazed my teeth look perfect much better than I imagine crowns could ever look on my front teeth.\n\nI’m super worried about them failing especially when he hasn’t given me a time frame for replacing them if they do fail. So much that I had myself in tears over it I’m scared to eat anything that isn’t soft. He has assured me that it is safe to do so but I just can’t help but worry.\n\nI have always fully trusted my dentist I’ve been with him for 10 years and I moved 2.5 hours away and travel to him after trying a few others that I didn’t feel were upto standard.\n\nAm I being silly and worrying over nothing?\n\nLooking for other peoples opinions on this and if anyone has had the same done and it’s been fine?\n\nAlso k should mention it’s a private clinic not nhs Dr M: The main disadvantages of composite bonding, is the fact that they will discolor over time. Crowns don't change colour, but any filling material does. Composite fillings are also not usually as strong as normal crowns. Although the dentist did check the bite, to make sure they don't take too much pressure, there is still a risk of fracture if biting into anything that is too hard.\nThe results look good.\nHopefully the dentist sticks to his word of replacing it free of charge, if they break.

Thank you so much for the reply I appreciate it. When you say fracture do you mean fracture to the composite bonding or to the tooth underneath? \n\nThe reason he has opted for this I understand is because anytime one and crowns they are never quite right and look two wide and bulky. The reason I wanted new ones was due to a receding gum line around the crowns. I underwent gum contouring beforehand. The worry was that the gum would reject the new crowns again. \n\nIt’s catch 22 really . I’m going to ask him what sort of time frame he is giving me with them when I return. Dr M: Usually the composite fillings fracture. Not the teeth underneath. In terms of the crowns, crowns usually have a very smooth margin, and if placed in the correct area, i.e not in the biological zone, they should not have any effect on the gums receding. Has your dentist investigated other causes for  the receding gums? A lot of times it is due to habits, such as brushing too hard or using the incorrect brushing technique. Danielle94: Thanks again for the reply. I actually went to see a gum specialist regarding the recession and he said my front tooth was over erupting and it possibly could have been a factor but other than that he said that he could see no reason why my gums would be receding  said that there ere perfectly healthy couldn’t understand it. \n\nAs I am happy with the results of the composite on my next visit I am going to ask what time frame my dentist is giving me with these and I’ll take it from there. I’m starting to feel more comfortable with them ( they felt very alien at first )"

Knowing nothing about dentistry my self I do not know the proper course to correct this before it becomes a bad issue for my tooth. So I have a few questions;\n1, Is it ok to just let it go with normal dental care and this will not jeopardize the tooth?\n2, Is this something that can be repaired to protect the tooth? \n  2a, If its repairable just what can be done?\n\nI attached 2 probe pictures. The chipped area has not changed in approximately 6 months. It does not bleed but the coloration is yet another concern for me.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated. Dr M: The area can definitely be fixed with a dental filling. Did the dentist take an x-ray to rule out any decay that might be the reason for the chip? Erik: Yes. Full x-ray set was done. No decay detected anywhere.  What makes me wonder is why both the hygienist and the dentist would suggest leaving it alone. Would the filling just be for appearance or would it protect the tooth? Dr M: The filling in that area is sometimes technically difficult, due to being close to the gum line. Exposed dentine like that might later on lead to cold sensitivity and a filling might help to cover the exposed dentine. If there is no decay detected however, and you are not experiencing any cold sensitivity, you can only monitor it for now. Erik: Thank you very much for your response. Having limited knowledge in dentistry it just seemed odd to not cover an area on the tooth that was not naturally exposed. I just didn't want to risk an otherwise healthy tooth.

I recently learned that the correct way to close my mouth is my molars touching and my upper teeth slightly in front of the bottom ones , i've tried to breath like this but i've been having headaches , is it because of the splinting? Dr M: What you are referring to is actually called a fixed wire retainer. This is common practice after ortho treatment has been completed, in order to prevent relapse or movement of your front teeth. In terms of the headaches, I would suggest mentioning this to your dentist. It might be that you have a grinding issue and in need of a bite plate."

    "dialogue": "daintybow88: Hi everyone\n\nI would just like a second opinion if possible. I had a check up today and was told fixing this decay could lead to a root canal with it being close to the pulp. I am booked in for the filling and once she has opened it up, she will let me know if a root canal is needed. Do you agree that this is a possibility with where the decay is?\nI had an xray in Jan (left) where the shadow can be seen but it was never mentioned. Dr M: There is a high likelihood that this might end up in a root canal. The only way to know for sure is to remove all active decay. Judging by the earlier x-ray, the situation seems more or less like it would have been the same.\nKeep in mind, that even if the x-ray does not involve the nerve, any filling extremely close to the nerve, might irritate the nerve and then eventually lead to a root canal, even if it is a few years down the line. daintybow88: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThere is a high likelihood that this might end up in a root canal.

Thank you for your reply. Fingers crossed the filling will be okay. I am not in any pain so do you think it isn't too close to the nerve? I have read all sorts of negative things about Root Canal like it leading to disease else where in the body and it has scared me some what! Please do you have any reassurance on this? Dr M: If you don't have any symptoms, it is a good sign. A root canal might be avoided altogether, but again, the only way to know for sure is by cleaning out all the decay.\n\nRoot canal therapy is a time tested, well documented procedure in scientific peer-reviewed journals. A lot of recent social media posts, including some Netflix series, have put root canal therapies in a bad light. Most, if not all, of this misinformation is not based on any scientific consensus. There is a reason why this therapy is still taught as a standard of treatment in dental schools all over the world. daintybow88: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIf you don't have any symptoms, it is a good sign.

In other countries, people don't remove wisdom teeth as often, so this feels like something I should do if there are any concerns. Lower left tooth is sideways, so probably need to be removed, but unsure about others. Thoughts? Xray below. Dr M: Lower right wisdom tooth is partially impacted. This tooth creates a high risk of recurrent pericoronitis, and therefore the top + bottom teeth would need to be removed in my opinion. The left top wisdom tooth can also be removed and the lower left wisdom, only monitored for now, to ensure it doesn't cause any damage to the adjacent second molar.

The root treatment is the crowned tooth in the photo (tooth no 6) and the pain is from the tooth in front (no. 5). Dr M: It looks like the pain might be referred pain from the crown and root canal. On the side of the mesial root ( root closest to tooth no. 5), there appears to be some bone loss. This might be an indication of a periodontal abscess. This could happen if one of the roots of tooth no. 6 has a crack. Remember root canal teeth are dead teeth, and can still fracture over time, even if protected by a crown. I would suggest that you get a CBCT scan of this area. It would provide a 3D image of the area, and hopefully some more information about where the pain is coming from. alakuni: Discovering a bump on your gum can be an emotionally unsettling experience, and it's natural to feel concerned. You've already taken the right step by having an X-ray, which can provide valuable insights into the issue.\n\nThe good news is that a clear X-ray is reassuring, as it can rule out more serious problems like cysts or tumors. However, the presence of a bump on your gum may still need attention. It could be due to various factors, such as an infection, an injury, or a blocked saliva duct.\n\nIt's essential to consult with your dentist to determine the cause of the bump and explore appropriate treatment options. They can provide guidance and support to address the issue, alleviate your concerns, and ensure your gum health. Remember, your emotional well-being matters in this process, and seeking professional help is a positive step toward resolving the situation. smith26: Thanks for the reply and suggestion.

Is there some solution for this situation that doesn't require drilling or numbing? Like a cap or crown of gold? Looking for a very experienced dentist in Georgia. Dr M: If the nerve is indeed exposed or irreversibly inflamed, it might actually be an indication for a root canal treatment on the tooth. If you are pregnant, I would suggest seeing a dentist as soon as possible. The safest time for extensive dental treatment is during the 2nd trimester.

I asked to speak with the Dental Professional himself to ask more questions and he told me how much it would cost after insurance paid their share. He told me approximately $10,000.\n\nHe was very helpful and earned my trust more.\n\nI told him I live in poverty and I only have $0.33 left at the end of the month to buy groceries so I have to purchase groceries on credit.\n\nI also told him that I was able to scrounge up credit cards from family to pay for my care and if I could make payments to pay it off instead.\n\nHe told me that I need at least a $2,500 down payment if I wanted to make payments. I agreed to this down payment and he told me to come right this moment into his office to get it done.\n\nI went into the office and I told the receptionist that I would like to make a down payment. The dental professional came into the office and told me I had to sign up for their store credit card. I was lost and confused but I trust him so I signed up for their store credit card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SCAM RED FLAG #1 AND #2)\nI have a friend in sales and he told me that what the dental professional did was use a manipulative sales tactic called lowballing to get customers into the door to prime them to purchase a product.\nI also have a friend that works at a department store who told me that stores get a commission for every person that signs up for the store credit card regardless if the customer gets approved or not and that the dentistry is using their customers as cash cow to get paid every time a patient signs up for their store credit card. Now. I successfully signed up for a store card and he told me to come back after telling me that I could get the work done this day. (He just wanted me to sign up for a store credit card so his store could make $). But I demanded that he serviced me this same day as he said he would. I had to argue with him but I got it.\n\nI asked him how many teeth am I going to get pulled out today. He said 7. I don't know much about dentistry but I assumed this to be normal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SCAM RED FLAG #3)\nI have a friend who works in dentistry who told me normally patients would take out 1 or 2 max teeth at a time due to the pain involved and that he was just trying to fast track my procedure so he can farm other patients as cash cows. Next he told me to come back to pull the other teeth out. I asked him about my mercury fillings because I read on a blog that mercury fillings are a health hazard. He replied that he would be happy to take them out as well (without even inspecting them). He also tried to SELL me on taking out my impacted wisdom teeth when I never even mentioned them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SCAM RED FLAG #3)\nHe was trying to use me as a cash cow to milk my medi-cal health insurance with extra procedures that I did not need. Needless to say, he never took out my mercury teeth as he promised. \nAfter pulling out all the teeth that I was scheduled to remove. He made me make another appointment for a deep cleaning.\n\nIt was an absolute nightmare this experience.\n\nHe made his assistant come to help me after waiting for half an hour. His assistant asked me how I was doing and if I was ready for my dentures. I told her I did not receive my deep cleaning yet. She was confused because she was instructed by the dental professional to make a molding for my dentures. I had to argue with the dental assistant for up to an hour (why did I have to argue). I HAD to pull up my receipts to PROVE that I PAID for a deep cleaning which I NEVER received (why did I have to pull up my receipts)? Finally after much headache and arguing I was able to receive my deep cleaning from the dental professional and lets just say he wasn't happy because he was not gentle at all and I told him it was hurting and he replied, \"I know,\" and pressed harder. Idiot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SCAM RED FLAG #4)\nHe tried to play me for a fool and tried to pull a quick one on me by skipping out on my deep cleaning. GOOD thing I KEPT my receipts or I would've never received my deep cleaning. \nAFTER my deep cleaning was done, the dental professional told me to go make another appointment. I didn't ask what for because I trusted him and he seemed very cool so I went to the receptionist to make another appointment. The receptionist seemed VERY confused and asked me what it was for? I replied that I do not know and I was just following the health care dental professional instructions for making another appointment. They made me wait in the waiting room for an hour while they figured out what for. The dental professional finally replied that it was for another clean-up (after a deep clean though)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SCAM RED FLAG #5)\nMy friend who works in the dentist field told me that I DID NOT need another cleaning after a deep cleaning and that he was using me as a cash cow to milk my medi-cal government paid health insurance. SCAMMING IDIOT! I then went in for my denture moldings and during the process I kept telling him that this is hurting me and he kept replying, \"I know\" as he pressed harder. I figured it was just part of the routine so I stomached it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot a scam but just a sign of evil, piss-poor character and loose piss-poor morality. I was blinded by my own trust for health-care professionals. I thought all the bad guys are in hell and not on earth.\n\nI trusted him and he seemed trustworthy so I brought my mother(65/senior/disabled/female) to the office.\n\nThey took her x-ray and told her that they would call back in 2 weeks after contacting her government paid, medi-cal health insurance for coverage.

We’re both 26 years old, and 56 years old, respectively. This letter is in regards to her and her dental health.\n\nFor the past few decades, my mom’s dental health has been declining, rapidly. My mom has been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Arthritis, Herniated Disc Disease, and because of the intense amounts of pain she’s in, she has to take prescription opioids. One of the side effects that they have is that it dries her mouth out. She can’t brush her teeth, because of how sensitive her teeth and her nerves are.\n\nIt's been at least since 2020 since she’s seen a dentist. The reasoning behind it is because of not having enough money. It also doesn’t help that she has no dental coverage or insurance. In Washington State, she doesn’t qualify for Medicaid or any form of affordable dental coverage, because her income is apparently too high. As of 2023, she earns roughly $1,400 per month, on disability, and she spends over 90% on it on our rent. For me, I make about $940 a month, also on disability. We’ve tried looking into dental grants, but we have no luck. We’ve been phished, lied to, and nearly scammed, because of our income situation. We’ve spoken to a couple of orthodontists about her situation, and it would take around $55,000 for the medical procedure that she needs. This is money that neither of us have. This is money that none of our immediate family has.\n\nTo really see how bad her teeth are, here's a photo I took of her mouth, as best as I could:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the right side of her mouth is severely infected. The last tooth she got removed was one of her top incisors. Her bottom-left canine, pre-molars, and molars are the most infected. The right side of her mouth isn’t as bad, but it’s getting there. In the end, she just wants all of her teeth removed and to either have implants or removable dentures. Because of how bad her teeth are, it’s affected her mental and physical health.\n\nBecause of her teeth, she doesn’t like going outside in the condition she’s in. She’s very self-conscious about her face. It’s also getting harder for her to eat and chew foods. The only type of medical care she can do, is take more pain killers or NSAIDS for pain, or she has to keep going back to the urgent care and get antibiotics. She can’t do that forever, because she is a carrier for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Often, she breaks down because she doesn’t know about her financial options, what to do, where to go, or who to talk to. Meanwhile, I’m in college still, trying to get my degree. I can’t get a job just yet, because I’ve tried holding down a job and do school, but it took a massive toll on my mental health.\n\nWe have no one else to turn to, in terms of asking for help with getting dental grants, and for getting my mom’s teeth out. Please help us out, in any ways that you can. I don’t want my mom to die of septicemia, because I have nowhere to go, should that happen.\n\nPlease, if there's anything you can do to help us out or any resources you can think of, please message me/let us know.

Dr M: I am not familiar with the term '' gum paint '' however, during a scaling, calculus comes off from the tooth surface. Beneath those areas of calculus, the enamel sometimes becomes demineralized, and can then chip or cave in, forming an area you can feel with the tongue. Sometimes these areas, if big enough, require fillings.\nHowever,the photo is not clear and it could also be cingulum protrusions on the specific teeth, which is a normal enamel formation. parthipan: that makes sense, thank you for the reply : )"

I did not have any pain it just felt a little weird to smile.\n\nI did a salt water rinse in an attempt to reduce the swelling and wait it out to see it if went down. Later in the day I took some painkillers for a separate issue but I noticed by the evening that the swelling had reduced to just being above one tooth.\n\nSince the swelling has stayed around the same same size still with no pain as it is but the same feeling when I smile. It is tender/minimal pain to touch. This morning I went floss between the tooth it’s above and my gym started bleeding.\n\nOne of the teeth I had a filling on about a month and a half ago and I’m unsure if this is related.

Are these both cavities or is that just how that tooth looks. Dr M: Might only be a discolored pit. To rule out a cavity, an x-ray is needed or a clinical examination in order to determine if the pit is sticky or not. alakuni: Cavities, also known as dental caries or tooth decay, are more than just holes in your teeth. They can be a source of frustration and worry. Cavities develop when bacteria in your mouth produce acids that eat away at your tooth's protective enamel. This process can be emotionally distressing because it not only causes pain and sensitivity but also affects your self-esteem.\n\nThe emotional aspect of cavities is real – the fear of dental visits, the discomfort of eating, and the anxiety about how it might impact your smile and overall health. The good news is that with proper oral care, regular dental check-ups, and timely treatment, cavities can be prevented and managed.\n\nCaring for your oral health goes beyond just the physical; it's about preserving your confidence and well-being.

I was away on a trip however. \n\nThe dentist then said they had spoken with the lab, and a new mold was no longer required. \n\nI said that I could fly back to have the mold done again if this would help to ensure the crown would fit correctly, the dentist said no need.\n\nWhen it came time to fit the crown, it needed to be shaved down a lot in order to allow me to close my mouth.\n\nThe dentist was very defensive and hostile in response to any questions I had (very unprofessional), and very heavy handed with the procedure.\n\nI went to a second dental practice to get a second opinion.

It's totally justifiable that you may be feeling baffled, frustrated, or even restless about this present circumstance.\n\nOn the off chance that you accept that you are qualified for a discount for dental work, opening an exchange with your dental provider is fundamental. Begin by examining your interests and the explanations behind looking for a discount. Clear and fair openness is of the utmost importance for tracking down a goal.\n\nRecollect that your dental wellbeing and your monetary interest in it are critical.

This is because one of the main purposes of baby teeth is space maintenance and to assist in guiding the eruption of the permanent tooth.\nThis might then result in an orthodontic issue at a later stage. As for the gum line in comparison to the neighboring teeth-you will have to wait and see until the permanent incisor erupts. Gingival margins can be be adjusted, but only at a later age preferably.\nMost likely there won't be any major issues, although there are risks. You will just have to wait and see.

Thanks in advance honestdoc: I'm not from the UK.  Please tell me as much detail about your pain/problem. Dr M: Good day\n\nCarbamazepine is often prescribed for neuralgias. If the tooth that was extracted was a difficult extraction or a surgical extraction, there is a chance that the nerve could have been damaged during the procedure, or even during the administration of the local anaesthetic.\nThe pain that you are experiencing now-is it related to another specific tooth or just a generalized dull, burning or tingling pain?\nI have had cases where the nerve did get an injury, and then I also prescribed Carbamazepine in order to help with the \" nerve pain\" , but in most cases what is needed is time. A nerve injury, if not permanent, can sometimes take months or even a year to heal fully again, as the fibres regenerate. rach.atkinson: The extraction was a simple one and there were no problem. It’s a dull pain but gets sharper every now and again. I can feel it on the back tooth , the extraction site (the one in front ) and the tooth in front of that one . rach.atkinson: Had tooth pain in October/ November last year went to dentist had a failed root canal so they took the tooth out . I’m a slow healer my dentist says as the extraction sites have always healed slowly. A few weeks after there was pain that I told them was my back tooth. Had numerous appointments to alter my bite. Paid for a mouth guard for sleeping . Things improved for a few days then this pain kept coming back. Had x rays in the dentist and was sent to the hospital and none of the dentists could see anything wrong on the x rays lve Exhausted all options with the dentist . I’m on a referral waiting list but it’s looking like 16-18 weeks. Dentist has prescribed me a dose of 100mg carbamazepine to take once a day and she will review . I’ve just taken my first tablet Dr M: It might also be that one of the other teeth might have a crack and then a CBCT scan might be the only way to possibly see it, since conventional x-rays won't reveal a crack in all instances. Have you been taking any anti-inflammatory medication? \nIt is possible that an occlusal adjustment might have been needed, but if there was no real relief, further investigation might be needed? Have you been referred to a specialist of any kind? rach.atkinson: Yes I’ve been referred to a dental hospital in Leeds. I’ve had one of the scans that move around your head is that a CBCT scan.

Will the small hole/air pocket that is in my temporary crown affect my permanent crown because it is a pain MattKW: It usually won't be a problem for your permanent crown as the permanent crown material can be thinner and stronger.

Thickness is easily measured with calipers.\nWe can't give you permanent crowns with holes. sendicott: What does it mean by under prepared? Do they need to see if they can take more of the tooth off?

MattKW: The temporary crown gives a rough guide as to the likely thickness of the final permanent crown. \nWhen the permanent crown is tried in for fit, then any adjustments are made before cementing. The thickness of the permanent crown must be correct before cementing - if too thin, then more tooth needs to be removed, a new impression taken, a new temp crown made, and a new permanent crown made.

I am 73 and read that complications are more likely at my age, though the dentist says age doesn't matter. My fear of having it pulled, and the expense, is causing me to procrastinate, but would waiting put me at high risk of future problems?

    "dialogue": "Georgeden: I've noticed a strange growth between my cheek and tooth. I've had it for several months; initially, I thought it was a natural structure, but I've begun to feel it more and more. I don't have it on the other side of my jaw.\n\nWhen I touch it with my finger, I don't feel any pain. However, I often perceive it as a bubble in my mouth, feeling it with my lips closed.\n\nUnfortunately, I regularly feel discomfort in that area after eating something hard, like M&Ms, or foods that require strong chewing. After such an injury, the area can hurt for several days. The tooth in that area doesn't bother me, and I can bite down on it.\n\nWhat could it be? Some time ago (about 16 months), I used a lot of mouthwashes and tooth applications from the pharmacy containing ethanol. I had toothaches back then, and it provided some temporary relief.\n\nI'm afraid that because of this, I might now have a serious issue or gum cancer. MattKW: That is simply the buccal frenum (elastic and striated muscle fibers). You will have one on the opposite side."

    "title": "Possible Lingual/Inferior Alveolar Nerve damage which has led to Trigeminal Neuralgia",
    "dialogue": "S3B: Good afternoon everyone (I am from South Africa, so excuse the time difference for those experiencing it),\n\nI am new to the forums, and you can call me Seb. I am just here to enquire about some recent dental issues I have encountered which has left me in a state of chronic pain. I will get into details a bit later, considering I first just want to get to the bottom of the situation.\n\nI'm suspecting I might have sustained damage to my the Lingual/Inferior Alveolar Nerve on the right side of my face (my perspective) which might have led to a condition referred to as Trigemnal Neuralgia (TN), commonly known as \"Suicide Disease\". I'd like to enquire about the necessary steps I'm supposed to follow in case I had an injury to any of the nerves which might contribute to said condition. Who do I see to determine if this is in fact nerve damage; a Neurologist or Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon? Are there tests they can run to ascertain 100% if I have indeed sustained a nerve injury? Would you be able to PHYSICALLY SEE this perhaps?\n\nI have already gone back to the dentist, but she told me to wait 2 weeks and has put me on Celebrex 200 for the time being. Can this potentially heal over time, or am I screwed for life? I know in some cases, nerve damage can be permanent. My pain is EXCRUCIATING, and it doesn't stop (which has me worried, and is the main reason I came to this forum). It's like a stinging/aching pain, and it feels like it's in the back of my mouth behind the 3rd molar where the dentist injected me (x3 times, due to not anesthetizing easily). I don't think it's the tooth that had to get an inlay that's causing the problem (this tooth seems fine now). It almost feels like I'm still getting injected, or alternately, stabbed in the nerves in the back of my mouth.\n\nPLEASE, if anyone can help me, it would be much appreciated, even if people can link me to other threads. I am in a state of constant chronic pain and I haven't been able to function normally. I have even cried a couple of times, up to the point where I am not even able to cry anymore. This is really a SERIOUS issue to me. Any help would be MUCH appreciated.\n\nThanks you in advance.\n\nRegards,\nSeb\n\nP.S. A GP has also put me on Panafcort (Prednisone) 5 mg x 24. I was supposed to take 12 this past Thursday after I had just seen the GP, and then another 12 yesterday (Friday), 24 hours later. I haven't taken ANY thus far, considering I am doubtful when it comes to Prednisone and cortico-steroids (I have been on them before and suspect they might've contributed to my lower-immunology and persistent allergy (Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria). Is it a bad decision abstaining from what the doctor's recommended if I'm doubtful? Busybee: I'm very sorry that you are in so much pain.  I had transient Trigeminal neuralgia years ago.  It was very distressing but in my case I'd get random shooting pain and I would not have any warning of when.   It went after three or four months but I would panic if I didn't have painkillers with me.  I think mine was caused by a too high nightguard and possibly also a whiplash injury a couple of years earlier.   I was helped by nurofen codeine tablets.   Cortico steroids do have side effects in some people.  In my case they make me fall asleep.   I've needed them for a severe allergy.   It's good to know exactly what's happening before taking something so strong on a regular basis.  Have you tried any regular painkillers?  \n\nWhat dental work did you have just before this started? MattKW: If this pain started up after recent treatment, that is the logical place to start before getting into more obscure diagnoses like TN. \"If you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras.\" If your dentist can't define the pain, then go to an endodontist to rule out tooth pain. They will then guide you elsewhere if necessary. S3B: Hi again,\n\nThanks so much for the feedback everyone, I really appreciate it.\n\nI'm trying to keep this as short as possible for the time being, for the sake of brevity, and will get into the more finer details a bit later if necessary.\n\nJust to some things up quickly: I recently had work done x2 on my 1st molar on the right hand side of my lower jaw (mandible) from my perspective. Both were inlays done by 2 different dentists. The 1st dentist's inlay I didn't like (my bite was screwed up), while the 2nd one did a good job, except for the pain I now have in my mandible close to where she injected me and worked on the tooth. This pain only came after I saw the 2nd dentist who did a good job with the 2nd inlay.\n\nThe 1st doctor who did a bad job gave me x2 injections, while the 2nd doctor who did a good job gave me x3 injections (both due to the fact that I don't anesthetize easily). Personally, I think I should wait a bit longer with regards to injections (maybe a bit longer than the average person actually), because my reaction time seems slow (i.e. maybe we can do away with 1 shot only, but we must just wait for long enough, or at least a little longer than average). Maybe I feel like we DIDN'T wait long enough, and possibly overdosed on injections.\n\nWhat are the chances that I might have suffered needle injury due to having had TOO many dental injections in the same region in a short time-spain? Could this have damaged a nerve perhaps? Could the anesthetic have played a role? I also hear a weird clicking/crunching sound more or less where the pain is felt when I bite up and down properly. This doesn't sound like it's my jaw's bones, but more like it could be tissue (flesh) damage. Could this also potentially indicate nerve damage? This is what originally got me worried: the pain and the sound, originating from the same area.\n\nThe pain seems less now, but it's still there. It's lingering, and I feel it most of the time and it's hard NOT to focus on it. It's almost like a new permanent sensation my jaw has now. I am however still on the painkillers.\n\nI'd like to find out what steps I should take in case of needle injury/trauma, stiff painful jaw and this weird sound I'm hearing when I'm biting up or down. Am I overreacting? I'm scared I ignore this/don't treat it right in time/don't see the right doctor in time and end up with permanent long term problems.\n\nIs there anything I can do in the meantime at home to help with the recovery process (apart from drinking painkillers, trying to eat healthy and maintaining good oral hygiene).\n\nAny help/tips would go a long way toward putting my mind (and hopefully pain) at ease.\n\nThank you. Busybee: How long ago was the treatment? MattKW: Nerve damage from routine injections does not match with your problems. At most, if the nerve has been pranged (unlikely), then you may have transient numbness for several days, just like bruising.It is actually quite difficult to directly hit the Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) as it is tucked away behind a spur of bone. I might get it once every 3-6 months, and the patient gets an immediate electric shock to the lip.\n\nLocal anaesthetic is also extremely safe. There must be billions of LA injections every year in dental and medical situations. To overdose would take a huge amount, at least 30mL in a very short time, and I've heard of doses higher without ill effect. Most dental cartridges contain about 2 mL. The first signs will be agitation.\n\nEvery dental injection causes some muscle damage, and the occasional trismus afterwards can happen rarely. It will settle.\n\nIf you have your mouth open for a long time, this can upset the jaw function and give TMD symptoms. Resolution is aimed at palliative care by limiting your opening when eating or yawning. These things settle down in most cases. If you're going in for a long dental session, ask for a bite block.\nAgain, I would be looking at the tooth that was recently filled for the primary source of pain. S3B: Dear MattKW,\n\nThanks so much for your input, it really means a lot. I'll try give it some time and be a bit more patient. It's just that I've never experienced lingering pain for so long, so it's got me all worried and upset. In the past when they'd worked on this tooth, it seemed fine within 2-3 days.\n\nI have however done some research which has indicated that people can hit the lingual nerve (very rarely) when doing injections, but it is quite a rare incident (some also mention the inferior alveolar nerve being a potential target). People also react differently to the anesthetics used (e.g. Novacaine, Lidocaine etc.). Also, there was another article I skimped through which advised against injecting repeatedly. I'll link it when I have some more time.\n\nI would however like to establish the following: if something went wrong during the injection, how can you exactly pick it up? I'm assuming it's not that easy finding out where the needle went, and what it might've hit? There aren't tests they can do to evaluate this? Like let's say for instance someone wants to take a look at their nerves and if they were in fact damaged/bruised, could you pick this up with any testing? Also, which doctor should you be consulting?\n\nLastly, if this was in fact just standard post-op needle bruising, is there anything I could do to speed up/improve/maximize recovery perhaps?\n\nPlease let me know if you've got any additional tips/recommendations. MattKW: Quite the opposite. The lingual nerve is shallower than the IAN, and is easily struck; I probably hit it 1 in 5 injections, and this gives an electric shock feeling to the tongue. You just pull the needle back and reinsert slightly to the side. \nPeople don't react differently to different LA solutions. The only difference is that most contain adrenaline to make it work better. This will often give people a few heart jitters because the injection, being close to a nerve, is also close to veins and arteries. If it really annoys people, I give them a plain solution. All dentists probably carry at least 1 LA without adrenaline.\nThe degree of damage is determined externally by testing the residual amount of numbness to the face. Simply from needle trauma, I've never had to do this because it will resolve within a few days. It is only in cases where there has been serious damage to the nerve like after surgical extraction of wisdom teeth where closer monitoring is required. \nYou can't change the rate of healing. Like any bruise, it can take up to 2 weeks. honestdoc: Dr. MattKW is right.   Nerve damage results in feeling numb afterwards.  Your mouth recovers very quickly after injections.  Like Dr. MattKW says, you can't change the rate of healing but you can try corticosteroids to minimize excessive inflammation (you had previously mentioned abstaining from).  With the type of stabbing, stinging pain you are experiencing, hopefully a neurologist may be able to help or manage it. S3B: I think a Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon would be the better option if I'm REALLY worried about persistent pain, especially considering it's in my jaw (lower) where the pain is localized, and that's what they specialise in (apart from the fact that they've studied dentistry as well, unlike Neurologists). Wouldn't they be more qualified in dealing with LN and IAN injuries/problems resulting from dentistry, than say a Neurologist?\n\nI know you guys think I'm over-reacting, but the pain comes up more stronger than usual every now and then (in fact, it just came back stronger just now (this afternoon) than it was this morning; maybe my painkillers have worn off). Also, the fact that I'm obsessing about it due to the level of pain and and it's persistence has me worried. I'm just scared it never goes away, and I need to figure out what the next steps I should take, would be. I was thinking this would be nerve pain if it wasn't general post-dental injection pain. Unless this is tooth-ache. But the type of pain is like stinging/biting/zapping/aching, so I'm scared it might be more than just regular post-dental healing pain. It's also hard to localize it exactly.\n\nI'm going to wait till the end of this week and keep on taking my painkillers as described and then take things from there. I've found out about doctors in my local area specializing in these types of conditions. S3B: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow long ago was the treatment? It took place on the 19th of October 2018, so I'm going on my 3rd week now actually. This is why I have become a tad worried... Busybee: S3B said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIt took place on the 19th of October 2018, so I'm going on my 3rd week now actually. This is why I have become a tad worried... \nAfter dental treatment I would give it three months before worrying.   The worrying helps nobody and just makes you more anxious every time the pain happens.  You've had one lot of treatment after another so it could just be your body reacting and your jaw trying to adjust to a different bite.  It may be your nerve has been irritated but nerves tend to calm down over time.  The time it takes varies with each individual.  \n\nI'd also suggest ibuprofen first.   Corticosteroids are serious meds and should not be taken if you can find relief using alternative medication.   You should not take them long term.   I found relief using an ibuprofen codeine tablet.  These can be highly addictive, but they have fewer side effects than Prednisolone.     Either way you should protect your digestive system.  It took three months for my shooting pains to go.   In my experience pain can be at its worst just before it stops for good.  \n\nThe neurologist will likely tell you that it should settle.  There is little they can do other than try to diagnose and refer you for pain management.   It's worth trying different things such as a biteguard to see whether you have pain relief when the jaw is relaxed, MattKW: I DO wish that you would see an endodontist first to make sure you rule out a toothache-related pain. I've had a few patients who have gone to neurologists who were found later to have had a toothache. That's after they've usually been drugged with Lyrica and Tegretol in a simplistic bombarding to try and control the pain. If you do end up at a neurologist in the end, they're going to feel more secure knowing you've completely eliminated the dental possibilities. Your problems began after dental fillings; the injections have nothing to do with it as I've already detailed. MattKW: Thank you, honestdoc. Apart from my joke about zebras, I also like to espouse the KISS principle, \"Keep It Simple Stupid\". S3B: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI DO wish that you would see an endodontist first to make sure you rule out a toothache-related pain.

Just keep in mind that I'm reacting like this because of unexpected long-duration pain after recent dentistry. I've never had pain for this long, which has led to my incessant worry.\n\nAlso, people can hit your your nerves with common injections during routine dental visits, with pretty bad consequences as well. I'm sure this doesn't happen too often, but unfortunately, it can:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm assuming dentists are VERY aware and VERY WELL COVERED regarding the aforementioned.

It's worth trying different things such as a biteguard to see whether you have pain relief when the jaw is relaxed, I'm giving it between 4-8 weeks (going on my third now). From what I can gather, if someone did in fact hit a nerve, this is the time-span it'll take to heal naturally by itself (unless there's been permanent damage). After this time-span I guess you can look at further investigation. I am still taking a Celebrex 200 during the morning and evenings (2 in total per day), but I've stopped with the Mypaid forte pills for now which are anti-inflammatory and pain relieving (containing 400 mg Ibuprofen and 325 mg Paracetamol). I've been told to not take this for too long a period, 'cause it's bad for your stomach apparently (is that why you mentioned the 'digestive system'?). Do you rate taking both these at the same time would be a bad idea?\n\nAlso, I already have a retainer/biteguard. I don't always know how much it helps with my grinding; I think this tooth of mine is pretty f*cked (excuse my language) from taking the brunt of the 'grind', so to speak. I'm considering looking at other alternatives. I have very bad anxiety, and I think it's only getting worse, which has contributed TOO negatively to my bruxism (grinding). I live a very stress-filled life at the moment I'm afraid. S3B: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDr. MattKW is right.   Nerve damage results in feeling numb afterwards.

Panafcort (Prednisone) 5 mg x 24 is what I've been prescribed, where I need to take 12 on one day, and then 24 hours later another 12 (which I haven't done as of yet). It's not a long duration for taking Prednisone, which they usually advise against (some people say long term use can have disastrous effects, especially once you try to get off of it again (I'm talking about people that have to take it regularly, as prescribed). I'm just paranoid about taking it because I'm scared said drug might've contributed to my dip in general health (I recently became very allergic and now suffer from Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria), and if I'm not mistaken, I had this drug along with penicillin round about the same time my allergies started. I am thus hesitant/dubious when it comes to taking Prednisone. Just look at all the bad rap people give it when you Google it.\n\nI know it helps with inflammation however, but I also know it inhibits your immune system. I'm scared of doing that when I'm recovering from dental pain/injuries. I don't know how much I like the idea of HOLDING MY IMMUNE SYSTEM BACK in order to reduce inflammation. Isn't the inflammation a sign of healing/recovery? Why would you want to curb that? Isn't inflammation a 'natural sign of recovery' that should be left to sort itself out? I'm scared it leads to 'impaired' healing which might yield even longer term issues.\n\nHow often do they prescribe Prednisone in dentistry for post dental pain/injury/inflammation? Do you perhaps know? MattKW: That video is so mixed up and misleading, I'm insulted by it. But,... that's the internet. Everyone gets a soapbox.\n\nHe talks that he was injected into the lingual nerve. No, we don't do that because we are passing BY the lingual nerve. We may skewer it on the way if we totally ignore the screaming patient. I don't think any patient would let me do that. We pull back and redirect.\n\nHe talks of prolonged anaesthesia of not just the lingual nerve but also the IAN (tongue, and lip). What, they were both skewered in the same injection? That IAN is hard to hit directly at the best of times. \n\nWe don't aim blindly. The lingual nerve is ~1cm deep, the IAN is ~2.5cm deep. We can't see them, but there are bony and tissue landmarks which guide us. There are a few techniques for aiming at the IAN, but they all have pros and cons.\n\nHe confuses 3% prilocaine with 4% articaine. It was articaine that raised some concern following a Danish study which has since been discredited. Usage of articaine here in Australia was behind that in Europe and USA, but has become very popular for certain reasons. There has been no increase in lingual nerve damage.\nI have no idea what happened to this poor fellow, but LA is not matching up. There have been cases of dentists reusing empty dental cartridges for other solutions and getting them mixed up - can't imagine anyone being that idiotic anymore, but maybe....?\nHe makes it sound as if dentists have the lawyers on side. No, we can't be found negligent unless we have stepped outside the normal procedures (like reusing cartridges). Maybe this fellow should try dental treatment without LA in future. Or maybe just brush his teeth. honestdoc: S3B said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPanafcort (Prednisone) 5 mg x 24 is what I've been prescribed, where I need to take 12 on one day, and then 24 hours later another 12 (which I haven't done as of yet).

Do you perhaps know? You are right to be concerned with corticosteroids like Prednisone.  I don't prescribe it often and only as a Dose Pack for 7 days.  It is more effective Anti-inflammatory agent than Non Steroids like Ibuprofen. Busybee: Prenisolone does suppress the immune system S3B.  They give it to me when I have an allergic reaction.    I don't think my body would tolerate it on any regular basis.  It is really strong and works great on reversing anaphylaxis but I'd never consider taking it for pain.   I am sensitive to various meds and this is one of them.    You really should get a proper diagnosis before taking prescription meds.  You shouldn't take prednisolone and ibuprofen at the same time.   The dose you mention is similar to what I've been given for allergic shock.  \n\nI've taken paracetamol at the same time as ibuprofen.  It works but I cannot recommend it as I'm sure it's not great for your body to do that too often.   I find codeine is a great painkiller but as mentioned there's a risk of addiction particularly if you have chronic pain.   \n\nYou should always try to reduce inflammation to promote healing.   For example I'm sure you've heard of RICE for sprain injuries.  (rest, ice, compression, elevation), most of that relates to reducing inflammation.  Inflammation may be a natural reaction to protect the area and promote healing in the first instance, but it also damages tissues over time, may cause scar tissue and causes pain."

    "dialogue": "larryjoe: I haven't went to the dentist in years. Yes that is on me. I was planning to go to one soon in a few weeks to get cleaning done... most likely deep cleaning as I haven't had one in years. Recently, I notice that in between two of my bottom teeth, not the middle ones but a bit to the right of it... there is like this inflamed pimple that is there. When I went to brush it with my toothbrush, I then notice blood coming out of it. Now the last few weeks when I been brushing my teeth, I been very lazy not brushing all the areas of it. Also I been eating a lot of junk food and crunching food in that area of my teeth so that could be a cause? I also haven't been eating healthy as well lately.\n\n\n\nAfter that, I then put in some mouthwash and rinsed and spit it out. Then the next day, did the same thing. Now the pain is not as bad as it before that. However, that thing is still there and looks inflamed and swollen? It is literally like a red inflamed spot right between two of my bottom teeth.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone know if this is for sure a periodonal abscess? I had read of swollen gums and gingivitis and at first I thought it was swollen gums but could this be a periodonal abscess? If I post a picture, could one tell what it is? The thing is I only been brushing teeth with toothbrush and using listerine mouthwash. I also boiled water with salt and rinsed a bit with that but only did it once. I read listerine and boiled water with salt is good. So if it is swollen gum or gingivitus, then it can clear up on it's own?\n\n\n\nI had planned to go to the dentist in a few weeks or next month but when this happened recently, I thought if I go there now, they would give me some antibiotics and then I would come back in few weeks to get a cleaning done so I figure I should let this heal on it's own? Or because I'm not sure what it is... I should go to a dentist and have it looked at? I read if it is periodonal abscess, it needs to be drained? At the moment, it is still there and can feel it with my inner tongue when moving my tongue but there isn't noticeable pain... but a bit of discomfort if you touch it with the tongue.\n\n\n\nHas anyone had this before? Thanks. larryjoe: Okay so it seems like the dentist would have to do a procedure on you then if you have periodonal abscess no matter what or not?\n\n\nI noticed this days ago and just recently when I went to brush my teeth with electric toothbrush and brushed that area... it started bleeding again.  But this is with an electric toothbrush so it is harsher than a regular toothbrush.  \n\n\nBut if not brushing it or anything, there is little to no pain at all.  What am I suppose to do here? larryjoe: Hi would like your feedback or other people feedback on this. Went to dentist and he had me go get an x ray done. He then said we going to do deep cleaning on all 4 quadrants of the teeth. On the first visit, he did that and got rid of that periodonal abscess. He tells me it isn't in the tooth but the gum area? He said nothing else need to be done. I said I read online that if you have periodonal abscess, you either get the tooth removed or a root canal. He says it is not necessary. He says my periodonal abscess was not minor but also not serious but in the middle. He said nothing is necessary.\n\n\nI then went to get the 2nd deep cleaning done in another quadrant of my teeth and he says it is fine.\n\n\nHave you or anyone heard about this? He says I just have to do 2 more deep cleanings in the other 2 quadrants and that is all.\n\n Quote lancerollins  Reply larryjoe: Does anyone have feedback on this?  Moderator... it still shows my last post is awaiting for moderator approval."

It happens randomly during the day. Whether I've been active or just sitting makes no difference... Whether I've just eaten or drank or not makes no difference. It's like a tiny person just decides to pluck at the nerve whenever they want. Is it normal & Why is this is happening? Is something stimulating the nerve itself to twinge or twang or is it Just my brain prompting the nerve to suddenly act out then stop?

    "title": "Root canal treatment ongoing for more than 6 months.",
    "dialogue": "Ktulu: Hi.\nFor more than half a year now, one of my lower premolar is giving me troubles.\nIt was cleaned and applyed fillings with medication for countles times since.\nThe doctor subscribed antibiotics, anti-inflamatory for a couple of times without results.\nHe tried numerous \"medications\" and some \"disinfectants\" as he calls them in temporary fillings. One of this disinfectant (about 1 month ago) made a slight change. That evening I felt some very sharp, stabbing pains, like lightning strikes. They lasted only fractions of a second, repeating every ~5-10 minutes. This went on for 2-3 hours than stopped.\nSince than the tooth is slightly better, but far from good.\nEvery time the doctor cleanes the root canal (once a week) and changes the medication, it gets much worse for a couple of days. I guess from the stabbings while cleaning the tip of the root canal. However he's using an apex locator tablet-thingy. (Last time i saw some red coloration on the absorbant paper point he was using)\nEspecially during the night and in the morning, I feel the tooth being high and very sensitive. Even to slight touch, slight pressure, sideways movement etc.\nLater in the day it becomes less sensitive, I can eat softer food. \nI've also noticed, that stickyer food, (similar to chewing gum) that pulls on to the filling is painful.\nWhat is your opinion, what should I do?\nI feel like the doctor has ran out of ideas and medications to try. The nurse sometimes loudly laughs at me in the background when I arrive and tell the doctor that again nothing has changed.\nThank you.\n\n(the x-ray was made 2 months ago) Dr M: I would suggest maybe seeking a second opinion in a case like this. It is not normal to have the 1st phase of a root canal to be done over several months. I would also suggest taking a CBCT scan in order to rule out additional canals or cracks in the tooth. Ktulu: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI would suggest maybe seeking a second opinion in a case like this. It is not normal to have the 1st phase of a root canal to be done over several months. I would also suggest taking a CBCT scan in order to rule out additional canals or cracks in the tooth. Thank you.\nI forgot to tell, that I always feel pain when the doctor reaches the  bottom of the root canal while cleaning it. Especially when he uses the absorbant paper points to dry it out.\nIs this normal? Dr M: Could be chronic infection. Difficult to say for sure. I would still suggest more advanced radiography in a case like this with a second opinion. Ktulu: Eventually I went for a second opinion. The doctor wanted a new x-ray. I asked if I should bring a CBCT for more detail, but he asked for a regular one. See attachment.\nHe thinks the first doctor performed the root canal washings incorrectly, and the fluid exited the canal around the tip.\nHe now changed the temporary filling to Calcium 2 weeks ago. I should return in a week.\nIt helped maybe a little, but it still has the sensitivity to bite and lateral push. Especially in the morning.\nDoctor sais, there is nothing more to do, but maybe a permanent filling, and if more problems arise, it needs to be extracted.\nMy question is, could it be left the canal open, or with temporary filling/cotton/medication, and the exterior closed with some harder filling that would last 5-6 months? And changed every now and then?\nOr any other solution?\nHalf of the crown is missing, so curently a temporary filling only lasts around 1,5 month.\n\nThank you. Ktulu: Dr M, what do you think? MattKW: A CBCT - up to 18% of lower premolars have a 2nd canal. And there could be lateral branches from main canal or bifurcation at apex.\nAlso, there should be no bleeding unless the apical constriction has been breached; very unusual.\nYou feel pain when the paper point is inserted? Are you having the dressings changed without LA? Ktulu: Yes, I feel pain when the paper point is inserted. Last time when the Dr. filled the canal with calcium, he explicitly asked me to signal when I feel a stabbing pain. And I felt a pretty sharp and strong pain. Than he stopped. \nHe told me, that it is even better if the calcium exits the apex into the surrounding area.\nHe also said that the canal is already very wide. If I'm correct, he used a size 60 needle? He mentioned that this rarely happens.\nYes, I never ask for any type of anesthesia.\nAren't lateral branches from main canal visible (if they exist) on the x-rays I've posted?\nI should mention that there are days when it feels much worse. Very sensitive. When I do some cardio, I feel pressure or even pulsating feeling.\nThank you. MattKW: It's not better if the CaOH exits the apex; sure, it can go up to the apex, but not be forced beyond that point. So he packs it in until you feel pain? - an interesting technique.\nSize 60 is very large. This and the idea of pushing CaOH beyond the apex suggests that there is no natural apical constriction anymore. Not ideal - it makes success a bit harder, but still possible.\nYou won't see lateral canals on a standard Xray. John Morgens: It sounds like you've been experiencing persistent pain and discomfort with your lower premolar despite multiple attempts at treatment. Here are a few steps you could consider taking:\n\nSeek a Second Opinion: If you feel that your current dentist has exhausted their options and you're not getting relief, it might be a good idea to seek a second opinion from another dentist or an endodontist (a specialist in root canal treatments). They might offer fresh insights or approaches to resolving your issue.\n\nConsult a Specialist: An endodontist specializes in treating issues related to the inner structures of teeth, including root canals. Consulting with a specialist could provide you with more advanced treatment options and a higher level of expertise.\n\nImaging: If your current treatment isn't resolving the issue, your dentist might consider performing more advanced imaging, such as a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan, to get a clearer picture of the root canal system and the surrounding structures.\n\nPossible Re-Treatment: In some cases, a root canal treatment may need to be redone if there are persistent issues or if the infection wasn't completely resolved during the initial treatment.\n\nConsider Extraction: If all other options have been explored and the tooth continues to cause severe pain and problems, extraction might be considered as a last resort. In such cases, discussions about possible replacement options like dental implants or bridges could also be initiated.\n\nEffective Communication: It's important to maintain open communication with your dentist. If you feel that your concerns are not being taken seriously, you might want to express your frustrations and discuss your options. If the behavior of the nurse is affecting your confidence in the treatment, you should address this issue with the dentist as well.\n\nRemember, your oral health is a priority, and it's crucial to work closely with a dental professional to find a solution that addresses your pain and discomfort. Always consult with a qualified dentist or endodontist who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

I take about 30 mins before leaving home. take calming music & headphones. Wear really comfortable clothes. I have a friend whose dentists uses a blanket if patient want to use it.  Plan ahead of time for something comforting afterwards when you can eat or drink, warm tea, etc. take a nap afterwards if needed. All the extras are great , but what gets me in the dentist chair is Xanax. Hope this helps Katz: Darwin....... A really important thing I forgot to say is to make sure you tell your dentist if you take Xanax or something similar, dose amount, etc.  Btw, I had my baby teeth capped as a preschooler.

The tooth was very sensitive to the cold and hot and sweetness. But before the appointment the pain almost disappeared. I have been taking 3 ibuprofens in the evening to help ease the pain and it helped – apparently reduced the inflammation. I need to point out at night the pain started from somewhere near my upper check bone and then spread all over the upper part of my right jaw. It was rather horrible at times so I took diclofenac a few times to calm it down.\n\n\n\nThey took the xray which showed no inflammation on tooth top. They gave me a hefty altracaine doze which numbed my upper lips and upper cheeks and somewhat numbed the tooth. They started opening the tooth and it was a little bit painful at that time. But then when she approached the nerve cavity the pai just went through the roof!!! I have not been treated like this in all of my life (42). I asked to maybe kill the nerve with some medicine or put the painkiller directly into the canal – which she tried and which hurt strongly as well. Sending waves of pain through the right of my head. Then they waited ad tried to open the canal and when she opened it up it started bleeding – she tried to stop the bleeding and then managed to put some medicine and close the tooth with the temporary filling. Now I need to visit them the coming Thursday. I hate to even think of this. I have high blood pressure and do not want to go through this excruciating procedure ,let alone wait till they drill through the canal, which is very long and huge with a thick nerve inside!!\n\nShe said the tooth was not responding to altracaine because there was the inflammation inside the tooth itself. Can this be? Have I run into a wall of the medical dental science here which cannot make it painless???? Can you now just kill the nerve before drilling it out???\n\n\n\nPlease help!"

In our practice, we use the lead apron on patients that are pregnant and it is absolutely indicated to take an x-ray. I would not worry if I were you. MattKW: They are not recommended at all in Australia anymore, even for pregnant women.

Apply a dab 2-3x daily after first brushing your teeth and try not to disturb for at least 30mins.

I've twice seen my dentist (and then checked with an endodontist who did a cone beam CT scan-- he just told me that the upper jawbone structure is sound) who said I should try an OTC prepare-it-yourself night guard. You see, the tooth really only slightly bothers me during sleep when it simply physically feels a bit strange or weird. I've looked at products at Amazon but tend to read only the 1 star reviews since I don't trust the 5 star ones. In the 1 star reviews, people complain that it's not so easy to drop the plastic form into boiling water, let it cool a bit and then bite down on it when one puts it in the mouth to make it fit the teeth. Some of these products seem lousy too and maybe will have a bad taste when used during sleep. Have any of you found an OTC product that is fairly easy to fit to one's teeth and which is durable and has no awful taste? Please state the name of it and where I might find it/buy it.   Thanks MattKW: Why wouldn't you get a dentist or prosthetist to make you a proper nightguard? As an experiment, I once bought a DIY whitening kit from the internet - you take your own impression with the putty and tray they supply, post it to them, and they send back the whitening tray and bleach. Even in my hands, there is no way I could make a decent impression.\nAs for a boil-and-bite, that's simply hopeless. You'll waste your money. music-fps: OK, thanks Matt for that info.\n\nYou see, I've never used any kind of tooth guard so I've no experience with these objects. Also, instead of directly getting a proper nightguard made by a dentist, I only wanted to see how these fit and if I might be able to make a useable OTC one that would feel good during sleep. I'm a light sleeper and also use a CPAP machine which employs a \"nose pillow\" (a thin, soft rubber item with 2 holes, one for each nostril) pushing up on me under my nose. I wondered that with the nightguard and the CPAP nose pillow, I'd have maybe poor sleep especially if the OTC prepare-it-yourself one might force my mouth open a bit. [I can't have my mouth open during sleep due to the nature of the airflow from the CPAP machine.] MattKW: Definitely don't bother with OTC night guard if you are using a CPAP; you won't be able to close your mouth."

If felt like she needed a therapist than a client. Needless to say, I didn’t go back.\n\n2) Dentist No.2 (May)\n\nMay 14, I visited another dentist. I told her about my other x-rays but she insisted she wanted to do her own and charged me $124. This time I needed only 17 filings. Hurray! She was very pleasant and knowledgeable, and I felt comfortable with her. Because I don’t have insurance (self-employed), she said she’d send me a 4 -phase treatment plan. She said it was important I do all the work within 6 months, so the condition of my teeth doesn’t get worse. She also advised to get started on Colgate PreviDent 5000 Plus Care Toothpaste to slow down decay. I bought it on my way home and got on it that night.\n\nMay 21, I went in for my first fillings appointment visit and they told me dentist 2 wasn’t in so another dentist would see me. This other dentist was nice too but fresh out of dental school. She filled 2 teeth. \n\nMy next appointment was 2 weeks later June 7, that was was cancelled too because dentist 2 was unavailable for 3 weeks. I was asked if I wanted to see the dentist I saw in my last visit and I said ok. So made appointment for June 14. I went in, waited 16 minutes, then she told me she would only do 1 tooth because she was running late with her appointments. Ok. I can relate.\n\nMade another appointment for June 21 when Dentist 2 was expected back. They called and cancelled 2 days before the appointment but asked if I was okay with seeing the dentist who'd be working on me. I really wanted to see dentist 2 because the dentist who was working on me kept saying to the dental assistant Dentist 2 is better at this and asking the dental assistant what dentist 2 does this or that. I was losing my confidence in her, but she was really pleasant and seemed to want to do a good job, and I liked her. Took 45 minutes to fill only 1 tooth though. \n\nMade another appointment for the following week July 3 but I had to cancel to fill in for a colleague who wasn't feeling well. I made another appointment for July 10 but it was pushed to July 15. Again, 45 minutes to fill only 1 tooth.\n\nI made another appointment for July 22 but at this point in time, we’d done 4 out of 17 teeth in 2.5 months, and I’m worried the condition of my teeth will get worse by the 6-month deadline. I decided I needed to transfer to another dental clinic and see if they could work on me faster.\n\n3) Dentist No.3 (July)\n\nWe made an appointment for July 27. I called the other clinic and cancelled the July 22 and told them why. I also told the new clinic I had x-rays done May 14, so they asked the other dental clinic to send the x-rays over. While we waited for the x-rays to be sent from the other clinic, the new dentist looked at my teeth, zeroed on the 3rs molar, and tapped it hard with some metal thing and asked if I felt pain. I said no. He asked if it was sensitive told cold or hot food. I said no. He asked if I had any pain, I said none at all. He said even if I felt no pain or sensitivity, I needed a root canal on my 3rd molar on the left side. Complete shock to me. No mention of root canal with my April 20 x-rays with dentist 1. No mention of a root canal with my May 14 with dentist 2 (her treatment plan didn’t have a root canal work).\n\nBefore the other x-rays came in, Dentist 3 did another x-ray of my 3rd molar on the left side and showed it to me. I had seen my previous x-rays blown up on a big TV screen above my head and this new x-ray on a computer screen looked so bad all the way to the root. I wondered how dentist a and dentist 2 missed it and dentist 2 even said, I’d be good for 6 months. I was on Colgate PreviDent 5000 and water flossing religiously. \n\nDentist 3 said I needed a root canal work right away. I asked how much it cost and he said $1300 plus but could go up to to $1600 if there was a complication. I told him I hadn't budged for a root canal because it was not in my other dentist's treatment plan. He said the other clinic had sent the x-rays and asked me how much I could afford for the visit and after I told him he said he’d do 6 other teeth that needed minor work and do the root canal the next visit. Cost me $1934, a few dollars shy of the $2000 I told him I could afford and 215 dollars difference from dentist 2 treatment plan. I was happy with the work he did on the 6 teeth though. \n\nI had 4 teeth done in 2.5 months, 6 in one day was an amazing feeling. And dentist 3 said he'd do 4 more in the next visit. I could see myself beating that 6-moth deadline. But there was the problem of the root canal.\n\nI made my next appointment in 3 weeks to do the remaining other teeth before doing the root canal on the left 3r molar. He works in many other clinics (cosmetic dentist) and this was the only available time. It worked for me too since I was worried about going from no root canal treatment plan to a root canal in 2 months. The morning of the appointment they called me to say the dentist would not be available but there was another equally good and experienced dentist who was available. Again, not learning from my lessons and probably too desperate I said ok. \n4) Dentist No.4 (August)\n\nShe looked at the right side of my teeth said she’d do 3 teeth but the third molar on my right needed a root canal too. Yes, another root canal!!!. Dentist 3 had made no mention of a root canal on the right side only the left side. He'd told me he'd do all the 4 teeth on the right side in the next visit and it didn't include a root canal.\n\nMore x-rays were done on all the 4 teeth on the right which I wasn’t even shown. She asked if she should do the root canal. Again, I told her I hadn't budged for it because I wasn't expecting another root canal. She did the 3 teeth and left the 3rd molar on the right for the next root canal appointment. \n\nHere is my problem. In 3 weeks, I’ve gone from no root canal to 1 root canal on the 3rd molar to 2 root canals on both the 3rd molar on the left and 3rd molar on the right. Each root canal costs $1300 or more, so that’s $2800 upwards.\n\nAt this point I think I need another opinion. I’ve done many x-rays in a short time and worried that the next dentist will also want to do more x-rays and this will be too much exposure to radiation. But I also have 6 months deadline before my teeth get worse. Any advice? Similar experiences? Dentist’s insight?"

    "dialogue": "Lululu: After exctraction of two upper wisdom-teeth 3 months ago im having constant headache and pain somewhere in nearby teeth in both sides, but more often on one. Can't localize exact place. It feels like something is inflammed inside. Pain there comes almost always with headache. Since last weeks my forehead getting warm and body temperature is 37° in the evenings.\n\nThe sockets itself looks good and healed. The gum looks fine also, not red, no places hurt if press. Only bothering thing is a small (1mm) sharp bone spur/spicule on the side of the socket, but it does not hurt itself.\n\nI already visited my doctor and did target X-ray of 7-8 molars, and he said everything is fine and need to wait more time.\n\nBut it is not fine, im so tired already of constant pain and nowhere in internet i can find anyone with similar problem. Should i insist on making CT? What can be the reason of pain, can it be bone spur or some kind of teeth shift maybe after freed space?\n\nCold water helps a bit.\n\n1 tablet of 400mg Ibuprofen helps for 1+ day. But im usually taking only one per week. Lululu: I think i found the source: it is probably TMJ disorder, all symptoms are similar. Also having a weird popping sound on one side of jaw when chewing. John Morgens: Constant pain and headache after wisdom tooth extraction can be caused by several factors:\n\nStrain in facial muscles: Mouth and jaw muscles tighten up during a tooth extraction, which affects the face as well as head muscles, causing headaches. The strain starts from the gums and goes all the way up to your head. It’s also possible to feel jaw pain too. You are more likely to experience jaw pain and headaches if you have dental or tooth extraction fear.\nImproper bite: When wisdom teeth grow into a mouth that doesn’t have enough room for them, it can cause other teeth to shift, resulting in an improper bite. An improper bite can cause your lower jaw to compensate, and this may cause pain and soreness, including headaches.\nPostoperative headaches: Oral surgery can leave you with a stiff jaw, which can lead to tension headaches. The surgery itself may also lead to postoperative headaches, including migraines, caused by anesthesia, stress and anxiety, pain, sleep deprivation, blood.\nDental problems: Dental decay or oral surgery to remove impacted wisdom teeth can also cause postoperative headaches.\nInfection: You can experience pain or headaches after teeth removal due to an underlying infection, dry socket, decaying bone, or sinus damage.\nFractures or tears: Depending on the amount of physical force required to remove the tooth, you may end up with small fractures or tears around the extraction site, which can cause headaches.\nIt is important to contact your dentist or oral surgeon if you experience constant pain and headache after wisdom tooth extraction for three months. They can provide you with specific instructions and advice based on your individual case. In the meantime, applying a hot or cold compress to your head, taking pain relievers, and avoiding hard or crunchy foods may help alleviate the pain."

    "dialogue": "Mikay: So a few days ago I was having dinner and I was chewing something and I immediately felt a bit weird. Now when I try to chew something one of my premolar/molar teeth on the upper right side hurts when I bite down. Also the gums around that area hurt when I push my tongue against them.\nI've attached a video link that better shows where the pain is. The area where I touch down with the pick is where it seems to be the most tender. The gums hurt when I touch that area but also its painful when I bite down in that area.\n\n\n\nI am 26M, I don't smoke, don't drink, and have no medical conditions.\nI'm planning to make an appointment with the dentist in a few days. MattKW: Maybe you jammed some food in there and did some mild damage. If so, it'll heal within a few days.\nAnother possibility is a tooth fracture - quite unlikely in an unfilled tooth, but can happen. Your dentist can use a FracFinder and transillumination to see if this is likely. John Morgens: it sounds like you might be experiencing dental sensitivity or a dental issue in the specific area you mentioned. Here are a few possible reasons for the pain you're feeling when biting down:\n\nDental Decay/Cavity: A cavity or dental decay could be causing the pain. When you bite down, the pressure might be exacerbating the pain by putting additional stress on the affected tooth.\n\nCracked Tooth: If a tooth is cracked or fractured, biting down can cause discomfort or pain. Cracked teeth can be sensitive to pressure and temperature changes.\n\nGum Infection or Abscess: Pain when touching the gums and when biting down could be a sign of a gum infection or abscess. These infections can cause localized pain and discomfort.\n\nDental Restoration Issues: If you have a dental filling, crown, or other restoration in that area, it's possible that it has become dislodged, damaged, or has an issue, leading to pain when biting.\n\nGum Recession: If your gums have receded, the sensitive root surface of your tooth might be exposed, causing pain when pressure is applied.\n\nSinus Infection: In some cases, a sinus infection can cause upper teeth to become sensitive to pressure, leading to pain when biting.\n\nIt's important to schedule an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible to diagnose the cause of your pain. Your dentist will conduct a thorough examination, possibly including X-rays, to determine the underlying issue and recommend appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you can try to avoid chewing on that side of your mouth and practice good oral hygiene to help alleviate discomfort."

    "dialogue": "goldrock82: Hi - 48 yr old male here.  Been dealing with what I feel is dry mouth for a year or so now and it's very annoying.  I'm a former tobacco user and although I realize I need to go, I haven't been to the dentist in years.  I don't go because I've never been fan and of course concerned about potential bad news from tobacco use.  Despite this, I do brush and floss regularly and my mouth and gums seem to be ok, from what I can tell anyway - so take that for what it's worth.  Some aspects/symptoms of what I feel is dry mouth is the following - 1) I need to speak a lot for work and it doesn't take much speaking for me to feel like my mouth is dry and it needs some relief (water, lozenge, etc.).  2) I keep waking up with progressively worse cotton mouth in the morning 3) I seem to get some markers of dry mouth like enflamed taste buds and little sores in my mouth - they do go away but show up routinely 4) occasional slight metallic taste from my upper inner gums 5) more sensitive to alcohol & spicy foods than before - specifically tongue and roof of mouth.  I've tried so many remedies of all types, e.g., dry mouth tooth paste, Biotene mouthwash, Salivea mouthwash, dry mouth lozenges, drinking lots of water, jolly ranchers, etc..  Nothing seems to make my condition improve and all of the remedies above are only very temporary.  I have noticed that eating seems to relieve my dry mouth feeling, maybe because when I eat more saliva is produced, I don't know.\n\nOne of the most annoying parts of my dry mouth is the frequent feeling of my upper inside gums near my hard palate.  They feel almost always feel rough and dry and I'm always running my tongue over them.  It's sort of the source of the most dryness.  I've attached some images.  One of them (Picture #1) I've included arrows which show the location of part that's a bit rough and dry.    When I look at the arrowed parts in a mirror and shine a light, those spots have a whitish appearance as compared to the rest of my mouth.  In the pictures, the arrowed parts don't appear to be that white.  Picture #2 doesn't highlight the whitish part either.  Picture #3 does seem to show some of the whiteness and I've added an arrow showing what I mean.  The gum is darker right night to the tooth and has some kind of white coloration as it gets further away from the tooth.  I don't know if this is normal, an indication of dryness, or something else or worse.  I've also included an image of my tongue.  I feel like the my tongue has some kind of whiteness going on and I do brush it and scrape it but it doesn't really seem to get much better.  I've been reading on line as to what it could be and it's too hard to come to a conclusion.  Things that come up are dry mouth, thrush, trapped bacteria on tongue, diabetes induced dry mouth (I'm not diabetic last I checked), and leukoplakia.  I'm going to visit a dentist but need to figure out who to go to.  \n\nSo for now, does anyone have any insight as to what might be going on based on the information provided?  If it's dry mouth, are there better solutions?  Any prescription meds that can help?  Thanks for reading and any insight you have to offer. MattKW: There are salivary tests available to get a quantitative assessment of your salivary issues. If your dentist doesn't have a kit available, then referral to an oral biologist would be an idea. Note that the quantity of saliva alone may not be the problem - saliva contains both mucous (sticky) and serous (runny) components.  I attach a file with the more common causes of dry mouth highlighted (medicines, alcohol, smoking,...)"

He doesn't like to floss and when he does what we later figured out was that he doesn't do it properly. He almost never reaches his gums! He complained about how he can't be gentle and his teeth are bleeding. I later confirmed with our dentist that he has gingivitis. He asked me if I could floss for him and show him how to do it. He initially thought that I am more gentle that he is. I had nothing against it and asked reddit for advice. But a lot of the comments were he can do it by himself. We developed a plan which I shared with our dentist. People there insisted that I should wear protection. I first thought it is not necessary but well and I quote Shit's nasty.\n\n\n\nSo I talked to our dentist. We have a good and interactive relationship with him as well as all our other physicians coaches instructors etc. He thought that my Idea was a very kind and effective one. Reddit had proposed to me to floss from Monday too Saturday and he flosses than on Sundays. My brother has no disability but simply doesn't really like to floss and has no routine. To the comments that tell me he should do it by himself because he is old enough etc. Well we tried for more than 3 years. And even our dentist explained to him the consequences of not flossing properly. It didn't work. I look at it in the same way a student who is not interested in a subject. Telling him to study won't change a thing! My goal is to build a routine that he follows. And yes, he has no cavities and brushes hist teeth regularly.\nSo now that these points are out of the way, the question of for me is the proper gear for flossing. Many in reddit have said that I should wear protection. But the question is what exactly. Because I didn't want to keep his patients waiting anymore I didn't get the chance to talk to him (dentist) about this in detail but he told me protection goes both ways: I keep myself protected and protect him equally. He just told me that there is no such thing as too much protection. And it is very easy for us to get any kind of medical gear as long as it isn't really sth that's unique, in fact because of covid we do have a lot of it in our basement.\nSo what would you suggest?\n\nOnly serious replies please"

If the roots are clearly visible, they can be split and elevated out quite easily. If you leave it for long, there will be gum tissue growing over the roots and then the removal process might require a more surgical approach, involving cutting of the gingiva as well as sutures. It is best to see a dentist as soon as possible, since these roots might also be an infection risk. Canary: I recently had a tooth removed that had decayed so bad the top of it finally broke off. The dentist literally had to dig for an hour to remove a root that was so small it reminded me of a needle in a haystack.

Do you have photos or x-rays that you can share? shawnmcc: My dentist had moved the first molar put a filler in place to keep the gap there. He thought I had lost the first so they put it in there to maintain. Dr M: Did he not take any x-rays to confirm that there was still a tooth that will eventually erupt? shawnmcc: I havent had xrays recently but one tooth has already erupted this one is begining to crown out of the gum. So it definently going to erupt and the crowns around the tooth feel loose and wiggly. Dr M: It sounds like the bridge will have to be removed and remade if this is the case shawnmcc: Definatly needs to be removed then because the tooth might actualy go partialy through it when fully erupts.

Most online advice says a few days but is that normally 2 or 7 ?  Obviously if it was to worsen I would try for an emergency appointment but how long do you think I should wait to see if it will be ok? Dr M: Sometimes the mobility can last for a week or more. I would advise sticking to a soft diet as much as possible until you notice that it stabilizes. It should be fine to wait until your appointment if you don't have any pain or if the mobility stays more or less the same. It is important however that the dentist examines the amount of bone around the tooth in question. It might be that the mobility might be related to the periodontitis and not to you biting into something hard. Teawaster: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSometimes the mobility can last for a week or more.

I suspect that you are correct in that the bite wasn’t directly responsible for the loose tooth, although it was a very definite event. No movement before the bite and loose afterwards. Presumably it was a trigger. If that’s the case and my gums are the underlying cause , would you still expect the tooth to tighten in the next while? Dr M: Not without any intervention. Periodontal treatment by a periodontist might be indicated in your case"

Dr M: If you still have severe pain after about 3-5 days after the extraction, there is a chance that you might be experiencing a dry socket. If that is the case, you will need to see the dentist to have the socket rinsed out and treated.

Does this look like a life threatening emergency or can I just wait till my scheduled appointment in a month? Dr M: Good day\nIt is difficult to see clearly on the photo. The infection might be associated with the erupting wisdom, since it definitely requires extraction, but I would also suggest taking an x-ray of the adjacent tooth, since the abscess might be associated with that tooth as well.

I drink it through a straw and try to swish some water in my mouth between sips to mitigate staining. It’s only once a day for 10 minutes max, not sipping on it all day. I brush twice daily, floss every night, use mouthwash 2-3x daily, tongue brush, the whole bit.\n\nAt my recent dental appointment, I was told that I had gingivitis and needed to floss. I was so perplexed by this and when I told them I flossed everyday and the dentist just seemed to not believe me and kept giving me that advice.\n\nThis was before the spots I mentioned showed up, but I already had the darker spots on my gum line which I learned was from gum recession. I did learn that it’s probably because I was brushing too hard and too long…so I’ve been more cautious of that. I use a sonicare toothbrush, an SLS-free tooth builder toothpaste and a fluoride mouthwash once daily. I also use a gingivitis mouthwash (am + pm) and a sea salt one to gargle with.\n\nI don’t eat a lot of sugar, I avoid whitening products because of sensitivity and don’t want to do any more damage to my enamel.

If you have the right instruments and skills, it won't be too worrisome.\nThe bone behind your wisdoms is higher than for other teeth in a more forward position, so more effort and care will be required.\nThe roots (2 or 3?) are quite divergent for lower wisdom teeth. Usually they are more cone-shaped and easier. I see that your upper wisdoms were also quite divergent, so if your dentist coped OK with the uppers, then he is probably quite capable of removing the lowers. Sometimes divergent roots require them to be drilled into separate roots to make the overall extraction easier.\nIn the sort term (5-10 years), there is little risk of problems if you leave the lower wisdoms in there. But... I would also recommend their removal sooner rather than later because the difficulty starts to increase significantly over the age of 30yo, and if you are young and in good health, it will be easier and you will heal better. \nThe long-term risks is that if you wait till you are 60yo+, then it is quite likely you might have other health issues (diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, blood thinners) that would make it a much more risky procedure requiring possible day hospital and specialist removal.

    "dialogue": "credenza: Is this something I can request my dentist to do? I have anxiety surrounding the numbing of my whole face and am looking to see if it’s possible to just numb a specific area for the most part. I am not worried about needles, just being numb. MattKW: For upper teeth in general, the numbing is fairly localised because the injection is placed immediately adjacent to the bone and soaks through the relatively porous bone - an infiltration injection. Numbness of upper back teeth is the least annoying to patients, upper front teeth involving the lips is more annoying. Upper infiltrations are so reliable that we normally just get straight to work after a few minutes without checking the tooth numbness with a vitality test.\nThe bone around lower back teeth is usually too thick to allow penetration of the bone by direct infiltration, so a block injection is used which takes out the whole nerve to all lower teeth plus half the tongue and half the lip. This is the one that annoys most people. It has the added benefit that when your lip goes numb, we know that your teeth are numb.\n\nInfiltration of the upper teeth wears off faster than injections for lower teeth because there is a better blood supply in the upper jaw.\nThe numbness to the teeth is is shorter than numbness to the soft tissues (cheek, lip, gums). For teeth most LA (combined with adrenaline) wears off in 60-90 mins, but the soft tissues may go 3-5 hours, and that works fine for most dental procedures from a dentist perspective. A shorter effect is obtained with LA that has no adrenaline but the operating time is lessened and not always good from a dental perspective. \nThe adrenaline prolongs the numbness by restricting the blood vessels and thus the ability for the LA to be carried away. It also helps reduce bleeding if doing a bloody procedure like extractions. Surgical extractions with a plain LA is quite bloody.\nSome people claim that an articaine LA can be used as infiltration for lower back teeth - unfortunately it's not reliable, and if it doesn't work then you have to add a block which maybe should've been done anyway.\nFor lower front teeth (incisors)  you can try infiltration with relatively good success, or a lower mental block (premolars and incisors) which doesn't numb the tongue.\nThere are other techniques like intraligamental - instant effect but short working time and more risk of bruising to local gums; intraosseous - instant effect but slow healing of injection site and higher risk of other complications. These techniques are generally better kept for supplemental LA usage where infiltration or blocks have not worked well enough, e.g. \"hot\" pulps.\nFor upper front teeth some dentists and hygienists like to try a palatal AMSA because it can numb teeth and gums but not the lips. The downside is that it is best used without adrenaline so as to avoid possible tissue damage, but this will reduce working time.\nThere is a reversal injection called Oraverse available that increases the local blood supply where adrenaline has been used. Some care must be used, but also consider that any painful procedure (deep fillings, extractions, deep scaling) will therefore wake up quicker, plus you will have extra tissue bruising from the added injection.\nAnecdotally, I have had a few patients who go to the gym after a simple filling and the exercise increases the blood flow and makes it wear off faster. Not after extractions!  \nSo, no perfect answer. credenza: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFor upper teeth in general, the numbing is fairly localised because the injection is placed immediately adjacent to the bone and soaks through the relatively porous bone - an infiltration injection.

You say a LA for teeth wears off in about 60-90 minutes but lasts 3-5 hours on the soft tissues - what about LA without adrenaline? How long do teeth and soft tissue stay numb then?\n\nThank you! MattKW: I've never heard of any colleagues using Oraverse (phentolamine mesylate) so it might be hard to find.\nSorry, LA without adrenaline only seems to reduce the length of tooth numbness, not the tissue numbness. Prob due to different nerve fibres for pain versus pressure.\nMaybe it'd just be easier to go for a brisk walk afterwards!"

Over time I have realized I have a lot of different sized small hard lumps inside the tissue in front of my lower teeth and a few in my cheeks/upper lip area. They seem to mostly be in the areas I frequent bite, although some are not places I could reach. \n\nThey aren’t painful and they aren’t visible. I can feel them slightly with my tongue and a lot more with my fingers if I feel along the inside of my lower lip area. I suspect they’ve been there a long time but I only noticed how many there are recently. I get regular dental checkups and I had a full exam 2 months ago with panoramic X-rays and the dentist has never mentioned them.\n\nWondered if anyone else has similar or any idea what they might be? Plan to ask the dentist next time I’m in but thought I’d ask here too. Thanks. Dr M: Difficult to say without a photo. I would think it might be mucoceles due to frequent trauma in the area. Usually not something to worry about. anc345: Thank you for your reply.  Unfortunately there isn’t much to see to take a photo of.  The lumps are more under the skin not on top so only really visible if you pull the skin tight and you can see there is a lump.  There are many of them. 10+ I’d say and everything I’ve seen online about fibroid or mucoceles says there are rarely multiple?   My dentist did examine my mouth 2 months ago at my regular appt but as I said these are under the skin and really only noticeable by feeling them with finger.    I will check in with the dentist again but in the mean time just giving info in case anyone has an idea.   I did see an old post from another chronic lip biter describing the same thing so guessing it may be related to that.   Thanks again. MattKW: Probably Fordyce granules, not mucocele. anc345: Thank you.  For anyone reading with similar, I saw my dentist and he said they are enlarged salivary glands.

    "title": "How much pain during drilling (ie for filling or crown) is normal?",
    "dialogue": "Goldzircstein: I saw a dentist a few years ago to have an old filling replaced. The dentist injected what I assume was the usual freezing painkiller and proceeded. I honestly wasn't always in much pain but I felt it more than I expected. I tried to man it up telling myself it's probably impossible to have a totally pain-free procedure but I had tears streaming down my face the entire time due to the pain. Is that normal? I'd had other fillings done in the past without anything close to that kind of pain, so I was surprised that it was so painful. Is there an explanation aside from what seems like the obvious one: I wasn't given enough pain killer? I didn't return to that dentist and had another filling done by a new dentist without difficulty. I guess it doesn't matter at this point since I don't plan on going back to the painful dentist but I'm still curious about why that even happened. Dr M: It sounds like the nerve might not have been fully anesthetized. Everyone's anatomy is different, and even the most experienced dentist can sometimes fail to fully numb a tooth on the first try. It is important to let your dentist know if you can still feel pain. Goldzircstein: Thank you so much for responding. It is extremely helpful to be able to ask a dentist some basic questions. There are so many unexpected factors for the lay patient.\n\nI am also wondering something about a current situation. I switched dentists recently because there was a communication breakdown with the old one. I was prepped for a pfm crown on a molar but decided to get a gold crown instead. The new dentist who will be putting the gold crown in wants over an hour to smoothen the tooth that was prepped for the pfm and make a new mold impression. Is that normal? Maybe it's a new technique and there can always be details whose potential importance I might not even be aware of but it would be so reassuring to know if you or other dentists could identify a reason right off the bat. MattKW: A PFM prep is a heavier reduction than for gold, so there should be no extra removal/drilling needed. After all, a PFM is really a metal substructure (usually a gold alloy) covered with porcelain. No additional smoothing is necessary unless you were changing to a ceramic crown. \nIt's possible he wants to make some minor modifications, and he would need to see the previous preparation before taking a new impression, and he doesn't have the temporary crown impression that the original dentist has. \nIt takes me 60-80 mins for a crown prep and impression on a fresh tooth, so in your case it would probably take 40-50 minutes unless I found something unexpected.\nAs regards numbing (LA), sometimes lower molar teeth are more difficult to numb completely with just a single \"block\" injection and you may need additional LA with \"infiltration\" or rarely even \"intraligamental\" LA. However, ask the dentist to check for numbness before he starts - this is as simple as putting some very cold spray on the tooth. Goldzircstein: Thank you so much for your response.\n\nI guess I will ask for a breakdown of the procedure and ask for the reasons for the smoothing. If this new dentist is somehow mistaken I could end up loosing even more tooth unnecessarily. Is there a consensus about the respective disadvantage and advantage of sharp or smooth preps? He hasn't seen it yet so I don't even know why he thinks the original prep was \"too sharp\". Is there a way of observing how sharp or smooth the prepped tooth is from photos/x-rays? MattKW: You would not get much useful info about a prep of a temporised tooth from an Xray. I would have to remove the temporary (usually no anaesthetic required) to give a definite opinion, maybe allow 30mins, but I would have to charge for my time.\nAs I said earlier, I'd give give you 40-50 mins and if there was something terribly wrong underneath then I'd re-temporise and have a chat with you. Then I've only wasted 40-50 mins rather than 1hr 20mins. I think he may just be preparing for the worst case scenario."

It is seriously annoying, irritating and hurts my mouth so much. The pain is so much to the point where it is all I think about as I go about my day. It usually lasts a while and does not subside until a few hours later. It also sucks for eating since I have to wait until the burning and pain goes away before I can eat. \n\nI am lazy, irregular and do not have the cleanest regiment/schedule for cleaning my teeth, therefore I have noticed my teeth getting more tartar, plaque and yellow over the past couple years. I don't smoke and I try and stay away from sugary beverages as much as I can. On the other hand, I do drink coffee and tea of which I know stains your teeth. I do have a sweet tooth when it comes to my diet and I tend to eat a lot of baked goods/sweets, breads and sauces/soups with sugar in them. \n\nI used to use Colgate Total Whitening brand toothpaste. The Colgate on the other hand, does not give me any problems what so ever and is totally fine. But I decided to switch to the Crest since it is a cheaper price and I can save a lot more money by going with the Crest instead of the Colgate.\n\nIs it...\n\nA. The baking soda that is causing the pain and burning sensation? I know that baking soda is a 'mild abrasive'. Therefore I figured the baking soda could be cutting too hard into my gums/mouth. \nB. The Hydrogen Peroxide that is causing the pain and burning sensation? I know that hydrogen peroxide is used for bleaching and whitening.\nC. A combination of both the baking soda and the hydrogen peroxide that is causing the pain and burning sensation? \n\nI am thinking it's C, a combination of both the baking soda and the peroxide that is causing the burning sensation. I am thinking the baking soda is cutting into my gums and mouth too deep and then the peroxide finds itself into the micro cuts and abrasions and 'stings' the inner/softer flesh/gums. \n\nWith all that said, should I just go back to the Colgate even though it's more expensive? I am willing to pay a little more if it means better well being after I brush my teeth and not having to worry about having a burning mouth as I go about my day. On the other hand, I am such a frugal and I always try and buy the cheapest products whenever I am shopping that I am afraid I might have to stick it out and see if there are any improvements and/or my mouth eventually adapting to the baking soda and peroxide and helping me develop a tolerance. \n\nHelp?! MattKW: I assume you mean the pain is affecting your gums and soft tissues? You don't mention tooth sensitivity as a problem.\nMost patients tell me of increased tooth sensitivity with \"whitening\" toothpastes compared to \"normal\" toothpastes.\nYes, whitening toothpastes with high levels of H2O2 have been shown to slowly produce an increase in whiteness after weeks of continual use, but if you continue to use stain-producing foods/drinks and only brush sporadically, then you probably wasting your money. And teeth naturally darken as we get older because the dentine tubules get denser, and the pulp (\"nerve\") recedes. \nI suggest you switch to the cheapest fluoride toothpaste you can find and concentrate on getting your overall dental hygiene and health to a good level."

    "title": "Gold vs Zirconia",
    "dialogue": "Goldzircstein: Hello,\n\nIf someone needs a crown for a lower back tooth, is gold better than zirconia? Especially when considering opposing teeth? From doing some basic research it would appear that a gold crown is, aesthetics aside, the best choice. I have also been told this by a dentist. However, there is a website for the \"Cleveland Clinic\" in which a description of zirconia crowns includes that they are gentle on opposing teeth, resulting in less enamel wear (they do not mention gold). Additionally, another dentist told me that zirconia was actually better for preserving opposing teeth. Is there a consensus based on a scientific standard of research?\n\nThe only explanation I can think of is that zirconia is made so precisely that there is never any mechanical or other problem in relation to the harmony and health of the other teeth. If that is the case I would expect it to be widely acknowledged but I can't find any decisive research about it.\n\nIf there are dentists who have an answer as to whether zirconia is as good as or better than gold, I would be interested in hearing from them. Everything seems to suggest gold is better but then a dentist made this claim about zirconia and I subsequently found the Cleveland Clinic site that seems to support it (again, they did not mention any comparison to gold). Any help would be greatly appreciated. MattKW: I would prefer gold for my back teeth. Zirconia can be comparable as long as it's polished well after any adjustments with the correct polishing burs.  Gold is more forgiving. Here's a couple of articles with highlighted text. Goldzircstein: Thank you. Goldzircstein: If someone got a PFM or Zirconia prep and then wanted to put a gold crown on instead, would they need to take new molds? If the person had to go to another dentist for the gold crown, would the second dentist need 1hr20m to take a new mold that would be sent to a lab for the gold crown. It seems odd if the prep has already been done and there are already molds at the first dentist's office. Is the mold for the gold crown done differently than the one for PFM or Zirconia?"

My old dentist knew about my phobia and knew that the more knowledge I had about everything, the more confidence I had moving forward.  I always wanted to know the names (manufacturer, specific material, etc.) of the materials used on me (filling material, adhesives, etching materials, etc.) and he would tell me.  I did not feel comfortable asking my new dentist.  I had two fillings a month ago (a glass ionomer on the gum line of a crowned upper molar and a large composite on an upper pre-molar) and am having a terrible taste in my mouth ever since.  My quality of life is being affected.  I would like to start by getting the names of all the materials used on me.  Is a dentist required to record specific products used on a patient in the patient's dental record? Do I have a right to know what those are? What would be the best way of asking for this information? She is a very busy dentist and my next appointment for more fillings is two months away and I can't wait to ask in person.  I am thinking of seeing an ENT or allergist, etc. to pursue the taste problem and since that is when it started, I really want the names of the products before proceeding.  I want to be able to compare it to the materials my dentist previously used as well.  Thank you for your time. MattKW: It's uncommon to keep really detailed info about brands, adhesives, etching materials etc altho some do given that nowadays it is relatively easy to insert stock phrases into a computer system. By all means, ask your last dentist; just send a polite request and you should be able to get all your history. They are entitled to charge a reasonable fee, but for long term patients we often don't.\nI can't think why a different brand of GIC or composite would cause you to have a different taste sensation. It is more common if something like an old filling is leaking."

Had one the next day , 4 canals out,  tooth was too painful to put temp crown on so for 2 weeks there was no temp crown.  I was v careful but the pain seemed a bit much ( my other RC years earlier was nothing like this). Finish part two of RC and temp crown goes back on.  I feel fine except cannot chew / bite on that tooth.  I’m told I need a post so I get that.  Than the perm crown. $$$$ It feels fine for about 5 days then I attempt to chew on it. YOWZA.  Back and forth to Endo and dentist.  “ all looks great.”  They did all the fancy X-rays.  I get my bite adjusted and it feels good for a week. Still not able to chew on it though as I’m told there’s a lot of inflammation. “ Give it time” .  RC was finished mid- Jan and perm crown was 8 weeks ago.  Saw another Endo for second opinion bec I’m going nuts and she put me on a 6-day steroid pack to reduce inflammation. Today was day 6 and tooth is still toothing. Tender on sides, biting on it hurts. Throbs a bit randomly; sometimes for hours.   Saw dentist today and he mentioned they could go in and dismantle everything (!!) to clean out etc.  but RC looks “ perfect.”  Seems like a very long shot to me and frankly, mentally I don’t think I could handle that only for them to find a fracture.  Second Endo fears it’s a fracture ( prob from the RC!). I see her in a week to discuss next steps.  She said no infection, bone looks good.  Has anyone ever taken this long for inflammation to quell? Am I headed for extraction?  So freaked out. MattKW: Sounds like possible fracture. It's interesting that treatment was continued despite the ongoing discomfort. If a patient is too painful to put a temp crown on it, then why would it be continued? Maybe a CBCT by the new endo will see more. Let us know what happens. Tooth30: A temp crown was made the day before by my dentist (he made one to keep the tooth covered until I could get the RCT) so I had it in before the RCT.  After the entire treatment the Endo ( who was skilled but I felt a bit rough)  tried  to put it back in but the pain was too much. Two weeks later -after initial pain had subsided —  part two and RCT was done and seemingly fine ( except eating on it was not fine).  Adjustment helped briefly.  New Endo last week did CBCT and it looked perfect.  The steroids are helping a bit but I’ll know more next week when I see her.  Just such a pain ( literally and figuratively) to go thru all this to perhaps have to extract ( which I hear is no fun either).  Still wondering if inflammation can really last this long.  Thanks for the reply. Tooth30: Update: after a 6 day course of Medrol the tooth felt a bit better.  However whenever I chew on it, pain is still there.  Endo tapped and examined it yesterday and there is definite improvement.  I go back in 3 weeks to see if it continues to improve … or not.  Endo says sometimes things take a long time to heal but it’s been 3 months since RCT and 2 months since perm crown.  Trying to keep this tooth but I don’t know. Dr M: You also have to take into consideration the cost involved in order to keep a tooth that does not want to heal. Hopefully the pain goes away, but sooner or later you have to weigh up the costs. An implant might be a better long term solution. MattKW: Tooth30 said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUpdate: after a 6 day course of Medrol the tooth felt a bit better.

I am most likely headed for extraction ; these next few weeks until my next appt is kind of a last hope to save it because I have the feeling if there is a fracture ( and I believe there is even if it’s not showing up); it’ll only get worse in time.

I’m super nervous about extraction and implant but if there is indeed a fracture I’m guessing it’ll only get worse. And I def cannot chew on it without pain.  Hoping to get some relief in the next few weeks.  Will def continue to update.  Thanks for the reply. Tooth30: Update: scheduled for extraction in a week.  No infection, bone looks good, no issues from root canal.  It’s just one of those things that prob worsened after all the dental work of RCT and crown placement.  Relieved to finally have a diagnosis and treatment plan. Oral surgeon I saw is great and I’m ready ( he will do implant in time as we’ll) . Not looking for horror stories - just posting to let people know I solved my issue.  Good luck and tooth health to everyone! MattKW: Thanks for update. Good luck."

    "dialogue": "Kernst52: We moved to a different state so this was my first visit to this dentist.  He took an x-ray of each tooth, so LOTS of x-rays.  When he showed me the x-rays I could see manty surrounding teeth in the views so it seems I got sprayed with lots of x-rays.  I am 70 years old.  I have never gotten so many x-rays in a dental exam.  Is there a reason for this?  Thanks. Dr M: Good day\n\nIt sounds like he did a full mouth exam with bite-wing x-rays and maybe some peri-apical x-rays for the anterior teeth. His reasoning could be that this was required due to it being the first time you saw him and he wanted to a thorough examination of your entire dentition. Subsequent visits should not include as many x-rays. In terms of radiation exposure, modern dental digital x-rays have a lot less harmful radiation than the older film x-rays. MattKW: A full-mouth survey (FMS) using standard dental xrays seems to be a very US-thing to do and the total dosage is about 150mSv; I don't know why (anybody answer?).\nIn Australia, it would be reasonable for a new patient to take 2 standard xrays (bitewings, BWs) and an OPG (full mouth scan) from which I might then take another 1-2 separate periapical xrays (PA) totalling about 50mSv. For future check-ups taken 2-3 years later, you would only need 2-4 BWs at 10-20 mSv. And the OPG will show up a much wider field of the head and mouth than an FMS.\nFor comparison, a full chest Xray or a trans-Atlantic flight is about 30mSv.\nThis is micro-Sieverts, not milli-."

Thanks for the response @Dr M . Appreciate it.\n\nCan we do deep cleaning on that molar when they suspect a hidden infection underneath? Zac we still do deep cleaning even if that tooth is infected at the bottom?\n\nI have chronic jaw pain for 3 years without any relief yet. Then CBCT and MRI of jaw and neck without any definite answers. \n\nI had this tooth 30( first molar) which was painful for tapping and biting pressure. Had around five CBCT scans on that tooth with different Endodontist over the last 3 years. No issues or nothing seen on that scan. \n\nSince Tooth was painful, that suspect that tooth could be causing my lower jaw pain near the ear lobe where the mandible ends. Had root canal on that tooth to see if it gets better.. Unfortunately it didn't help and more pain on that Tooth 30. I had different Endodontist did several retreatments of root canal on it. It didn't help at all and more pressure pain on that tooth.. Even when that tooth was there, I was having gum pain in tooth 31( now paining gums second molar). I even saw a periodontist to check tooth 30 and gum of 31. \n\nI ended up pulling that tooth 30 and surgeon said it was infected at the bottom when he took it out. Infected at the bottom and at the jaw bone. Didn't know it was infected and wasn't seen on any of the cbct scans.\n\nUnfortunately extraction didn't help with my jaw pain. All pain remains the same once the anesthesia wears off. Same jaw pain and pain in socket area of#30. And gums of 31. It's been 9 months after the extraction. It just hurts in the socket gum. \n\n\nThe next tooth gum#31 hurts for around 2 years now. Dentist just dismiss everytime by seeing the x-ray that it looks ok. But it hurts like throbbing in the gum margin surrounding that Tooth..I just scream and jump off dental chair when they probe that tooth gum 31. \n\n\nDefinitely something is wrong but don't know what's the issue on it. I do floss but this tooth 31 always get bad tartar buildup on it. I had deep cleaning for the first time in my lungs in Feb 2021 on the right side of the mouth only because tooth 31 had tartar buildup and severe gum pain. \n\nIt didn't help and I ended up feeling more tartar buildup now. I am scheduled for deep cleaning in June but the surgeon said I can remove this tooth since it was painful when he pressed with fingers during evaluation. So he said it shouldn't be painful and something wrong, that's why it was painful.  He wanted to extract it rather than deep cleaning.\n\nI am yet to see the dentist after the surgeon visit. Dentist said tooth looks ok during my last visit.. But he said he don't have any answers on why this gum is so swollen which is not normal. \n\nDo I need to see the Endodontist first to ask if root canal will help to save this tooth? Does gum swelling indicates infection? \n\nI have deep cleaning appointment only in June. Severe throbbing pain in gum everyday and pain increases in lower jaw near the ear( my usual pain spot ) and that gum immediately after I lay down. Pain just throbs in the gum margin on right and back side of that gum. Right distal side and back side of the Tooth gum always throbbing. Stackflow: My old x-rays.

    "dialogue": "Kira: On May 8, I had a root canal procedure on a tooth that'd already had a root canal on it. The tooth had not been giving me any pain, despite being abscessed. Everything went as it should have, and I didn't have any pain.\n\nHowever, on the 11th, the tooth right next to it began hurting, and it's been getting steadily worse ever since. They told me I'd probably feel pain in the area, and to treat it with OTC medications, but the pain I'm feeling is similar to that of an abscess. It's a mild, constant, throbbing pain that worsens when you tap on it. What I don't understand, though, is what's going on. The X-rays that I have clearly show that the tooth in question has zero infection. None. They're from April 20th of this year, so still pretty recent. Another thing: When they took new X-rays (those I don't have) when I went in for the procedure, they warned me about a slightly dark area in the front tooth, which they said could've been something else entirely, and it'd be okay to let it go for now. However, the tooth that's actually hurting now, they never said a word about it. Fact that they warned me about one and not the other gives me hope that this is normal, and everything can go back to the way it was. Enclosed are the x-rays of what I'm talking about. I have the ones pre-retreatment, but not post.\n\nBasically what I'm asking is, is this normal? Is what I'm describing something that sounds like the normal part of the recovery process? Or do I need a procedure done on number 8, 200? 7 was the one with the abscess, 8 is next to it. Both were part of the same crown. Dr M: A post treatment x-ray would  be helpful to rule out any problems with the adjacent tooth. It could just be referred pain from the treated tooth. If the infection was severe, it could take a while for the infection to clear up.

That’s when my tongue began to bleed. Concerned, I saw an ENT who swabbed my tongue and had it tested for Candida.

    "dialogue": "stellarella333: Here to get some advice/input on the process of getting dentures. I am very interested in immediate dentures/full extraction. I have been to several different dentist, all of who are pressuring me to not go through with it and downright refusing to do this solely because I am in my 20s. I have been told my entire mouth is full of cavities and that all of my teeth need crowns/repaired, which is clearly visible to me, but it makes a lot more sense to just pull them out and not have to worry about them again, right? If it were just a couple of teeth, sure. But were talking my entire mouth. I get no other reason for being told no besides I am too young. I find this completely ridiculous, I have even been told I won't ever be able to eat right again, by people who have never experienced dentures in the first place. They are also not missing almost all of their canines like i am.  I have to decide everytime I eat something which side I'd like to burn my mouth on this time, as well as chew on one side of my mouth, I also can not use my front teeth because I have a wiggly tooth that I have been told needs extracted. I don't even taste my food anymore, I essentially just swish it around and swallow it because if food gets into any of the crowns I do have, it is extremely painful. BTW paid nearly 10k to have a bridge and 2 other crowns put in, they are falling out within a year and my teeth have cavities underneath them. I got them in literally a year ago. I brush/floss/rinse multiple times a day. One crown fell out the other day. I went to the dentist and I told her to just pull the tooth, she argued with me over it and kept pushing me to have her repair the cavity on the little nub that is barely hanging on that was my tooth, and put the crown back on. They were ready to repair the tooth, had the equipment ready and all, I refused and suddenly they ended the appointment and said they will have to schedule it. Still pressuring the crown, oh and... 185 for the extraction, over 1k to do all of that other BS. They also never called me.

    "dialogue": "fml88: I had my upper right wisdom tooth removed on the 26th, it was rotting, it had a hole and there was a sharp part poking my cheek and making it bleed, the tooth also hurt and the pain was spreading to my ear. The dentist took an xray, said there was no infection but that she should remove it. It took less than a minute. After that she put a gauze in my mouth but I started gagging, almost throwing up and she removed it, no gauze after that, she just gave me an ice pack that I held to my face until it got warm. Her instructions were to not spit, that I could brush my teeth normally, to eat soft, cold foods only, to keep my head elevated during sleep and when I asked about mouth wash she told me it wasn't really necessary to rinse with anything. I went home and the first two days were fine, I would feel some discomfort in the area and sharp pain now and then and it would spread to my ear but that was only on day 1, hours after having it removed. I had no pain on day 2 and I didn't even take pain medication. On day three I woke up with discomfort in the socket that was spreading to my ear and I felt a weird taste in my mouth. My first thought was dry socket even though I followed all the instructions. This was last saturday, I called the office, it's far from where I live, but only the reception was open. I explained the situation to the ladyon the phone and she said she would call the dentist to see if she could prescribe something. Hours later I receive a prescription of azithromycin on my phone to take for 5 days. At this point I had been washing my mouth, not rinsing, with warm salt water for two days because I read online it was good, i never rinsed, still don't, i just let the water sit in my mouth, do some really gentle motions so it moves a little and then open my mouth so it falls off instead of spitting. It's day three of azythromycin and lucky me I got sick two days ago, sore throat, fever, runny nose, cough so I feel like hell but I haven't been having any pain on the socket or my ear, maybe some discomfort now and then that spreads to the ear but that's it but in the last hour I've been having the pain in my ear but I don't feel anything in my socket besides mild discomfort. I'm on paracetamol for my fever and have been for two days every 6 hours. Could this be nerve pain? Could it be caused by all the coughing and being sick in general mixed with the tooth extraction? Should I properly rinse with warm salt water, keep doing what I'm doing or not rinse at all? I wanted the teeth out because of the pain and because I couldn't eat but here I am, still starving. Dr M: There is a chance that it could be a mixed situation. You can consider going to your doctor, if it is nearer to your house. If you did have a dry socket,it is usually a self limiting disease, which means it would have cleared up by itself. If the pain is not that bad in the socket area, I would suggest finishing the course of antibiotics, and maybe consider taking some ibuprofen as well. Drink lots of fluids. If there is no improvement after the antibiotics is finished, you might have a viral infection, and need to see your medical doctor. MattKW: Sounds like you may have had a dry socket. They are not caused by spitting or rinsing, nor are they improved by the use of antibiotics. However, they are self-limiting so I think you are past the dry socket stage and whatever illness you are having now would be unrelated. Rinse all you like - upper wisdoms removed in a minute usually heal very nicely anyway."

    "dialogue": "Naganoken: I recently went to the dentist and had a root canal done on a (#19 molar) The tooth in question had a deep filling done on it that touched the nerve but was not infected at all. I had very intermittent pain with this tooth. I would go 2 weeks with no pain and then just have one day with pain, and it would go away again. The question is if a root canal was even necessary in this case. Feeling regret about it now. MattKW: Repeated occurrence of unstimulated pain following a \"touched\"nerve will neaRly always result in dead tooth. I would warn my patients after \"touching a nerve\" (pulp exposure) to prepare for a Root Canal Therapy (or extraction) within 18 months.

I would warn my patients after \"touching a nerve\" (pulp exposure) to prepare for a Root Canal Therapy (or extraction) within 18 months. I found out today that the dentist only did a \"pulpotomy\" and not a full root canal treatment. Since the tooth was never infected should I try to get a filling / crown done. I have a temp. filling now. Or should I go through with the full root canal treatment as the dentist recommends. MattKW: You should go through with the RCT. Although there is evidence mounting for pulpotomy-only success in adult teeth (rather than a full RCT), it requires careful protocols for good outcomes and further research. My personal experience with pulpotomies in the old days is that failure occurred at 18-24 months later, and then an RCT is required anyway. In the meantime, if you leave a pulpotomy and just do a standard filling, there is a great risk of the tooth fracturing and having to be extracted.\nI would suggest a full RCT and crown. Naganoken: Thank you, I'll go ahead as planned. I have 1 last question (unrelated),  I'm trying to slow down any further dental damage from now on. What's your stance on electric toothbrushes vs. traditional, as well as is a waterpik helpful. Not sure how much of a difference this stuff really makes but I want to stave off further root canals..\n\n\nMattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tYou should go through with the RCT.

Flossing beats waterpiks hands down, but requires practice, maybe have a hygienist show you a good technique. Once you get the hang of it, it'll only take 30 secs to do your mouth.\nThe biggest reason I see with decay rates is the high intake of sugary drinks rather than simple, plain, cheap, fluoridated tap water."

Dr M: A re-treatment can be attempted by an endodontist. But there is always the risk that the infection can return again. You also have to weigh the financial implications of a re-treatment, compared to an extraction and replacement. MattKW: I would prefer to base an opinion on dental bitewing and periapical xrays rather than a distorted CBCT. Any to show us? Stekaz: No...\n\nWhat do you mean distorted? I thought cbct is the best tool fot planning root canal treatment, certainly the most expensive MattKW: Well, you started this thread by asking about decay in an upper molar. Using CBCT is an expensive, radio-intense, innacurate, and inappropriate (unethical?) way to look for decay. \nA typical single dental bitewing for decay is about 5 microSv compared to 300-500 microSv for a large dental CBCT such as you show. CBCT are useful in endo for individual teeth where there is a small FoV (field of view) and doses are much better at 40 microSv. Stekaz: Ok, thank you for explanation.\n\nSo what's  CBCT good for? MattKW: CBCT in endo is good for cross-sectional views to investigate the location and number of canals, pulp chamber size and degree of calcification, root structure, direction and curvature, fractures, and iatrogenic defects."

MattKW: Not a silly question. Just looks like tissue has healed lumpily, possibly due to a difficult extraction that left a lot of uneven scar tissue. Shouldn't really interfere with denture.

    "dialogue": "John-Mark Lonon: So the last few weeks I had found a small red sore on the roof of my mouth. The only way I was able to notice this was after drinking a soda(If I had not done this I would have never knew it was there) because it burned. So I took a flashlight and looked and found the red sore. It was flat and smooth with no consistency to it and didn't hurt unless I drank a carbonated/hot drink. a couple weeks went by and it has gotten to be the size of a penny. I went to my dentist that I usually use and he didn't know what it was and suggested I go see an oral surgeon. So before I did that I went and had a second opinion from another dentist who is my buddys dad. He said it looked weird since it was a perfect circle and that most lesions did not ever have a perfect shape to them. He said it did not look cancerous since it wasn't white and that usually the upper roof of the mouth wasn't a common place to get it, unlike the lower gums, tongue and bottom of the mouth. I told him that I just quit dipping, but he said it wouldn't be related since I couldn't and wouldn't hold my dip on the roof of my mouth. He also had his nurses look at it and their first inclination was that it looked like ringworm. Which I don't think you can get that in your mouth. Overall he thinks it might be an allergic reaction to something since there are some raw areas on the lesion and wants to watch it for a week or two.\n\nThis is freaking me out so any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for looking and have a great day! Busybee: It doesn't look like anything nasty, but the fact that it hurts when you have acidic drinks and the fact it's getting bigger is interesting.  \n\nYou should get some tests done on the area, test for any virus including cold sores and HPV (just in case).   Although if you had a virus you'd expect to see more of these marks...  You can't get ringworm in your mouth.  \n\nWhat is dipping?  \n\nAre you feeling well otherwise?     \n\nI do think it's frustrating that dentists should be in charge of all things mouth.  This sort of thing should be examined by someone more specialised.    \n\n It's possibly a local infection or reaction.  It's maybe an idea to ask your doctor for a course of antibiotics (because you mention it's spreading).   Or try some antihistamines.   \n\nI had an infection on the roof of my mouth about ten years ago after burning it with some food.  I went swimming when the area was still sore and must have transmitted some infection from the pool.  I ended up with a salivary gland infection,but the area was painful and I did feel very unwell.   \n\n Please do let us know if you get to the bottom of the mystery.   It's hopefully nothing to worry about. John-Mark Lonon: Dipping is the use of smokeless tobacco. Where you take a \"dip\" means taking a pinch of fine cut tobacco and putting it in your lower lip. And yes I am feeling fine, the only thing that reminds me of the sore is when I drink something carbonated. John-Mark Lonon: Got in to see the oral surgeon last week and he felt like it was an allergic reaction to something. He prescribed me the oral rinse Peridax. And after using it 3 times a day it has started to go away. Busybee: That's great news.  Perhaps you're allergic to the tobacco.  Even though you don't chew it up there you might have swished some of the juice and irritated the roof of the mouth.  Chewing tobacco can give you oral cancer so well done on giving up. Pleiades270: I currently have one on my lip. I don’t chew tobacco, smoke or anything odd. It doesn’t burn when I drink soda, has anyone figured out what it is?

MattKW: I can't help you with NHS questions, but as for the others:\n\nYou would have to pay for the Consultation and the RCT. \nA Retreatment only applies for an existing RCT, which you don't have, so this is not necessary in your case.\nAs long as the last dentist didn't damage your old gold crown too much when trying to get it off, then it should only have an access hole in the top surface. There is no need to replace the crown; the RCT continues through the gold crown, and then the access cavity is refilled. The crown still surrounds the tooth and prevents fractures just like it always did. This would have to be assessed and confirmed at the consultation."

Dr M: Practice good oral hygiene habits, such as as brushing twice a day and flossing. You can also consider using an alcohol-free mouthrinse. GSK recently released a toothpaste called Parodontax. It has been proven to combat gingival inflammation better than conventional toothpastes. \nThe best would still be to get a professional cleaning done.

Finally my retainers arrived last week and I’ve been told I need to now wear my retainers full time (22hrs) for a further 6months. I never knew this to be honest before starting I kind of thought it would be 19weeks of Invisalign then I just wear retainers on a night time for life. \n\nSo now I’ve got to go through the pain of wearing these full time for 6months, mouthwash every time time I eat etc and anyone who’s done Invisalign will know how annoying and life consuming this is and it does kind of ruin your social life. It probably seems like I’m moaning when I chose to pay for it and I’m not at all I’m absolutely thrilled with my results I now have a beautiful straight smile but I just never thought I’d have another 6months of permanent retainer trays as 19weeks was bad enough.\n\nNow my question is to preferably a dentist or orthodontist, do I really NEED to have them in for 6months? It’s just I go on holiday in June and I’m getting married in summer and I absolutely do not want these in for my holiday or wedding. I was thinking could I maybe have them in permanently for 3/4months till I go on holiday then after 3/4months change to just at bed time or is it absolutely necessary that I MUST have them in for 6months? It just seems a bit over kill.\n\nOf course it is an absolute must and if I only do it for 3months and my teeth will start to go wonky or something, of course I will do it for 6months as I don’t want all my hard work undone.\n\nThank you MattKW: Without knowing the details of your case, I don't know how necessary this is, but it sounds a bit excessive. So, try this test:\n\nLeave out retainer for 12 hours and then put back in. If your teeth have moved slightly, you'll feel the tightness and it will mean that you need to wear it as much as they suggest.\nIf you have no tightness, you can try leaving out for a 24 hour period, then re-insert and test for tightness. \nIf tightness, then you may only need to wear it nightly. \nIf no tightness, then you can go up to 24 hrs.\nLet us know the results pls.

I went along for the inspection/testing and the results came back that my filling was not gold. It was not going to do any harm but was not what I had been lead to believe I would get .\n\n\nA lab has told me there a 3 types of gold crowns/fillings Precious (60% noble metal), Semi Precious (25% noble metal) and Non Precious (less than 25% noble metal).\n\nI now have the option of another gold filling, from past experience I am cautious and have been unable to gain any information as to how I will know exactly what I am getting if I go for the gold option. I have tried speaking to various dentists and labs online and over the phone but no one can give me a straight answer or gets back to me.\n\nWhat is standard practice, should I receive something in writing stating what I am actually getting, otherwise I could be getting ripped off? That is paying for gold and getting gold colored. MattKW: Make clear your request before the crown is made, and ask the dentist to show you the itemised lab invoice. It should have at least a brand name on it - Google it. I have no problem with this - I never use semi- or non-precious anyway.  \nMany patients expect it to be a yellow gold alloy, but they are often white gold. \nAttached is the one my lab uses at 84% gold from this company here with screenshots of yellow and white gold variants. \nAnd noble content can mean other metals like palladium mixed with gold. A high noble is defined as at least 60% noble of which 40% must be gold. This is a very good layperson website here. High gold content will cost you more."

The pain is making her feel extremely fatigued.  I'm giving her regular pain relief.  The pain she describes as a dull ache with the occasional sharp pain.   I took her to the dentist on the 18th March and they  said it may be pain from her adult teeth on her lower jaw growing at an angle and pushing against her other teeth (no x-ray taken). One day after I picked my daughter up from school, one side of her face was physically swollen.  This has since gone.  She is still complaining of pain so I rang my GP.  Who triaged her over the phone!!! Said it was likely an infection.  And to get her seen by an emergency dentist!  Despite the dentist saying her teeth, gums ect were in perfect condition.  My mum mentioned that my cousin suffered terribly when his wisdom teeth were growing behind the scenes.  Could this possibly be what is happening to my daughter.  She got her first tooth at 4 months old so maybe she is further ahead than what the general tooth eruption charts on the net say.  I'm going to ring my dentist again on Monday and possibly see if they will do an x-ray.  Has anyone else experienced anything similar with their child? MattKW: Get Xrays and show us.

    "dialogue": "MDee: Hi,\n\nI would like to ask you for a help with my teeth problem which is a black tartar.\n\nI started to visit dental hygienist, she helps me to remove it, but after some time (3-4 months) it starts to appear again and it does not look good.\nGood thing about visiting her is also the fact, that she learns me how to clean my teeth properly in order to clean all the hardly accessible places. Well, I do not do it all properly yet, but since I started to use that new technique, in some places the black tartar is not appearing (or at least not in such a measure).\nThe disadvantage I spot is that the black tartar started to appear on the places where it was not before - for example, on the front side of the front upper teeth! I think it is because the dental hygiene procedure, where new grooves and scratches on the teeth are made, and where this tartar started to appear then. So it seems to be like visiting a dental hygiene helps me to remove the tartar on the one hand, but on the other hand, it creates new scratches as a new potential place for the tartar to appear.\n\nI was told there that my problem with tartar was caused in the past, that maybe as a child I used a lot of antibiotics and those killed the original, good, primary bacterias in my mouth and after that, the secondary bacterias were created\nas a substitution, which has the same function as the previous ones, but are not as good in quality, which results in the creating of that tartar.\n\nI was recommended to use a point brush (the one with the small, rounded head for getting a better access), interdental brushes, dental floss and also a mouthwash (Listerine – Advanced White – Mild Taste, which was introduced as better than the Listerines normally available in the stores, but what are the exact positives and negatives of this product, I do not know). I was also recommended to use a sonic brush, which can wash the hardly accessible places better. Well, I was not very consistent in following these recommendations, especially this time when I do not do it almost at all.\nAnyway, my question is, is it possible to clean my teeth in a way that every part will be properly cleaned? Because it seems quite hard for me to access all the places properly, also with that tools. And it takes a lot of time to use all that tools I was recommended to use.\n\nI have also read that black tartar is \"mostly a sign of underlying tooth decay or tooth decay that must be treated as quickly as possible.\" How to stop a tooth decay? So if it is true, then visiting a dental hygienist is not enough, because his/her work is mainly superficial and there is a problem with tooth decay which should be also solved. Am I right?\n\nThere was also said that \"The consumption of specific food items and drinks can add a stain on the tooth's natural enamel, making your teeth discolour.\" Can the black color of the tartar be caused by specific food, liquids, chemical elements?\n\nCan you help me, please? Is there any tooth brush with a special shape to get into hardly accessible areas of the teeth? For example, the lower front teeth. Can a usage of a water flosser help? What would you recommend? What are the possibilities to improve my health, the microflore in the mouth, so that this plaque will not creating? Is something like this possible? For example, by using some probiotics etc. Or should I only aim on the proper cleaning of my teeth, spend more time in the bathroom and hope that I will learn a perfect technique?\n\nThank you MattKW: Lots of questions, here goes...\n\nAntibiotics as a child...  doesn't work that way, total tosh. If you had massive doses of antibiotics it could kill lots of bacteria, good and bad, and then you would be in big gut trouble. Most often seen nowadays in immunocompromised patients.\nCertain antibiotics (tetracyclines) taken as a child would stain the developing teeth permanently. Tetras were mainly used for respiratory infections, e.g. bronchitis. They stopped giving them to children in the 70s(?) Still a useful drug, and has no effect on adult teeth.\nI am not aware of any magical ingredient in any Listerine mouthwash that will make your teeth whiter. I have emailed them today asking for the study which they reference on their website.\nThe only truly effective mouthwash is a chlorhexidine (0.12 or 0.2%) which has a substantive antibacterial action when applied to clean teeth, i.e. after bushing and interdental care.\nCleaning your teeth requires a manual or electric toothbrush (washing-machine action) and either flossing (if tight teeth) or interdental brushes (for large gaps). Sonic toothbrushes are silly, and I don't think much of Waterpiks.\nBlack tartar occurs when white tartar picks up pigment from bleeding gums, i.e. haemoglobin. Nothing to do with decay - you can have mountains of black tartar but no cavities in sight.\nSome foods will deposit a stain on the enamel, NOT embed in the enamel. Common culprits are tea, coffee, red wine. If you brush 2x daily then you will minimise these superficial stains. These are harmless stains, and do not need to be removed unless they are unsightly to you.

From the information I have, the sonic toothbrush is considered to be better.\n\n2. That Listerine mouthwash I was recommended to use in order to kill the bacteria. I think  the reason was that, not the whitening effect (although it is mentioned as an effect on the bottle). The chlorhexidine mouthwash you mentioned, so, do you recommend it to use it regularly (well, in the recommended amount of time, I found out that it is a period of 2 weeks) or is it something which is not as necessary when dealing with a black tartar? And can using such a mouthwash also have a negative impact on the good microflora in the mouth? \n\n4. So, if it is as you say, then I need to stop the gums to bleed and then the black tartar will not create. But the white one will be still there. How to get rid of it? I think it is quite hard for me to access all the surface of the teeth. And actually, the black tartar started to create on the front side of the upper teeth, which I think I wash quite a lot. Why that happened? There should not be the tartar, whether white or black. Isn't it because of the new scratches caused by dental hygiene procedure, as I mentioned before? That it creates a new \"hiding place\" for the bacteria? \n\nThank you.

Nonna69: Yes thats the stuff the dentist put underneath the implant (is this acknowledgement that implant has gone wrong?)\nI have no xrays taken after the implants and crowns were placed.\nI want to understand if it is common to have implants filled afterwards, also if there was a better procedure for bridging the gap between my gum and tooth as this just seems like a temporary fix."

    "dialogue": "eve072011: Last week, I was eating some popcorn when the top of my back molar came off. It is about a medium sized piece and I can now see behind it, my wisdom teeth is growing horizontally, pushing against it and causing it to have decay and eventually break.\n\nI went to the dentist today who has said I have two options. I can leave it or have it removed. She said a filling will not work on this space / area. \n\nI don't know what to do as I do not want the tooth removed if I don't have to bit also very worried about it getting infected / lots of food gets stuck in it of I leave it. It doesn't hurt but she did say it has signs of decay. \n\nAny help please MattKW: I would have to see Xrays of that tooth, the wisdom teeth, and of your lower teeth on same side. An OPG would be fine. Usually it is the wisdom tooth that is removed, and then the adjacent tooth would be repaired. eve072011: Hi there, thank you for responding. I have asked for my x ray pictures so if they send them, I will attach them. She said the wisdom tooth is fine and as it is at a horizontal angle (it is growing sideways out the gum) it doesn't need to come out. It had however caused decay on the 2nd molar which has lost the back part of the tooth. \n\nI am concerned about taking the tooth out as I have heard it can make the molar above it grow lower, teeth can move etc. \nI am also concerned if I leave it though and it ends up getting infected.\n\nWould the dentist offer leaving it is as an option if this could happen? \n\nI am really stressed about what to do. \nMany thanks MattKW: So, the wisdom tooth has caused the decay, and is growing horizontally? That's 2 good reasons to extract it. eve072011: She doesn't want to remove the wisdom tooth, she said she is going to leave that in. It's the 2nd molar which they are saying to remove. \nAre you saying to also get the wisdom tooth removed ? \nThank you MattKW: I don't have Xrays to see, but if it is lying horizontally, then it will never upright itself and will just be a nuisance. eve072011: Thank you.

I'm planning on getting an onlay, but I also need to remove impacted wisdom teeth about 5 months later (I can't do it now because of a certain medication that shouldn't be taken in case of oral surgeries). \nThe problem is, my dentist warned me that it's risky because wisdom tooth extraction can damage an onlay. I'm pretty surprised, as we are talking about 1st molar, not 2nd. How likely is this scenario? MattKW: I wouldn't even worry a patient about this distant risk. Certainly the 2nd molar could be damaged despite best intentions, but not the 1st.\nCurious,... what is the medication that worries you, and what are you going to do when the extraction of the wisdoms arrives? Stop the meds? Mukros: Thank you. It's called Oralair and is used for allergy immunotherapy treatment, the course is 4-5 months. It shouldn't be taken until any bruises or wounds in the mouth heal up completely, as per instruction. I'm not worried about possible urgent extraction, my wisdom teeth don't hurt or anything, it's just that I've been reminded by yet another dentist that they should be taken out, so I guess I'll finally do it this year. MattKW: Ah, yes. It's not that it has a systemic effect that would interfere with OS, but rather that since it is dissolved in the mouth, we don't want it to get in a wound. If necessary, you could stop it at any time, have extractions, wait for initial healing (~2 wks) then resume."

MattKW: Nothing is guaranteed forever, so it is reasonable to give patients the best approximation. And it's not always the filling per se that fails, but may be an associated cusp fracture. So, composites 7 years, amalgams 12 years, crowns 15-20 years, .... Many factors affect the longevity - size, shape, depth, chewing forces, front tooth, back tooth,... \ne.g. I have 6 fillings in my teeth. The 2 front composites are small and have been there  since 1975, the only change is mild discolouration. The 4 back amalgams  (chewing pressures) had been placed about 1970. In 2 of those teeth I had a cusp fracture in 1995, and another in 2000 - one was rebuilt with amalgam, the other with composite; still going OK."

    "title": "Severe tooth pain",
    "dialogue": "Finegold: Hi.\nApproximately 5 days ago I woke up with tooth pain focused on one side of my teeth. I assumed this would only last a few hours, so I ignored it. Eventually, this led to severe tooth pain, a headache, and pain in my ear. It was hard to localize this pain exactly but I think it came from a upper tooth in the right back side of my mouth.\n\nI went to the doctor three times. The first two times they couldn't diagnose the issue even after many x-ray images. On the third visit, they removed 3 fillings, did freeze tests, and sedated me to attempt to diagnose it. After this, they still couldn't diagnose it. They then put temporary fillings on my teeth and let me go home.\n\nI went home that day without treatment but was sedated in my teeth. After the sedation went away it didn't hurt the same way. I felt that the pain from the upper tooth had gone away (they had removed the filling on it). But now there is a pain in the backmost bottom tooth whenever I bite down on it (they also removed the filling on this), however, this pain is much more bearable (except when biting really hard).\n\nEven after this, I still get a lot of pain in my right tooth (which hurts just as badly as before, but this is rare). I am not sure exactly where it's coming from or why, but it just starts hurting severely. I don't know what is going on, and I don't think the dentists know what is going on either. This is why I'm asking around hopefully to learn and to the pain.\n\nCurrently, I have a scheduled root canal treatment on the bottom backmost tooth and normal fillings on the other two teeth. But I am afraid that if I fill that tooth then the pain will remain or come back even more severely.\n\nI will include a link to the x-ray images taken:   \n\n\n\nI have colored 3 teeth on the left of the panoramic image (which is the right side of my mouth). All the 3 colors are where the filling was removed. The red is where the pain is now when I bite down. The blue is where the pain was coming from before (I think, it was a bit hard to localize).\n\nThese are my symptoms:\nSevere pain in my right teeth (hard to localize)\nPain on one tooth when biting down (and severe pain if I bite down hard).\nHard to sleep, waking up multiple times at night.\nPain coming and going in random intervals\n\nI appreciate any comment and can clarify anything if needed. \nThank you MattKW: Other tests should be explored besides simple Xrays: percussion, perio probing, ethyl chloride or CO2 (cold), electronic pulp test, palpation, FracFinder, and transillumination.\n\nPain in the ear is usually referred from a lower tooth.\nPain on biting usually indicates a fracture, hence a FracFinder and transillumination.\nif I only had the Xrays to guide me, I would select the red tooth as most likely. It is the largest filling on that side of your mouth, and has a suspicious dark area underneath.\nAs an absolute last resort, I would give a long-lasting anaesthetic (bupivacaine) for either the upper or lower teeth on the affected side, and tell the patient to try and set off the pain again. It's the least reliable method but sometimes helps.\nI attach a file that I give to my students.\n\nOnce you start having fillings replaced willy-nilly, it only \"muddies the water\" because now you have disturbed 3 teeth and maybe set off other symptoms. Temporary fillings should ideally be ZnO/eugenol-based e.g. Kalzinol or IRM, (not simply Cavit); the eugenol will help settle pain. My money's on the lower molar. Let us know how you get on.

Hey, first of all, thanks a lot for the extensive answer and for the sheet provided.\n\nFrom looking at it now, before, I felt like I was getting spontaneous pain, which suggests irreversible pulpitis. But after a while, I felt like the pain was only coming when I drank water, or breathed in cold air, but would still stay for 10-30 minutes. Note that I am under painkillers: 1 etoricoxib (90 mg every 24 hours) and 2 panadol (500 mg every 6 hours). So, while that might be skewing the pain results, this would suggest reversible pulpitis, since it's only triggered.\nTo note: the pain was tremendous, it would give me jaw and ear pain, and it would give me a headache as well. But essentially my guess is that it was some kind of pulpitis.\n\nYesterday I went to the dentist, and they filled in two teeth in the upper teeth (whose fillings were removed the week before that because I thought the pain was coming from there). During these fillings, it hurt a lot in my bottom rightmost tooth (which has temporary fillings) when they had to apply water or applied cold. The dentist even applied cold to the bottom rightmost tooth, and it would hurt a lot depending on which side the water was applied from, and I heard the dentist say \"pulpitis\". But they didn't have time to further investigate it, so they left it and told me they would transfer me to a specialist.\n\nToday I woke up and the water does not seem to affect my tooth anymore, all the pain just seems to have gone away and I am not sure why. My last 2 panadol were 17 hours ago and 1 etoricoxib was 24 hours ago, so my guess is that it isn't the painkillers doing their job. I'm a bit afraid that I now have pulp necrosis, if it was pulpitis that I had (which has lasted 2-3 weeks), but I am not sure if it's supposed to hurt or not, because it does not seem to. Is necrosis supposed to hurt? Should I just ignore my previous pain if it truly has gone away? How can I check if I have tooth necrosis now?\n\nThank you\n\n\nSome notes (that may or may not be relevant):\n- The right backmost tooth still feels weird when I tab it compared to the other teeth. It's not as bad as before when it would hurt, now its just a different feeling.\n- The dentists haven't done anything directly to by bottom rightmost tooth, like RCT or something like that, they only took a bunch of x-ray images, removed 3 fillings, filled 2 fillings, and checked a couple of times with freeze and water where the pain was coming from.\n- I have now gone to the dentist four times. The first time I told them I had pain in my right backmost tooth. The second time I told them it was an upper tooth that was the source of the pain. The third time upper tooth again, and they were trying to investigate it. The fourth time I felt like the pain was coming from my right backmost tooth (which I think is where the pain truly comes from now). Essentially I feel like I have had some sort of referred pain, but I have always answered truthfully when they would ask me questions. This might have been annoying for them to deal with. But the first time I went to them was with pain in my right backmost tooth, which they even gave me chlorhexidine to treat with.\n- I have a slight feeling that the 2 bottom wisdom teeth are coming, because I feel ripples in the skin in the bottom left and right of my mouth.\n- My lips on the right side feel a bit weird (like they are scarred, when compared to my lips on the left side) MattKW: Well, let's wait and see a bit longer. Good luck."

But the last one(\nwho placed my crown) said that everything is fine. \nHere is my question: 1) does the quality of the last x-ray good enough to evaluate the quality of fitting-issues of my crown?: 2) Is it possible for each x-ray of same area to look different just like my last x-ray vs. the other three x-rays? Thanks for your expertise! Dr M: The quality of the last x-ray is a bit poor and the ill-fitting margins cannot be fully evaluated on this x-ray. This discrepancy could be due to the angle at which the x-ray was taken. I agree with the other dentists that the crown should be replaced. datamatters: Thanks for your reply! May I ask you questions? 1) Given such a margin as indicated in the first three x-rays, would a normal dentist be able to see that margin using naked eyes or using dental loupes ?; 2) Given the poor quality, would it be reasonable for a dentist to re-take another x-ray after the last x-ray? Thanks! Dr M: You can sometimes feel the gap with a dental probe, but it might be possible to view it with dental loupes or even the naked eye. If the quality of the x-ray is poor, I always try and take another x-ray in order to make an accurate diagnoses. datamatters: Many thanks for your reply! Like I mentioned, all other dentists suggested a replacement whereas my dentist who actually placed the crown keep arguing NO replacement needed based on the last x-ray which I believe looks not precise enough. That makes it hard for me to smoothly communicate with my dentist. What would be my rights and options in this situation I'm facing? Thanks! Dr M: I would mention to this dentist, that you received more than one second opinion, that disagrees with his assessment. Unfortunately if you go ahead with treatment at another dentist, the costs will be on you for the crown replacement. honestdoc: The dentist who placed the crown should redo the crown at no cost to you.  This happens to all of us dentists.  The 2nd molar is very difficult to access and to obtain accurate moldings (impressions).  If the dentist uses the digital scanner, that scanner is not accurate.  Without telling the dentist how to do the job, you may ask to take multiple impressions.   Otherwise you may have a case with the licensing Board. datamatters: Thanks for your reply, honestdoc! Do you think that the last radiograph alone (without regard to other x-rays) indicates that margins of the crown is reasonably good enough? Thanks!! honestdoc: I only see 1 x-ray.  The margin on the Mesial surface (towards the midline of your mouth next to adjacent molar) looks open.  As long as you keep the area clean, you should be fine short term (months). datamatters: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\n\nhonestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI only see 1 x-ray.

Many thanks for your reply! Are you able to see all the 4 x-rays in the attached pdf document? I wanted to know whether the very last x-ray indicates reasonably good margin of the crown. This is because the very last radiograph is the one my dentist(who placed my crown) took. Thanks! honestdoc: Have your dentist review all of the x-rays.  The last one covered the open margin due to angulation.  That is not an excuse to leave it. datamatters: do you know where / how I check my xray for possible manipulation?

If so, can you advise how the negotiating process went.  I would be offering cash for the services as the work goes along.\n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated. Since no one can help me, perhaps my further research can help others.  I have purchased dental insurance from my Medicare Advantage insurance provider and will immediately have 50% coverage for the needed work up to a total of $2000 for the year.,  Furthermore, since my dentist office is in network the price of each crown has dropped by over $400.  With the premiums I will pay the net savings through the insurance coverage saves me $1600 and the reduction in price saves another $2000. MattKW: Do you have X-rays to show us? When you are considering post/pins/core build-ups, then the teeth are often in poor shape and perhaps spending money on teeth with poor prognoses would be better off towards a different treatment plan.\nAs for negotiating with dentists, I would be wary of what you might be getting; generally a higher price will get you better work. \n\nLet's say you need PFM crowns (Porcelain-Fused-to-Metal). The metal can be of different grades - non-precious $, semi-precious $$, and precious $$$. The better quality metal will bind better to the porcelain, will give a better look to the crown, and not cause gum irritation. I only ever offer precious quality - there is no negotiation.\nI could cut costs by sending my lab work overseas to SE Asia, but quality is often poor. I'd rather find a good local lab who do things properly and with whom I can communicate well on technical matters.\nMaybe a cheap dentist will work faster in order to value quantity of turnover rather than more time on quality workmanship. If I do a quick, rubbishy job that last 5 years rather than a more expensive quality job that lasts 15-20 years, maybe you might be willing for this trade-off, but replacing crowns in 5 years will be harder to redo. It's not like buying cheap tyres for your care that only last 1 year rather than better quality that last 3 years - tyres are easily replaceable, crowns are not.\nI'd suggest you talk to family, friends, workplace colleagues to find quality dentists. Then take copies of your current quote with Xrays for consultation and quotes."

    "dialogue": "sunsavior66: When I was young, there was a period of time where I did not take good care of my teeth. Next thing I knew, my dentist was telling me that I had multiple cavities that needed to be filled, and I got many of them filled.\n\nFast forward to my 21 year old self and I don’t eat on my left side due to pain and sensitivity from cavities that were filled and my far top right molar (2nd molar) was extracted.\n\nBut my life seems to want to get worse at 22 as I have now discovered a hole on the side of my tooth…similar to the one I got removed….. right next to now removed tooth (1st molar on top right). On top of that, I think I have found another big cavity on the side of my tooth on the 1st molar on the bottom right (metal taste when i run my tongue along the tooth and felt with a dentist tool) AND I still don’t eat on my left side due to sensitivity.\n\nThe reason why I got the first tooth extracted was because all the cavities I have gotten done have only seem to make my teeth worse (and have been no help), because my sister had a bad experience with the root canal, and because of the placement of the cavity. \nThe extraction healed really nicely and the process wasn’t even bad. It was the only thing that stop the pain for obvious reasons.\nI would LOVE to extract these molars on the right and the 2 bottom molars on the left that cause the most pain but I know that I cannot. Even if I did, I know I would have to get implants on at least some, and I do not have the funds to pay for implants that are not covered by insurance.\n\nFor the past couple years, I’ve been flossing, brushing twice a day and still I am plagued by my earlier teenage years.\n\n\nWhat would be the easiest way to deal with all of this??? I am probably going to get a second opinion after my visit because all my dentist really does is shame me and my past decisions but I won’t even be able to go to my dentist until the next month.\n\nJust to note, I have not gotten my wisdom teeth pulled, but they have never caused me any pain or concern.\n\nPlease help!! MattKW: Unfortunately, dentistry is a bit like smash repairs for your car; we can't make it as good as natural tooth, and nothing we do is guaranteed forever. Extraction of back teeth sounds all very well to some patients, but inevitably leads to other issues: can't chew well, can't replace molars with dentures (uncomfortable), start putting pressure on remaining teeth (premolars etc) which aren't built to take heavy biting pressures.\nSo, yes, go to another dentist and see what can be diagnosed and proposed. Ask friends, family, workmates for suggestions. Ask your existing dentist for copies of your records, including Xrays, and get them sent to the new dentist well in advance of your appt.\nGenerally wisdom teeth are only going to be a source of problems at some stage in your life, but I don't have the benefit of your Xrays.\nGood luck."

Some people might quote low in order to get your interest; others might quote high in order to cover all possible problems.

A couple months ago I started getting intermittent extreme pressure sensitivity in a tooth, bottom front. I think the number is 26. While some days I have no pain or sensitivity at all, other days it hurts to talk, swallow, or do anything that causes contact with the front of the tooth (but not the back). Occasionally, but infrequently, when it is doing particularly badly, the tooth seems to pulse with pain without any pressure at all. The area around the gum line and on the edge of the tooth closest to the midline of my mouth seem to have the most sensitivity. The tooth is not unusually sensitive to cold or heat - just pressure. None of the surrounding teeth have any issues.\n\nThe tooth sticks out a bit from the others despite invisalign treatment I had a couple years ago. I have been really consistent about wearing a retainer at night but the tooth has been moving anyway to overlap and come to the front of the tooth next to it (number 25), and I feel quite a bit of pressure on the tooth when I wear my retainer. However the tooth has no contact with upper teeth when I bite down - I can't even make it touch the top teeth if I try. The tooth is not discolored and looks completely normal. Advil and tylenol do help with the pain but I would not say they make it manageable when it is at its worst.\n\nWent to my general dentist maybe a month and a half ago. She took xrays, observed the tooth, and tested for cold response. She could not find a problem and recommended trying tooth paste for sensitive teeth, which I have been using since her recommendation without noticeable success. A couple weeks ago, over a holiday weekend, the pain was very bad and I went to a different general dentist that was open on the weekend. He conducted a similar exam and also could not find anything wrong with the tooth via xray, cold test, or observation. He recommended I see an endodontist.\n\nI saw the endodontist last week. Like the dentists, he could not find anything wrong with the tooth after conducting xrays (some kind of more sophisticated xray that created a 3d picture of my teeth) and cold tests. He thought perhaps I had bruised the tooth through some trauma (that I don't remember) and maybe my retainer was causing it to be repeatedly aggravated. He recommended I stop wearing my lower retainer for the time being and check with my orthodontist. He recommended against a root canal because he thought there was a good chance that it would not resolve the pain.\n\nWent to my orthodontist today, and she has no idea. She made a new impression of my lower teeth and is going to make a lower retainer that reflects the shift in this tooth that has occurred since my treatment ended, but she doesn't really seem to think that the retainer is the problem.\n\nBased on some advice I found on the internet regarding bruised teeth, for the last few days I have been really consistently eating only very soft food and avoiding speaking as much as possible. I have also stopped wearing the lower retainer at night (I still wear the upper), but despite these efforts I feel like the pain is returning again after having taken a hiatus for the last couple days.\n\nI am at a loss for what to do, so here I am on an internet forum asking for help generally. I feel like I am going from specialist to specialist that just keep telling me that they have no idea and its not something in their area.

Thanks in advance MattKW: If you find a decent dentist, then they're not out to embarrass you. I used to see drug addicts during rehab and they were some of the most grateful and rewarding patients. For your first visit, just get an examination and Xrays. If time allows, they should give you a full discussion and treatment plan with costs. I sometimes have to leave that to a the second appointment. It's the chance for you to discuss how you see your needs and fear. If you want to get a second opinion, then you have the right to ask for copies of your records, including Xrays) to get a 2nd opinion elsewhere. I have no problem with such patients - it makes good sense.\nLooking at your pics, I can see that there has been some neglect; I would need xrays and better photos for fuller idea, but as you say, no toothaches so that's a good sign. It does look like you might drink a lot of soft drinks or sports drinks? because the tips of your teeth look too sharp (erosion). If that's true, then one of the best and simplest things to do is change over to plain tap water. Long term erosion is a real bugger to treat, so better to prevent. Good luck."

    "title": "Desperately searching for a solution, but cannot seem to acquire treatment",
    "dialogue": "MyIncisorSucks: Hi, first, thank you for reading this ridiculously long summary. I'm in severe discomfort and cannot express how much I appreciate any advice. \n\nProblem: \n\nThe back of my top right incisor eroded and has lost a noticeable amount of volume. This is yielding speech problems with strident sounds and it's - literally - beginning to drive me crazy because I can't seem to acquire treatment. Additionally, I feel light pain under pressure or extreme temperatures. \n\nCatalyst: \n\nI had a deep bite and my bottom incisor lightly damaged the back of the top one - resulting in the initial damage that slowly expanded across the back of the tooth. I also supported the damage with a horrendous diet - energy drinks galore. \n\nContext on the dental professionals: \n\nI repeatedly visited the same dental practice, but was never able to meet with the same dentist twice because they kept leaving. The lack of continuity in my treatment means that nobody was able to see the initial problem escalate in real-time. Additionally, my orthodontist has not been communicating with the dental practice whatsoever - leading to a somewhat aimless treatment without a real end-goal or game plan. \n\nDetails about me: \n\n- 31, male \n- B.A. in English\n- Writer that works in sales\n- No lingering health problems whatsoever\n- I don't drink or smoke\n\nTimeline:\n\nMarch, 2020 - Discomfort level: 2/10. I noticed a small divot forming where at the intersection between my top central incisors and my gums. It was pretty much a nonissue, but created a slight whistle on my 's' sounds that was somewhat annoying. I visited the dentist and they said that it wasn't worth fixing because the damage was minimal and they didn't want to remove healthy enamel. I agreed because it seemed logical and left without addressing the issue.\n\nNovember, 2020 - Discomfort level: 5/10. The damage slowly spread across the back of the tooth throughout the subsequent eight months. 'S' sounds yielded a stronger whistle and harder syllables - d, t, - were becoming somewhat problematic when spoken in rapid succession - e.g. words like 'text,' 'didn't,' 'ordered,' etc. I returned to the dentist in search of a solution and they agreed that the damage was clearly evident and advised that I get aligners. Nonetheless, my dentist was convinced that the whistling 's' sound was due to uneven bottom teeth. I disagreed with this assessment and sought a second opinion. The second dentist also recommended aligners so I decided to move forward with them. \n\nJune, 2021 - Discomfort level: 6/10. Aligner treatment begins. I told my orthodontist that correcting my overbite without addressing the damaged tooth seemed like a bad idea because it would stack an array of new changes with my teeth onto the existing problem. He said that I'd be fine and we mutually agreed to move forward. \n\nNovember, 2021 - Discomfort level: 7/10. Fortunately, I dove headfirst into an insanely meticulous hygiene routine and successfully stopped the enamel from receding further. Regardless, my teeth began to expand outward as part of the deep bite's correction and speaking was becoming progressively difficult. All strident sounds - including Ls, at this point - were problematic. I also began to feel slight pain when the tooth was pressured or subjected to cold temperatures. I expressed immense discontent, but my orthodontist said that we could not address the damage until the aligner treatment was complete. I agreed to continue, but was beginning to panic about how invasive the speech problem had become. \n\nMarch, 2022 - Discomfort level: 7/10. My initial aligner treatment was complete. The deep bite was corrected and I progressed onto refinements. I reiterated my discomfort to my orthodontist, but he basically shrugged and wasn't sure about how to fix the issue. The entire problem left him perplexed throughout the majority of our interactions. During this discussion, he heavily implied that it might be a mental problem. I cannot emphasize how much I disagree with this notion. I noticed the initial damage on my tooth immediately, felt - and witnessed - the damage continue to spread across across a long duration of time, and felt my speech problem grow in correlation. My wife also monitored the situation and, additionally, co-workers and friends also made unprovoked comments about a weird hitch in my speech that I occasionally failed to hide. \n\nRegardless, I have maintained that I am NOT a dental professional, nor will I act as an armchair dentist and sought treatment from a speech pathologist. The speech pathologist administered verbal and physical tests that both tracked with my complaint. Specifically, this confirmed my issue with strident sounds and also flagged a slight muscle reflex on the left side of my tongue that indicated that I was compensating for the lack of surface area on the upper right incisor. In other words, I was making contact with the left tooth when producing strident sounds, but not the right one.\n\n7/2022 - Discomfort level: 7/10. I returned to my orthodontist, expressed my continued discontent, and left without any game plan. At this point, I feel like I've been on a multi-year, $8,000 dental odyssey to nowhere. \n\n9/2022 - Discomfort level: 8/10. My discomfort increased simply because it WON'T STOP. The hitch in my speech is attached to every word, of every sentence, of every discussion throughout every interaction in my day-to-day life. I began to squirm and went to a completely new dentist in a desperate attempt to fix the back of my tooth. The dentist added volume to the outer portion of the tooth - providing small relief - but refuses to touch the primary erosion - e.g. the intersection where my incisors meet my gums - until my aligner refinements are finished. \n\n11/2022 - Discomfort level: 9/10. I NEED HELP. This issue is akin to having a thorn in your side; it doesn't hurt that much, but the pain grows intolerable when left unaddressed. I feel like I am speaking with a single front tooth. I literally don't make contact with my upper right incisor AT ALL when speaking. I want to reiterate that NONE of the dental or orthodontic professionals have addressed the erosion on the back of the tooth. None of them. This is seriously beginning to mess with me simply because of how long I have been forced to cope with it and I don't believe that my dentist or orthodontist are grasping how much a mental toll this is creating. I am constantly course correcting my speech and rarely feel 100% present in my daily conversations. Speaking is not effortless; it's a chore. My aligner treatment isn't solving the problem; it's worsening it. My dentist won't touch my issue without the treatment being completed, but I cannot continue with this issue in perpetuity any longer. \n\nIn summary: I called out a problem and was told to ignore it. I called out the problem again and was told to get aligners against my own judgement. I got aligners, but the orthodontist told me that the speech issue might be mental. I visited a speech pathologist and confirmed my problems. I returned to my orthodontist and was told to continue treatment. I feel like I am being dismissed and the severity of my problem is wildly unacknowledged. \n\nWhat do I do here? Who do I see? What do I say? What are the magic words that can convince someone to help me replace the missing volume on the back of my tooth so that I can end this nightmare and return to normalcy? Two years ago, I couldn't fathom such miniscule damage becoming this severe and I'm truly going to have a nervous breakdown if I cannot find an imminent solution. \n\n\n\nPhotos: Dr M: Good day\n\nHas anyone discussed crowning the tooth in question, with posssible root canal treatment( if prep risks involving the nerve)? This would add body or volume to the tooth, since you design it digitally, but you might then need to start with an adjusted treatment plan of aligners, which would increase the costs. This is because the initial treatment plan was based on how your teeth were intitially. MyIncisorSucks: Hi, thank you so much for your insight. During my last dental visit in September, the new dentist mentioned the possibility of adding a crown, but wanted to wait until aligner treatment was complete prior to exploring the option further. If I have to travel this route, I absolutely will. Nonetheless, I'm shocked - and admittedly frustrated - at how this evolved from ignoring the problem to getting a crown.\n\nForgive my ignorance, but is something as simple as adding resin to the indented area on the tooth feasible? Dr M: Yes you can, although resin fillings on the smooth surface of a front tooth tend to dislodge quite often. MyIncisorSucks: Thank you for clarifying. Out of curiosity, does the damage to my right incisor look like something that I should be concerned about going forward? Speech issues aside, a substantial portion of the back of the tooth disappeared throughout a span of a couple of years and I fear that it might be symptomatic of a bigger problem. Dr M: It might be related to the abnormal top and bottom incisor relationship prior to the aligner therapy. This could have been fixed with the ortho treatment, but I would suggest keeping an eye on it after the treatment is done. If it continues to wear, I would consider a crown or bite plate to sleep with at night."

The veneer will make my teeth look longer, but I am unsure if this will look disturbing. \n Any dentists or experienced people that can tell me yes or no? \n\nDuring the consult my dentist placed some fillings on the receding gum to show me how it will look. I completely forgot to ask him to take a photo while I was just normally smiling and therefore I still don’t know if it will look funny or not. \n\nAttached photos of how my teeth look now, and how they will look with veneers.\n\nMy other option is to just keep the fillings and renew them once they discolour. I would love to find a different option for the fillings as they change colour quite quickly. Dr M: Good day\n\nHas the underlying  cause of the receding gums been addressed? It does not help patching an area with veneers, only to have to replace it once a year, once the recession progresses. Veneers would indeed make your teeth appear slightly longer. But if this would be non-aesthetic is a matter of perspective. I would also maybe consider gingival augmentation procedures such as flap repositioning surgeries, which might cover up the defect, but only if the underlying course has been addressed. Marije: Thank you very much for your reply. This is a very good point. The last week I’ve been diving deeper into receding gum and realised that my gum is already very high up for my age, I’m only 31. I start feeling it too, so it’s indeed a good idea to first tackle this problem before looking into veneers. \nThanks a lot!"

    "dialogue": "Sinus problems: Hi all\n\nI extracted a first upper molar 3 months ago, due to longterm root infection from two failed root canal treatements at younger age(curtently 28). This is the only tooth i have extracted in my life. Next week i have my appointment to check the status of the bone before proceeding with implant or bone graft. The extraction perfortated the sinus and due to the fact an apical lesion was already there, there is some bone gap above the extracted tooth, as the days went by i can feel that part of face tilting and when i am outside i can feel cold air strong like my face has missing bone. I think i developed TMJ because of the gap and have pain in weird spots. Anyways, to cut the long story short, i will propably need to wait for an implant, and hopefully next week the dentist will start me on the bone graft(i wonder why he left me 3 months like that, but he insisted to wait 3 months for the bone to heal). \n\nThe tooth shifting didnt bother me initially until i realised how much it affected my bite and jaw, dentist did a flipper tooth some weeks ago, which didnt fit well and said it will time to adjust, i said i cant bite because it is too high, he didnt fix it and went to another dentist which made a proper fitting one with multiple adjustments to test it with better gap grip few days ago. This and other dentist adviced me to wear this so the teeth dont move in the empty space. Given the fact i have this weak bone issue, will this deteriorate the situation of TMJ or help me ?  \n\nI feel more confident with the partial and like my face feels full, but when i take it out, i feel really bad. I take it before sleep and clean it with solution every morning, sometimes i take it off during the day. Should i keep wearing this daily till i get the implant. Also, if they proceed on bone graft, what other solutions apart partial are to put on ? I am getting paranoid about losing my bone, i eat well, take supplements, but the bone doesnt seem to get stronger. :C"

It only hurts when I bite it.. but that should be normal. I looked it up on internet, and it looks like pericoronitis but apparently that is supposed to hurt etc? \n\nI was at my private dentist 3 weeks ago and they said that top ones are entirely out and bottom ones will have plenty of space to grow and it shouldn’t cause any issues. \n\nI’m 21, not smoking or drinking. I have diabetes.\n\nThanks to everyone! Dr M: I would give it more time for that piece of gum tissue to disappear, especially if your wisdom teeth only recently erupted. It can cause pain and discomfort at a later stage, but then the piece of gum can be surgically removed.\n\nAs for the scratching of the gum where the wisdom is supposed to erupt-it is normal for it to itch from time to time. I would be careful creating any wounds in your mouth with hands that might not be clean all the time. This has the potential of causing problems. Rather see if you can rinse with a disinfectant or numbing mouth rinse. This might help with the itchy feeling."

    "dialogue": "Greg9840: When my son was 2, around a year ago, he had bad decay on his 4 top front teeth, possibly due to a genetic disorder.  At the time, we felt that silver diamine fluoride (SDF) was the best option because he was too young to sit still for drilling 4 teeth.  The SDF made his teeth black, which the dentist had warned us about.  Now that he is older, he is complaining about having black teeth.  What are my options for fixing them?  The dentist said his teeth are very malformed and thin, and because the SDF makes teeth extra brittle, drilling is not an option.  She said his teeth could break.  What are my options?  We definitely don't want to spend money on veneers or crowns since these are baby teeth that will be falling out over the next few years. I was reading about \"opaquers\" online, but I'm not sure how that would work or help. Dr M: Good day\n\nHow old is your son now? You can get preformed crowns that they sometimes place over front teeth in children in order to give a more aesthetic appearance, although the bonding with the baby teeth might be a bit compromised, due to poor enamel quality. Greg9840: He is 3 now. I forgot to mention in my post that we already tried resin crowns and one has fallen off twice within one month, so the durability seems very poor.  I'd prefer to just cover the front of the teeth with opaquer and bonding if at all possible, or some other method. Dr M: You can try, although the bonding might also be compromised due to the quality of the enamel on the tooth. Unfortunately bonding to these type of primary teeth is very difficult."

The LR7 is impacted which is coming in at an angle which has caused significant bone loss in the area where you are getting food stuck. It would be an idea to book a periodontal exam with your dentist or a deep clean, as advised LR7 to be removed as it is causing decay on LR6.\"\n\nThe X-ray is included. Dr M: Usually for any periodontal related issues, it is best to go for an evaluation with a periodontist. He will also most likely advise you to remove the impacted tooth. bledisloe: FYI @ChrisX - I have periodontitis and 2 impacted wisdom teeth, both on the left side. My periodontist has advised me to have them removed. Dr M: Impacted wisdom, especially partially impacted wisdom teeth, often lead to areas where food gets trapped and then can cause localized areas of bone loss, and also cavity formation on the adjacent teeth. bledisloe: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\talso cavity formation on the adjacent teeth. That's the reason my periodontist gave me. I asked him specifically why they had to be removed since they've been there causing me no discomfort etc for, I don't know, 40 plus years!\n\nOne of mine is horizontal but both are fully impacted (non visible)"

    "dialogue": "Teeth Problems: Hi,\n\nI am not sure if this is in the correct area of the forum. Apologies if it is not.\n\nI had two root canals done many years ago. One of the crowns of the root canal fell off and due to costs (and personal reasons) - I did not immediately rush to the dentist for months. I felt no pain from it. So unfortunately, an infection formed in the site. By the time I got to the dentist, the tooth had deteriorated to the point that it could not hold another crown. So they had to extract the tooth. To make matters worse, the infection had spread to the other root canal in front of the tooth. So I was referred to an endodontist to have it re-treated.\n\n7 months after the retreatment, I was called to do a follow-up to see how the area has healed. To my surprise, neither the extraction site nor the retreated root canal removed the infection. I've now been referred to an Oral Surgeon and they are going to remove the remaining root canal and do a biopsy (I'm really scared about this).\n\nMy question to the dental experts on here is - have there been cases where an infection did not go away even after extraction and a retreatment of a root canal? If so - why doesn't it go away? Is this a sign of something worse? The dentist, nor the endodontist, nor the oral surgeon know what it going on. The oral surgeon says its a low chance of cancer, but I'm still terrified. I am attaching my dental x-ray to see if maybe that will assist in reviewing it?\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated! Dr M: Good day\n\nThere could be a host of factors leading to this situation. The root canal treated tooth could have a crack in, leading to persistent infection. There could be missed canals the tooth, which also might lead to infection. All of this would have been investigated by your endodontist, I am sure.\nA lot of times, chronic infection, can lead to the formation of granulation tissue. This does not clear up by itself, even if a source of infection was cleared. The granulation tissue itself has to be debrided and removed. This can be done by the oral surgeon. Usually any tissue removed by the oral surgeon is sent for a biopsy, but I agree that it sounds like a low risk of cancer. Most likely the lesions just needs to debrided in order for healing to take place."

We set up the appointment to take care of her cavities before she went back to her university on the  east coast (we live in CA). As soon as week later her entire left side was in pain. She had to stop eating on that side because of the pain. Thinking she just needed an adjustment and with her busy school schedule we decided as soon as she had a break she would see a dentist up there to get a quick adjustment of high spots. When she went in there were not many high spots so the dentist took an x-ray of that left side and discovered a tooth was not completely filled, had an overhang and a cavity still in there. Also, the adjacent tooth worked on may possibly have a cavity too. That was the exact area that was painful when she flossed. Here is the dilemma, the dentist said she needs the filling removed and redone. The cost to do that is $427. I paid a lot to the initial dentist because the cavities exceeded my coverage. She doesn't come home until December and cannot get it redone by the dentist that did it wrong in the first place. She's in pain, her jaw hurts from eating only on the right side. I want a refund to pay for the dentist up there to redo that filling. The office has not reached back to me after discussing the situation with the office person. Prior to this I had called them and spoke to the dentist about the pain and she recommended she take a over the counter numbing  medication but now that I know it's because of a bad filling that is not appropriate.

Been wearing a bite splint at night for years, but am having pain in my jaw nevertheless\n\nThe situation right now:\n- my lower jar on the right hurts almost constantly (seems to be a little dependent on my position/posture)\n- the joint on the right hurts and sometimes even cracks, which is new\n- the pains seems to radiate to my ear, neck and shoulders\n\nThis would point to TMJ, but:\n\n- the tooth became extremely sensitive to cold/heat during the last few days (as far as I can tell near the gum line and especially on the top where the tooth was shaped)\n- the pain when I eat/drink something hot/cold travels immediately to the aching jaw/joint and makes it worse.

    "dialogue": "dhaiman1: Hello all, I am on the verge of completing Invisalign (3 more weeks) and want to restore my left front tooth so it matches my right front tooth. The history of the tooth: it had been previously chipped a couple of times, most recently about 7 years ago. At the time I had a slight underbite so the restored the tooth as much as they could with bonding so it would not make contact with my bottom tooth when I bit down. So it was short even with the bonding ( You can see from the X-ray how much of the tooth is actual enamel, I think?). I have seen 3 dentists (1 of whom is a prosthodontist) and asked a friend about it (who is a dentist). My regular dentist and my friend said they would do a veneer because it's more conservative, which I understand means keeping more of my natural tooth. The prosthodontist said it was definitely better to do a crown as a veneer has a much higher chance of popping off because there is not enough natural tooth to bond it to, and also said that he has been doing these for 20 years and has done a veneers on teeth like mine and said they dont last as long. The other general care dentist I saw (who seemed like a pretty new dentist) agreed with the prosthodontist). What do you guys think?\n\nAlso, I am considering getting a veneer for my bottom tooth for aesthetic purposes ofcourse. There is nothing wrong with the tooth it has just become discolored because the root has calcified (probably due to trauma) but the tooth has no pain. Is there any downside or further risk to the tooth if I were to get a veneer for that bottom tooth?\n\nThanks for your help!! honestdoc: First off, your bite will determine success or failure.  I'm suspecting your bite to be very damaging and traumatic.  Hopefully after Invisalign, you will have an ideal anterior overbite and not edge to edge.  If so, any restoration with fail and fracture.  The prosth will have the most experience (crown specialist) and may be the best at restoring with traumatic and difficult bite (occlusion).  Before any crowns, have a visit with the endodontist (root canal specialist) to eval the discolored tooth.  You would want to have a root canal before the crown is placed. dhaiman1: I’ve already had a visit with an endodontist about my bottom front tooth before starting Invisalign  (they said no there is no need for a root canal), but my initial question was about my top front tooth that has already been chipped. So I’ll ask, what are the pros of a veneer in my case? Should I just listen to the prostidontist and not the other dentists? And yes I have an overbite now, I am no longer edge to edge. honestdoc: Veneer as you know is less drilling, more conservative, but more fragile.  Crowns and Veneers can look equally good and cost really similar.  I had mentioned, you may have a more traumatic bite which can fracture veneers.  IMO, I agree with the prosth.  That chipped tooth will be more likely to chip again and needs a more solid restoration. \n\nAnother detail I didn't mention is that the chipped tooth will have a crown (I recommend) that may not match well with the adjacent front incisor.  You may consider maybe a veneer on the adjacent tooth to match the crown because ceramic reflects light differently than natural teeth.\n\nI'm suspecting the chipped tooth may need a root canal.  If so, try not to have it after the crown because the dentist will have to drill through it. dhaiman1: thanks very much for your reply. If I could ask a couple of follow up questions…when comparing a veneer or crown for my chipped tooth, how much more enamel has to be removed? Given you can already see by the X-ray a good amount of my natural tooth is gone. Other question, why do you suspect my top chipped tooth needs a root canal? I’ve never had any pain from the tooth and it’s not discolored… honestdoc: Very good questions.  For veneers,  less removal of tooth structure are required that is why it is more conservative.  With less tooth structure removed, the material is thinner...you can't put thicker material with no room for it.  Thinner material will break/fracture especially if you have an aggressive bite that breaks previous teeth/fillings.  Crowns require more drilling which can accommodate thicker material.  It will be stronger.  There is a balance where we dentist have to drill just right for strength of the material (thickness), retention, and avoiding too much trauma to the nerves in the root canal (pulp). \n\nThe tooth in question needs a vitality test to see if the nerve is healthy or damaged/necrotic.  If it is necrotic (dead), it will be a source for infection.  If you place the expensive crown and need to go back and do a root canal, you damage that crown.\n\nI like zirconia (fake diamond) material with obvious strength to resist fracture.  In dentistry, usually the stronger the material, the less esthetic.  The more esthetic (E-max) is not as strong.  The newer materials are zirconia with esthetic enhancements.  However, it will be a weaker zirconia.  Talk to your dentist/friend/prosth all these options.  Again any material will reflect light differently than enamel so maybe the adjacent tooth can be matched with veneer. dhaiman1: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tVery good questions.

So I visited my prost and he did test a vitality test on the shorter top front tooth and it is healthy. He did mention that more drilling is required and there is a 15% chance that the drilling could cause trauma to the nerve which would require a root canal. This scares me a little, I guess this is why a veneer is more conservative? Less chance of trauma potentially to the nerve if I get a veneer as opposed to a crown? Also, I'm not sure if you can answer this based on my X-ray...given my actual tooth is 1/2-1/3 the size of its original...what is the difference in the amount of drilling for a crown vs a veneer for this particular case? It seems like there is a lot of variability in the dentist, what materials they use, how they go about doing the procedure, etc. The prost I chose seems to have a lot of experience (20+ years) with restorations so I want to trust he will do a good job. As far as shade matching...how concerned should I be about this? I guess you have already answered this and I should follow up with the him about what material he plans on using for a crown honestdoc: Unfortunately crowns need more drilling.  Veneers are just facings bonded.  If the dentist drills minimal for veneers, the final product may appear bulky (less drilling, less room).  Nobody is forcing you to have a crown on the chipped tooth.  I predict if you have a veneer there, it will chip off within a few weeks if not sooner...less drilling equals less strength of the material.  Unfortunately I see a lot of veneers, and E-max crowns fail.  If the dentist say his/her veneers and E-max crowns never fail, that dentist wasn't around when it happened.  \n\nMost dentist do not want to drill unnecessarily.  It is a difficult balance between getting a good result while inflicting minimal trauma.  Many times the best treatment is no drilling, no treatment."

But I've just numbed the holes up in my gums with a light layer of bonjela got my horse teeth out and went for it and they are in, I'm sore but there in. Which brings me to my next question if i took some picture of these dentures in is there any dentists on here who would give me there opinion on the size of these things please I got these done on the NHS and i am thankful for that i did say to the dentist as soon as they were put in before my 2 second glance look in the mirror that these teeth feel like there that long there halfway down my chin he didnt lookat me but assured me thats due to swelling, how the length of the actual teeth themselves grows due to swelling is beyond me lol but he obviously thought i meant bulky i didn't though, the share length of these things just don't sit right literally. After all that complaining can i just say my dentist was an absolute star at what he did hes a newly qualified guy totally rushed of his feet with the whole NHS thing going on literally totally numbing me up sending me out to the waiting room to give it 10 to 15mins to start fully working as i went out he had a patient who was waiting she zoomed in he was fantastic. honestdoc: I do not like immediate dentures since they don't fit as accurately as if they are made after the mouth heals.  Some times immediate dentures are made with the plan of making new ones when the mouth heals.  Try to go back to the dentist for re-eval and denture adjustments.  You may need to reline them soon after your mouth heals. Sis78: Thank you for your reply I'm getting my permanent dentures in 3 to 6 months if all goes well. I just hope and pray they don't look like these things it looks like I've bought fake teeth of amazon I've resorted in doing my second filing job myself on the actual teeth that's the bulk and the length I've took of the 2 front teeth is unreal and they still look huge not touching them no more but couldn't walk around with 2 front teeth touching my chin.And could i ask you a question when i went for my impressions i had 1 front tooth all my top teeth were just roots so no teeth as such for an impression went and got the bite done 2 weeks later and not 1s was any mesurements made as to how big the teeth maybe no measurements at all he poped them in a bag and posted them off for dentist down the road to make im just wondering dont they need measurements to place the teeth i seem to have been given the longest and the widest teeth they had available. honestdoc: When teeth gets extracted, there will be major changes with the bone and gums.  Unfortunately immed dentures will not fit when those changes occur.  Rest assured you will get new dentures soon. Sis78: thanks for your reply"

    "title": "Gum not healing after tooth extraction",
    "dialogue": "epzcaw: I had an upper molar tooth  removed three months ago, and the gum has not healed. I have  seen the dentist several times.  I had dressings applied and am on the fourth course of anti-biotics (Amoxycillin, Metronidazole, Amoxycillin, and now both together).  None of these have made the slightest difference, though only been on the last for just over a day, so maybe too early to say. It can be very painful at times while at other times it is barely noticeable but has got much worse over the last week.  The dentist is going to make an \"urgent referral\" to hospital if it has not cleared hy next week, and has implied that there is the possibility of something nasty, which she didnt go into and I didn't ask at the time -I think it has taken some time for this to sink in.  I assume that the concern is some sort of cancer, and given the time scale at which the NHS is operating at the moment, I would like so have some idea of what the \"something nasty\" could be.  I have had many extractions (sadly) in the past without any such problems.  Any information or advice welcome.  Thank you. MattKW: When you drink water or other fluids, does it come out your nose? The most likely issue with upper molar extractions is a tear into the maxillary sinus (an oro-antral communication, OAC) which if it doesn't close over naturally, would require a surgeon to close it up. \nThere is absolutely no point taking repeated antibiotics unless you have an infected swelling (cellulitis) and/or a fever. \nCancer is well down the list of possibilities. epzcaw: No, I don't have water coming out my nose.  Dentist did say that my sinus is very close to extracted tooth. My maxillary sinus on the affected side has been problematic for many years (though not very badly) but hasn't got noticeably worse during this.  \n\nI was not been keen to accept antibiotics afte the first lot failed to do any good, but when you are in pain, it is difficult to refuse a possible solution.  I have had more antibiotics in the last three months than I have had in the last twenty years!!  This is because I have not needed them, not because I have any issues with them.  I greatly respect anti-biotics, know how much they are needed and how overuse is killing them!\n\nThank you for the reaassurance re cancer. While no expert on this, I don't see what sort of cancer would be causing this.   \n\nTime, and one hopes the experts, will tell!!!\n\nThanks again. epzcaw: I thought I should report back on this. \n\nMy dentist referred me for an urgent cancer appointment. I saw the consultant today, and he had a look, and said he didn’t think it was a cancer, but had an X-ray done, which confirmed this. He said that I should not have been referred  (another genuine patient will have missed a slot). He thinks the problem is debris left behind at the extraction and commented that if he had done the extraction, he would known the score. They will open it up and clean it out next week. My dentist is in bad odour......\n\nThank you again for your reassurance, MattKW, though I have to confess to lots of sleepless nights and worry till today - I should have heeded you!! MattKW: Thank you for the update. Glad to hear the good news. MattKW epzcaw: Final report on this. They debrided the problem gum about six weeks ago - opened it up, cleared it out, removed non-healing tissue, and stitched it together. I have had absolutely no problems after that and had a final appointment today which confirmed that it is now fully healed and back to normal.  The problem seems to have been caused by packing used by the dentist.  This was not at the time of the extraction, but was later on when they decided I was suffereing from dry sokcet and added some sort of dressing (iodine? cloves?  both?).  There were remants of this which were causing infection."

    "dialogue": "nufc1975: Hi,\n\nI've had an issue with my tongue for a while now where it gets quite sore. I was diagnosed with TMJ a while ago & when stressed (which has been a lot for a while now) I wake up with aching jaws. I am aware that I press tongue against teeth.\n\nTongue was occasionally very sore over summer. It lost about half of the buds covering, in patterns that would gradually change. Changing toothpaste to a non-lauryl sulphate brand seems to have helped. Before I switched, tip of tongue would usually be bright red & swollen. But it still occasionally burns, especially on the tips. It is burning again today down sides & at tip.\n\nWas fine for about a week or so & I thought it was markedly improving, then it has seemed to flare again.\n\nBloods etc all normal. I did have COVID prior to onset of this in January.\n\nI do occasionally have marks where teeth are, most notably where I have two upper molars missing.\n\nI suffer from health anxiety & freaked myself out a while back when I looked up tongue issues & went on a Google trail that went marks on teeth -> macroglossia & then saw amyloidosis etc.... \n\nAny opinion? Perfectly happy to be told this is normal & anxiety causes symptoms. I am borderline Generalised Anxiety Disorder diagnosis btw.\n\nFirst two pics are after a tongue clean, third one is in morning before a clean. I get this yellow coating that comes off easily enough. nufc1975: Apologies, duplicate threads. Looked like this hadn't posted so I did the other one! honestdoc: It appears you have a geographic tongue and what you're experiencing is unfortunately normal.  I have the same experiences you are having.  Best advice is to use the most basic toothpaste.  If any new toothpaste seem irritating, don't use any that have too many additives like Peroxide, whitening, tartar control, cinnamon, etc.  Try to minimize anything that irritates like citrus, acidic substances. nufc1975: Thanks, much appreciated. Was the swollen feeling that I found disturbing but guess that's part of the fun. \n\nI'm using the most basic of toothpaste but last couple of days had a nasty reaction to 1) beef flavour crisps & 2) red wine. \n\nReally quite sore after those, always at tip & down sides. Then it catches on teeth & seems like a vicious circle. \n\nPretty sure stress plays a role.... nufc1975: No obvious concern over swelling of tongue? \n\nWhat is opinion on creamy coating? Is it worth trying thrush treatment? \n\nThanks again. nufc1975:  honestdoc: It's very rare to get thrush (fungal infection) in the mouth unless you have 1 or more of these 4 D's...Drugs (antibiotics, medications), Diabetes, Debilitating, Dentures.  Usually the tongue heals very quickly and I'll be surprised if it lasted more than 1 week. nikroute: If usual treatment and precautions does not help , go for accupunture therapy ( clinical evidence are there in many dental literature recorded ) . It's helps alot . Only when this condition is chronic nufc1975: Thanks, I think it definitely is chronic unfortunately. What I was mega worried about was it being macroglossia as that can indicate horrendous conditions. \n\nThis pic is from today. General burning & dry mouth feeling back again, but I am feeling the anxiety big time again. \n\nI do clench teeth & suspect you can see it in pics of teeth & jaw that have lumps on them. \n\nIts just the risk of macroglossia that's worrying me in all honesty but I've been reassured that this isn't that. nikroute: Don't think or diagnose yourself\n\nYou have multiple factors as you stated GAD , DRY MOUTH etc so a perfect medical practitioner only can came to a conclusion.\n\n\nAs far as I am educated by my dentist, if it was he than he would do clinical examination with some blood work and serological investigation along with if required some radiology etc .\n\n\nGet a proper discussion with your dentist or ENT. Diagnosis might take time but it will be ok . Do not Google search about it . Cause most of the time Google says wrong things and fuel up anxiety and stress"

    "title": "Gum pain between two teeth when chewing, X-ray attached",
    "dialogue": "Mukros: Hello. For the last 6 weeks I've been having moderate pain between two molars when and after eating, especially something hard. Food gets visibly stuck between these two particular teeth, it doesn't happen anywhere else, and when I try to floss I have a feeling that I just push it deeper. In fact, I even managed to dig out food from under the gum a few times.\n\nThe problem started when I went to have my teeth cleaned, I hadn't experienced any pain before. My dentist insists that cleaning couldn't do it and it just \"happened naturally somehow\". He says that now I either have to try to floss food out every time, go for a filling replacement, or cover these teeth with crowns.\n\nCan I have your opinions? Is it possible to fix it with proper hygiene, or there is no choice but to replace a filling? Thank you. Dr M: Good day\n\nIt looks like you have a food trap in between the two teeth, that can lead to gum inflammation and swelling if something gets stuck. Unfortunately, the only way the food trap can be closed is either with replacing the fillings with new fillings with tighter contacts, or to crown both teeth. I would consider crowns if possible, due to the teeth being root canal treated.\nNormal oral hygiene habits are not a guarantee that food won't get lodged in this space, an if it isn't cleaned out regularly, it can lead to future cavity formation, or even bone loss in between the teeth due to constant inflammation. Mukros: Thanks for the fast reply. Is it true that redone fillings will be more likely to crack with time? Dr M: No this is not true. Both your teeth have had root canal treatments on. This means they are actually \"dead\" teeth and can become brittle over time, which can increase the risk of fracture. Even more so since this is molars that you use to chew with."

    "dialogue": "Astrevea: Hi everyone,\nPlease see the attached file. I had a crack in my seventh bottom tooth, the piece of tooth to the left of the crack (as per image) came out a couple of weeks ago when I was picking it. This tooth is also a dead tooth, as root canal was done on it in 2015. After the piece of tooth came out, I started noticing bad smell coming from the tooth, I went to the dentist and he said it's the food getting stuck there, although he didn't say specifically where it was stuck. He cleaned it, maybe used some kind of vacuum to extract the remains of food (I am not too sure) and placed a temporary filling in place of the piece of tooth. Then for about a week I was chewing with the left side only and there was no smell, but after that I started to chew in a more regular manner and a couple of days ago I noticed that horrible smell again, it's from this tooth, 100%. I went to the dentist asking him to redo the temporary filling, but he said there is no need for that and said the food gets trapped between teeth. Today I bought a flosser and mouth wash and used both properly, but the bad smell is still there. Could it be that some particles of food are now trapped under the filling and no matter how much I rinse it just won't come out? I would appreciate any help with this. It's really bothering me. honestdoc: Are you planning to get a crown there?  The tooth is prone for catastrophic fracture. Astrevea: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAre you planning to get a crown there?  The tooth is prone for catastrophic fracture. I am, yes. I have been told by two different dentists that the wisdom tooth will need to be removed first. In terms of my question, my cousin who is a dentist said it could be a periodontal pocket, but not 100%. Could that be the case? As a second option, just before the piece of tooth came out when I was picking it, a tiny piece of bone from minced meet got into one of the gaps between teeth, most likely between the 7th and 8th, that is why a started picking that tooth in the first place. When that piece of tooth came out, I was in a slight shock, I don't actually remember if I managed to get the bone out, I may have forgotten, and maybe it went all the way down in that gap between the 7th and 8th. I suppose if I got an x ray done it would be seen on the image? honestdoc: Looking at your previous x-ray, I don't think you have a periodontal pocket deeper than 5 mm.  Try to get the wisdom teeth removed as soon as possible, allow the area to heal and get a crown very soon."

Sensitivity to cold, heat, slight pain when eating, I can feel lukewarm water if I swish it around. I had a second opinion and they blew air around one side, and caused pain. I had them take x-rays, and I can't see an opening. I had zero issues with this tooth before the crown, none.\n\nSecond opinion appears to be a possible open margin. Will an open margin always be visible on bite wing x-rays? If not, what other x-rays will show one? I'm going back to the dentist who did the crown this week and really need them to explore this. In Pain:  Dr M: Good day\nUnfortunately it is not always possible to see an open margin on a bite-wing, since it gives a 2D image. Sometimes the open margin can be probed. \nAnother possibility might be pulpitis due to a crown prep on a vital tooth. This is always a risk when prepping a crown on a vital tooth. The prep might have been too close to the nerve.  If the pain worsens, it might be an indication for a root canal treatment.

I don't want to get a root canal if nit needed.\n\nBTW, I can floss at an angle and feel it catching on the edge of the crown close to the gum. Also blowing air around that spot irritates it, wouldn't those be signs of a crown not seated? Dr M: Those all could be signs of an open margin, but it could also be hooking onto a piece of excess cement. This area should be thoroughly investigated. I would wait for the symptoms to become more severe before considering a root canal. For example, episodes of lingering pain or spontaneous pain throughout the night.\nAlso be aware that any root canal treatment performed through a crown, has a risk of crown fracture meaning the crown might need to be re-done.

She looked around, adjusted my Bite, and took a few x-rays. Not once did she Mention root canal at all.\n\nShe Said everything looked good from what she could see. She wants me to try and give it a month before exploring further. She feels this tooth is just experiencing sensitivity from the procedure and the crown and should go away. While I have a hard time understanding that, I looked at the x-rays too. I don't see an open margin. She painted some stuff on the base of the tooth and ground down high spots. Gave me sensodyne to rub around the tooth. \n\nShe said she doesn't want to do something I may not need, which I agree. The last thing I want is to get a root canal and not need it. Idk, I don't see this just going away. Will give it as long as I can, will probably go elsewhere if it doesn't improve.\n\nIn your expert opinion, is this diagnosis even possible or is there a problem with the crown? Is it possible a molar could experience sensitivity and pain after a crown? Thank you so much for your help, I don't know who else to reach out to. Dr M: Sensitivity is possible after the crown prep yes. Depending on how conservative the dentist was during the initial visit, a lot of times, dentine gets exposed. This exposed dentine can lead to post operative sensitivity and it can take some time to settle. I would also give it a month, especially after occlusal adjustments.\nA root canal should be a last resort yes.

Symptoms the exact same, but now after eating on that side I have a burning pain for 1 minute that goes away. It seems like biting on that tooth causing pain inflames the nerve for a little bit?\n\nWent back to dentist who referred me to endodontist who strictly does root canals for examination. He took x-rays, looked around, and believes the nerve is inflamed simply from the procedure of the crown. He said since the Symptoms started even with temporary crown, he doesn't believe a replacement crown will fix the problem. He said the heat cold problem will get fixed with root canal, and believes the pain will as well. He talked about it like he's just trying to sell it.\n\nHere I am, wondering whether another crown willfix it. The exam was $100, and root canal $1,400. Since the doctor didn't believe my dentist messed up, I can't go to them to ask to cover part of this. I don't want to get a root canal and still be in pain, or not need it. I have no Symptoms outside of eating or drinking cold liquid.\n\nShould I not pursue a root canal until Symptoms start worse, request my crown under warranty be replaced, or just give it more time? Should I ask my dentist office to cover part of the bill? I'm sorry, but I don't believe a tooth with zero problem before will somehow need a root canal right after a crown unless the dentist messed up. See this newest x-ray. Please help. In Pain: Doesn't it look like the crown is into the root canal itself on this x-ray?"

    "title": "General Concerns on TMJ",
    "dialogue": "soulbee: I am typing to ask some general questions. They are too general and I am a little embarrassed to see a dentist for this, and too anxious to google.\n\nI've had TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder) for around 8 years. I even got braces in hopes it'll fix my overbite, but the dentist said my mouth was too small and it was unnecessary to over-fix my bite. It all came to a climax when my jaw clicked too hard one day in class, and I couldn't open my mouth at all (less than 2 cm). That was around 4 years ago, and my jaw has improved considerably well. I broke a molar since then and had a crown fitted to the other side (it was broken). So I guess I switched which the 'emptier' sides of my mouth are. I am also a mouth breather.\n\nWith that in mind, here are my questions.\n1. I am very worried about breaking my molars. It was very traumatic to hear that I needed two implants, and I was very lucky that I was able to get a root treatment and crown for one. I was not informed of any particular reason for breaking huge chunks of my molars (more than half, past gum line), and neither of them were filled; both were 'real' tooth. What can I do to stop my molars from breaking? I am curious if there is any underlying reason behind this kind of situation, and if it is preventable. Or is it just TMJ...?\n2. Any tips or additional help for me to rehabilitate my jaw? Improve my breathing? Breathe through nose-not-mouth and stop clenching jaw? I've read about the mewing technique, and it seems to me a good solution (the mewing technique I especially support), but I don't think it is supported by dentists. I have no idea why, or if this is some sort of scam in education. honestdoc: Having TMJ  Disorder can be very complicated beyond the scope of this platform.  With TMD, ortho treatment can stress and complicate it more.  You need to have a dentist you trust and a referral to a TMJ specialist working as a team.  Without proper TMJ management, you can further damage your teeth and jaws."

What actually happens to it when it heals? Will the entrance of the hole seal up, leaving an empty space inside, along with any food particles trapped inside? Or will the \"floor\" of the hole eventually push outwards?\n2) I see many online suggestions to just leave the food particles in the hole where it is. Is that safe? Won't the food decay and cause an infection?\n3) is it possible to tell if a food particle is trapped inside a hole? Currently, I have this odd sensation that i have a piece of food trapped inside but I can't tell if it's my imagination/paranoia, because whenever I shine a torchlight and look at the mirror, all I see is this hole with an endless bottom soaked in the colour black. honestdoc: Those questions are very legitimate.  If you think you may have some trapped debris, rinse gently with warm salt water.  Try not to disturb the area.  Usually the mouth heals uneventfully.  If you have pain and or swelling, you need to get followup from the surgeon."

    "dialogue": "Ana25: Hello! This year I’m having already the third tooth+gum infection and all of them on different teeth. All of these teeth were treated in different periods of my life (root canal+crown). Every time it starts from the light pain when chewing and then quickly escalates to unbearable pain all the time that hardly goes away under painkillers. Then gum around that tooth gets swollen and then the cheek. On the x-ray it shows pus near the root. \n\nThis year I was pregnant and now I’m breastfeeding. My hygiene is pretty OK in my opinion- I brush twice a day with electrical toothbrush, floss and use mouthwash that I got from my dentist.\n\nWhat could be the reason of such frequent infections? And what should I do or check to prevent in the future again? It’s so exhausting and I’m terrified of getting it again Dr M: Good day\nDo you perhaps have any x-rays? It sounds like your root canals are failing. I would go see your dentist so that these teeth can be examined and options such as retreatments or extractions can be discussed. Ana25: Hello, thanks for reply. I don’t have my x-rays on me unfortunately, but yes I went to the dentist each time and all teeth were treated. What bothers me is why it happened so many times this year… maybe there is some reason for that or is it just a pure coincidence nikassam: I can understand your situation. I came accross the same\n\nMy dentist after 2 infection of teeth treatment.

    "dialogue": "Frequentvisitor: I had extensive work done at a dentist that for many reasons I lost all confidence in. All of these reasons have to do with what I believe can only be described as substandard skills. I am not trying to attack this dentist, I actually hate that I am not able to provide high praise because I appreciate the help she provided that is not related to technical skills, she helped me figure out the source of my extreme fear of the dentist and so honestly changed my life for the better and I am always going to be grateful for that. \n\n  The big problem though, is that I have severe problems related to treatments she provided and these cannot be corrected. For example, I have a bridge that is not fitted properly, I am biting my tongue and cheek when I speak, my bite is off and I have increasing discomfort in the 2 anchor teeth that several dentists agree will eventually require root canals to relieve. The material of the bridge is so thin that adjustments are not possible without the complete destruction of the porcelain, and the metal was visible from the moment it was delivered. I commented on this and the Dr. told me that it was because a natural tooth reflects light and because these were not \"live\" teeth they would appear dark at the gums like that. It didn't seem right but I have no knowledge to challenge this explanation and so I gave the benefit of the doubt to hee. Other issue were not as permanent and can be corrected, like fillings regularly needing replaced, cement being left around the side of a crown, choosing to form a night guard from an impression which involved a missing tooth that was to be replaced a short time from then and so would make that appliance useless, what actually happened is that it broke a couple of weeks after I received it anyway. \n\n   I would like to just move on because I found a new dentist who is amazing and we are getting through these hurdles. The problem is that I am experiencing some feelings that I have never dealt with before. It is pain but not like a toothache, it is like sharp, burning, take my breath away intense white hot metallic episodes of extreme discomfort that overloads my senses and seem to be from a particular area but when the dentist examines the tooth it is fine. I am wondering, and it honestly is a terrifying thought, but I suspect that it may be coming from a tooth that the first dentist performed a root canal on. What if it was not done properly and there is something brewing under this crown instead of the tooth that presented as having a lost filling and Crack. Is this possible and would that be something to bring up with my current dentist? I think she thinks I am crazy because she says that she is baffled as to why I would be having these sensations. Is it possible that it's all in my mind? Or is this something that anyone may have come across in their own careers? Thank you for reading this, and I am more than grateful for any advice you may have. honestdoc: I'm sorry for your poor experience.  Anytime one gets an extensive treatment plan, I always recommend getting different opinions.  I'm in the minority that I favor conservative and least traumatic options.  If you trust your dentist, by all means bring up all of your concerns. Frequentvisitor: Thank you. You are how I thought every dentist is, I assumed that all dentists were honorable and benevolent because I grew up with a dentist in the family,spent summers working in the office and it never occurred to me that there could be dentists that weren't operating their office with an intense sense of responsibility and care. Thank you for being ethical."

Some of my front teeth have chipped and broke off extensively to the point where they must be extracted.This will leave me with only 5 teeth on the top. Two of the remaining teeth have some minor chipping as well, and the other 3 molars are okay. \n\nI can not decide which is the best way for me to proceed. Shoudl I add teeth to my partial or get a top denture? I have read if you have any teeth left, that it is best to keep them. However, I have had to add teeth to my cast metal partial before and it would be considerably cheaper than a top denture. I'm a little leary of the two chipped teeth that will be remaining. Any insight to my situation would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks honestdoc: How are they functioning?  Are they staying in or do they come loose?  Do you have pain and or swelling on your remaining teeth?  There are a lot of variables to consider including costs. dar77: Overall my partial is doing well, it may be just a tinge loose because there is a tooth missing in one spot it use to clamp on. This was the only tooth that was loose and it came out on its' own. I've been fortunate so far and have not experienced any real pain with the badly chipped teeth. Once in a while there is a tinge of sensitivity in one of them.  My gums seem fine as well with no swelling or pain.\n\nMy greatest concern is based on the fear the two remaining teeth in the front with minor chipping, will start breaking away like the two that need to be extracted now. For some unknown reason the past three months my teeth started chipping significantly.  One tooth  has broken off to the point there is a little less than half left.\n\nThanks!"

    "dialogue": "desperate_thing6628: Hey all,\n\nSo, I have severe dental anxiety. I hadn't been to the dentist in 5+ years but decided that this was the year I needed to address things. I was also feeling some pain from impacted wisdom teeth and knew that those likely needed to be dealt with.\n\nSo, over the course of 2 months (starting in April), I had my wisdom teeth removed and on the recommendation of my dentist, had a filling (on 17) and a crown (on 18). The crown had quite a few complications and required many visits. I want to say about 6-8.\n\nA couple days before they put in the permanent crown, I started feeling a slight pain when biting down on that area. At first I wasn't sure if it was the crowned tooth that was causing me pain or the tooth above it. I brought it up to my dentist and they thought it was likely just the pressure on the crown. So, once I had the permanent in, they adjusted my bite. I had to go back for a second bite adjustment and some cement removal a couple days later and was still experiencing the pain. So, I brought it up again. My dentist this time adjusted the bite in my upper tooth (as I also have a filling there). After this adjustment, the pain was much worse. Though it is only painful when I bite down in that area. And only when I bite on food or objects-- not when I clench my teeth together. No pain when I push on the area. And it seems to be very localized. I can bite down in some areas back there as long as it doesn't hit that one spot.\n\nI waited a few weeks, hoping that maybe it was just pain from all the dental work that I had had over the past couple months. But after 3 weeks, the pain hadn't gone away. So, I went back to my dentist, who suggested that it might be the ligament around the tooth that was swollen from the dental work. They recommended that I take a few days of large doses of Ibuprofen and see if the pain subsided.\n\nIt didn't, so they referred me to an Endodontist. I just visited them yesterday morning. They did a couple tests and determined that the pain was present in both 14&15. From what I understand, they said they thought it was fluid shifting around in my teeth and causing pain. I don't understand this thoroughly-- I was also upset (because anxiety) and I wasn't in a great frame of mind to ask questions. They said the only 2 treatment options would be either getting both teeth crowned or jumping straight to a root canal. This seems crazy to me because there's nothing visibly wrong with these teeth--that why my dentist referred me to the endo in the first place. But I'm not an expert, which is why I decided to post here.\n\nIs there really no other treatment option for this mysterious pain? Could it be something else that the dentist or endo didn't mention? Should I get a second opinion?\n\nIt just seems as though the endo wasn't super sure what the cause was and just wanted to try a treatment option. He said try getting them crowned, but if that doesn't work, come back and get a root canal. But it seems crazy to me to remove good portions of my molars just to hope it will stop the pain.\n\nAny advice you can give would be appreciated. I also have x-rays if that would be helpful to share.\n\nTLDR: After a lot of dental work, I'm now being told that I need 2 additional crowns (on 14&15) to treat a mystery pain. Do I really? MattKW: Probably go to another dentist for an opinion, and take copies of your records and X-rays. Sure, put up your X-rays on this forum and we might be able to help. It would be very useful if you showed us X-rays taken pre-treatment as well as after the initial treatment. desperate_thing6628: I only have copies of x-rays from after the first crown, unfortunately. But I have attached both below!\n\nThank you so much for your response! MattKW: The upper teeth look fine and require no obvious treatment. DON'T start crowning them. \n\n\nBased on the limited info, it sounds most likely that there is still a high spot on the lower crown at a certain biting position. I'm curious why the crown took so many appts; normally only 2 appts or 3 at most.\n\nI would firstly recheck your \"bite\" and adjust the crown ONLY (not the opposing tooth).\nIt looks more like a large onlay covering the cusps than a full-encirclement crown. It appears as if you still have an older filling either on the outer side of the tooth or under the onlay. And at the lower edge of that tooth is an area of radiolucency - this may be decay that hasn't been removed (arrowed). Discuss with your dentist.\nNext case scenario is to remove the crown and place a simple temporary plastic crown to see if it settles down again.\nYou don't mention what type of material the crown/onlay is made of. I suspect it may be zirconia - a very strong material that is a pain to adjust or remove. Once adjusted, it weakens them. My preference for a 2nd molar would be a high yellow gold-content (precious alloy). Much easier to adjust, and much gentler to the wear of the opposing teeth.\nIf the temp crown doesn't resolve the pain, only THEN would I consider a root anal therapy. desperate_thing6628: That's extremely helpful thank you! It was the direction to crown the upper two teeth that was so concerning to me.\nMy only question is. if it's the lower crown that's causing the issue, then why do I seem to be feeling the acute pain in my upper teeth? Is it just hitting a bad spot? Or what?\n\nTo answer your question about the process of crowning the lower tooth, it took many appointments to get a permanent crown that fit the tooth below. The first permanent crown appointment I had, my dentist was concerned with a shadow underneath that turned out to be trapped debris-- but she had to drill the filling to get it. So, they had to re-scan for a permanent. The second appointment, the crown they sent just didn't fit. Same with the third. The fourth finally fit, but I had to have multiple adjustments to it.\n\nI believe that my dentist is aware of the state of the crowned tooth-- they're waiting to see if it will heal before referring me for a root canal. \n\nAlso, I am happy to provide any other detail that might be helpful-- just not sure what that would be.\n\nThank you so much for responding! I really appreciate your advice! Definitely makes me feel like I'm not crazy for questioning the advice of crowning what appear to be healthy teeth. MattKW: The pain may feel like it's coming from the top teeth, but may be referred from the lower. I may be wrong, of course, but everything seemed OK for you until you got this crown. It is not impossible that the uneven bite of the crown has caused a crack in one of the upper teeth, but I'd prefer not to start tampering with other teeth; just concentrate on the one that's been treated recently (the crowned tooth) or you risk \"muddying the waters\" and start causing pain for other reasons.\nI would persist in having the crown adjusted more heavily, or removed and temporised, and possibly replaced with gold. I wouldn't be starting an RCT unless the pain was continuous, woke you whilst sleeping, and was not relieved by painkillers. desperate_thing6628: Okay, thank you so much! And just to clarify, you're talking about the RCT related to the lower tooth, right? MattKW: Yes. You don't have the correct signs and symptoms to start an RCT in any of your teeth until simpler (for you!) procedures have been attempted. The dentist may not want to do what I outlined earlier because he's looking to fix your problem with least time and money on his part, but I think that if you start an RCT (lower tooth) at this stage, it risks not addressing the real problem (prob poor occlusion) and starts to make other problems appear. desperate_thing6628: Thank you so much! I've discussed your recommendations with my dentist and we are starting with another adjustment to the crown this week. I'm also going to start using a night guard.

In my opinion, not a dentist, but I have studied some dentistry for a while and I believe the pain is in 14 and 15 because 18 and 17 is hitting them. (And is 17 a wisdom?)  I believe something is wrong with your bite because of those new crowns. They most likely don’t fit we’ll. What does your gut say? desperate_thing6628: Thanks for your response!\n\nTo give an update, I have not had more crowns put in. After reviewing the advice from this thread with my dentist, we re-adjusted the existing crown and I started using a night guard. This has significantly reduced my pain. \n\nI am starting to believe that the pain may indeed be from a cracked tooth, but with it being minimal currently (depending on my bite), I'm okay living with it unless/until the pain gets worse.\n\nI do notice that when I forget to use my night guard, the pain is worse the following day. So, I'm hopeful that with continued use of that, I can avoid any further treatment."

I’ve just noticed there’s a bit of bone sticking out in that spot. It’s not like just a little tiny spur either. I don’t know if it’s normal for this to happen years after having my teeth extracted? Now I’m worried this won’t heal on its own and I don’t know if I’ll have to have my dentist take care of it. Unfortunately I don’t have the option of just leaving my denture out all day, because of work. Dr M: Good day\nIt is possible that it could be a retained dental root, that only now is starting to protrude through the gum. Continuous denture wear leads to generalized bone loss over time, so it is common for any retained root pieces to become exposed, even if it is years down the line. If this is causing irritation or influences denture wear, it is best that you go see your dentist, to have the small piece removed. Quite often it is a relatively easy procedure."

The tooth feels sensitive, especially in that area, and also feels a little rough while brushing.\nHere's a photo of the tooth now:\n\n\n\nIs this really okay? Should I just leave it like that? I'm genuinely afraid of it breaking off even more and reaching a state where it can't be saved anymore! Dr M: Good day\nIt looks like a piece of filling came out.

    "dialogue": "corpton79: I have a cavity in a premolar that's somewhat deep. The pulp and root are totally unaffected, and there is a margin of unaffected dentin around the cavity. My dentist suggested a root canal. I will probably go to an endodontist to confirm that this is the best treatment option, but I just wanted to know if there are any less aggressive alternatives that I should ask about. Most of the information online about root canals and other endodontic procedures are focused on cases where the pulp is infected, so I'm not sure what I should be asking about, or if it's even worth asking about alternatives. I realize each case is unique and you can't give many details without seeing x-rays, but I'm just looking for general information here so I feel more prepared when I go to the endodontist. Any info is much appreciated, thank you. Dr M: Good day\n\nWhy did your dentist suggest a root canal if the pulp is unaffected? What are your symptoms? corpton79: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tGood day\n\nWhy did your dentist suggest a root canal if the pulp is unaffected? What are your symptoms? Good day, thank you for your reply. \n\nI have no symptoms at all, no pain or sensitivity. My dentist made it sound like the margin between the pulp and the cavity was too small and so doing a filling would hit the pulp, or something like that. Dr M: Is there still decay that needs to be cleaned out? If not, you can try a sedative filling, as a temporary filling, and then later replace it with a permanent filling if the tooth remains asymptomatic. To devitalize a tooth, without any clear infection or symptoms, is never a good idea in my opinion corpton79: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIs there still decay that needs to be cleaned out?

Nothing was done because they wanted to just do it all at once with the root canal. \n\nThank you so much for your assistance and insights, it's very nice to hear that a less aggressive option is viable. Dr M: Just be careful. If there is still decay that needs to be removed, there is definitely a chance that your dentist could be correct. For a more accurate opinion, a x-ray would be required. MattKW: In my student days (80s), we aggressively removed ALL decay, even if this meant exposing the nerve and starting a root canal therapy (RCT). Nowadays, it has been found that if the tooth has no symptoms, then it is often feasible to remove all infected (soft) decay, and leave the deepest layer of uninfected (affected) decay under the filling. If the filling seals well, then the decay will stop spreading. This is called \"selective\" decay removal. Dr M: I agree with MattKW. There are various caries indicating dyes that can be used to determine the extent of the decay, and if the left over tooth structure is infected or only affected. corpton79: Thank you both for the replies! Here are some of my most recent x-rays Dr M: From the x-rays, and based on the fact that the tooth is asymptomatic, I would try a filling first, and then only resort to root canal treatment if the tooth becomes symptomatic. corpton79: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFrom the x-rays, and based on the fact that the tooth is asymptomatic, I would try a filling first, and then only resort to root canal treatment if the tooth becomes symptomatic. Thank you so much, I will feel much better going into a second opinion now! One more thing, I want to understand what would cause it to become symptomatic, if all the decay was removed and the filling properly done? Thank you again for all your help Dr M: There is always a chance that any deep filling, close to the nerve, can cause a pulpitis of the nerve over a period of time and then eventually a root canal might be needed"

Drink occasionally but other than that uneventful.\n\nI am missing three back molars in total due to teeth issues as a child, and lack of money to replace them. I had a check up in January 2022 and was referred to a dental surgeon due to a tongue lesion that turned out to be caused by amalgam.\n\nThe dentist did a thorough check up but did not raise any issues. I couldn't tell you how long it has been there but I think it has been there for a good few months, if not during the initial checkup in January.\n\nI only noticed it due to me properly wrenching on my cheek. It feels smooth to the though and with my tongue.\n\nThe molars at the back of my mouth are quite rough? Both back molars are cracked and a few months ago they did cause some irritation on the inside of my cheeks, I have a check up scheduled for this Wednesday and I am going to ask them to file them down.\n\nThe redness on the right side (first picture) is caused by my poking, prodding and scratching.\n\nI am quite worried about it as you do fear the worst. I have tried rubbing it off but it does not wish to go. I found similar white marks in both sides but just wish to get an idea of what it could be? MattKW: First photo looks like a simple apthous ulcer (canker sores in USA); can't see what concerns you in pic 2. No treatment is necessary and they will heal naturally in 10-15 days. They will recur occasionally, especially in younger people, but decrease in frequency over 30yo. They are thought to be a T-cell mediated reaction to minor trauma. Now that you have a photo, you also have a time stamp that will allow you to see how it goes, and to show your dentist. HAFear: Hey thanks for the reply. I am prone to mouth ulcers and have been since I was a child.\n\nThis is the first time I have seen it and the dentist never mentioned anything during the last check-up so it may just be the remnants of an ulcer. \n\nI do have a feeling that I have felt it there for quite a while though and think I have felt it for quite some time, so that is making me anxious but it doesn't to seem to have done anything and checking this morning it doesn't look as white. \n\nI'll mention it to the dentist and get her to have a look."

It does sound like you have a fracture, because common signs of a possible crack is pain when biting down, with relief as pressure is released. In order to determine if bonding will fix the issue, the crack has to be located first. It then has to be determined how deep the crack goes. If the crack penetrates the pulpal floor, the tooth will need to be extracted. If it does not, it can sometimes be fixed with a filling with or without a root canal.

I should have mentioned, every time I’ve been, I see a different dentist, whereas I’ve always seen the same one at other practices.\n\nI’ll summarise the aspects of the visit I wasn’t happy with to try and keep this short – I was confused that she seemed to not know how to work the chair, which didn’t fill me with confidence. She injected anaesthetic and it seemed like half of it got squirted directly into my mouth so I had to sit up to rinse, which has also never happened to me. Fixing the filling took a very long time, much longer than I’ve experienced before. These things aren’t a big deal and were frustrating at the time, but the main thing – She then moved on to the scale/polish and it was extremely painful, which I’ve also never experienced. I definitely don’t have a low pain threshold, but it felt like she was butchering my gums. I kept wincing in pain and I was drenched with sweat, but she seemed totally oblivious when I said it hurt. She asked if I was nervous and if I was warm.\n\nIt’s now a week later and I’ve been in constant pain. The filling was on the upper left, but the pain is on the lower left. It hurts a bit all the time, but the pain increases significantly when I eat or drink because it is so sensitive to temperature differences now.\n\nI assume it’s just bad luck on my part, as I know I can’t assume all of the dentists that work there are inexperienced or incompetent, but I don’t know what to do now. I don’t want to go back and see the same person that didn’t seem to have a clue what she was doing, but I’m not sure what else I can do, other than contact a private dentist and pay a fortune to start from the beginning, but I don’t even know for certain whether my dentist was actually at fault.\n\n I’m not sure exactly what I’m asking for to be honest, I was just hoping for a bit of advice on what to do, and I wondered whether anyone has had similar experiences. Thanks in advance. Dr M: Good day\nSorry to hear about your experience.\nThe filling that she did, might have been very deep and close to the nerve, which explains why she took so long. If this pain persists, it might be an indication that you actually needed a root canal and not only a normal filling. Do you have any x-rays you could share?\nI would suggest trying to see the same dentist for a follow-up visit. She can also then adjust the occlusion a little bit.\nAny filling that is a bit \" high \" , might cause pain on the opposing tooth due to the \" bite\" being slightly off.\nBleeding gingiva during a cleaning, might be due and underlying gingivitis. Do you have any systemic diseases? How long do you usually wait between cleanings?\nThere could be a range of reasons to explain this."

    "dialogue": "metanerd278: Good morning. Last year, my kids' dentist found and filled 12 cavities between the two. Two boys, ages 3 and 6. \n\nIs this abnormal and/or a sign of any neglect? I didn't have my first cavity until adulthood, so for my boys to have 6 each seems high. They don't stay with me primarily. Dr M: Good day\nJust because you had no cavities, does not mean your children won't have any cavities. This might be an indication that they are neglecting their brushing, or even that they are taking in too many sugary foods. I would emphasize regular 6 monthly check-ups with the dentist or oral hygienist, as well as check up on them that they are brushing twice a day, as they should be. Also check their sugar intake.\nI would also emphasize this with the other parent where they are staying.\nBaby teeth are important with regards to space maintenance as well as factors such  as mastication and speech development.\nThey also have nerve tissue and neglect could cause pain or abscess formation.\nEarly loss of baby teeth also increases the risks for orthodontic treatment when they are older. Nora A Carman: Hey, I think this is because of the poor diet and oral hygiene that your children are maintaining. They won't pay any attention to these kinds of hygiene and control at this age, but as parents, we can do a lot for them. Ask them to brush their teeth twice a day and make sure they follow that. Children can't avoid sweets and sugar-containing foods, but we can reduce their consumption of these foods by including calcium-rich dairy products and fruits and vegetables that increase saliva, such as carrots and apples. It helps prevent bacterial growth at a rate that saves your child's teeth from cavities."

How fast do the teeth shift after pulling a tooth, and just how much do they really shift? Dr M: Good day\nTo tell you if it is a good idea to do the extraction, is dependent on several factors. How decayed is the tooth? Are there any other options in order to try and save the tooth? Teeth adjacent to the extraction site, tend to shift or tilt after an extraction, but this can take a year or more to happen. This might influence your chances of replacing the missing tooth later due to space limitation etc.\nI tend to see an extraction as a last resort, because when a tooth is gone, you can't get it back."

It showed up on x-rays, and my dentist said it needs to be restored. It's uncomfortable to chew more than modestly hard. Using a water pik was very uncomfortable, and one of those tiny between-the-teeth dental brushes (barely fits) is downright painful. It's not overtly painful, but I am aware that it is there. I have cut out all refined sugars, and brush and floss after every meal - something that may have prevented this cavity had I done so in the past. Even still, until I recently started not chewing on that side, I would get a tart taste in my mouth, I assume from the fermentation of whatever sugars and starches made their way into the cavity. I've had a pit cavity in a pre-molar that my dentist says we should watch, so he seems reasonably conservative with treatment.\n\nI've read some about giving cavities the right conditions to heal, but based on the Wikipedia article on tooth decay, dentin reacts to cavities by growing toward the pulp, not toward the surface. That article says once a cavity has formed, it must be filled. I've read other things that say that small cavities can heal, making the question is my cavity small enough? I can't actually see it, and I don't have the experience to say it's small, even if I could see it. The risk of waiting is that it only get worse, leading to a deeper filling or a root canal.\n\nThanks,\nScott"

For a more definitive answer, a radiograph would be required as well.\nNot all tooth wear associated areas are treated by fillings.

It is natural to show less teeth, the older you get.\nOn the photo it is clear though, that you are not giving the biggest smile possible. These days, with proper planning and crowns or composite build ups, you can increase the amount of teeth shown. Proper planning is very important, so I would recommend seeing a dentist that specializes in prosthodontic make overs."

This tooth gave the most pain and was the last to heal.  The bump has been there a very long time, it used to be sore to touch until the RCT treatment, now it's painless but I think it is causing some kind of pressure.  I think the bump was created when the canal of the tooth clogged up, like some kind of way to get around the blocked canal.  \n\n\nThe bump is around the width of my finger which is 2cm, it feels solid to the touch but feels like sticks out quite a bit.  I am wondering what is this bump and can/should I get it removed somehow?

I could describe it better Dr M: It is a bit unclear on the picture. My main concern is that this might be a draining sinus of a possible peri-apical infection, which might indicate root canal failure. On the photo this does not appear to be the case. I would still just mention this to your dentist, during your next check-up, so that he can double check to make sure everything is normal aindriu80: oh I see, well the lump was there before the root canal but I think it's linked to the cause of the root canal somehow.  I will mention it to the dentist next time but can a dentist remove something like this or would a doctor be required?  it used to hurt before the root canal but is ok now, it feels like something kinda foreign though, Dr M: There is a chance that is also just a bony protrusion, which does not require any intervention.

Towards the end of the procedure he cut and removed the thread, I can't remember if he removed it before he applied the silicone or before ... I'll take a wild guess and say that the thread was some sort of delimiter or marker for the silicone mould, I just don't know.\nThis procedure was apparently to have some gold teeth fitted (I suffer from bruxism) which will be later be adjusted and infused with some porcelain to make them partially more aesthetically pleasing. I had some provisional ceramic teeth fitted  (which are in now but are temporary) but they only required a silicon or alginate  mould which required no anasthetic or thread around  and into the gums. Dr M: Good day\nIt sounds like your dentist used some sort of retraction cord or similar product. This is mainly used when crowns are done, in order to \" push away\" the gum tissue, so that more accurate impressions can be taken of the margins of the tooth preparation. It is also used in order to halt bleeding and prevent moisture from contaminating the impression."

Classic signs of a dry socket include pain, foul taste and smell in the mouth, and usually it happens 3 to 5 days after an extraction.It is more common in bottom teeth.

Today I bought a dental mirror to have a look and there is no clot, no visible bone or anything and no pain but there is a big hole where it used to be. If I don’t have the pain it’s not dry socket but it’s not closed either so it hasn’t healed, then what’s going on? \n\nI also had a bottom molar taken out which hasn’t closed up yet and still has visible clot, that seems a long time? It’s taking longer to heal near a little bone spur, is that going to hinder the healing?\n\nLastly I have a little painful white spot next to my bottom wisdom tooth, next to the molar I had taken out. Hoping this is a canker sore and not bone spur (it’s along way from the extraction site though)\n\nAny help would be much much appreciated \n\nThanks a lot \n\nJohn Dr M: Good day\n\nFull closure of an extraction socket could take up to one month to close up. If there is no pain, I would suggest just being a little more patient."

I don’t have dental insurance and feel scared about going to my dentist and getting a big bill. Dr M: Good day\nDifficult to say without any clinical views. With any trauma, there is the possibility of a crack, but it could also just be an injured periodontal ligament. I would suggest sticking to a soft diet for about 1 week, and then also to take some anti-inflammatory medicine. If the pain does not subside within 2 weeks, go to see a dentist for further evaluation and x-rays."

    "dialogue": "ZDundun: I have a few very sensitive parts on some teeth that fall right along the base of the tooth where it meets the gum-line. That is, either on the very top of the tooth (top row) or bottom of the tooth (bottom row). Brushing over those parts of these teeth produces a sharp pain on contact (they feel like cavities). The remaining surface area of those teeth feel otherwise normal.\n\nI recently had an x-ray done at a dentist visit, but it didn't pick up any of the mentioned teeth as cavities. I scheduled a second opinion at another dentist, and she suggested that the reason why they might be hurting is because I'm not wearing my retainer every night, which causes the teeth to shift and therefore cause pain in those areas. I wore braces for 2 years, and my habit since then was to wear a night-time retainer every other day. Since that last visit and her suggestion to not skip on wearing it, I've been wearing my retainer every night, but my teeth still hurt just the same.\n\nIs it possible that for an x-ray to be wrong and not catch cavities? Based on my description, do the teeth I mentioned sound like they are cavities, or is it really true that if I continue to wear my retainer every night the sensitivity will eventually dissipate?"

It’s mainly the mound of grainy dark blood clot I’m worried about instead of it being level with the gum line. Will this mean the gum has to grow over it upwards?

I've done some very basic research into laser treatment and, from what I've read, it seems promising but I'm no expert.\n\nUp until the pandemic I had an NHS dentist. I contacted them for my annual check up during the first lockdown and was told that they weren't seeing patients. Next time I contacted them they told me that because it was now more than two years since my last check up that I was no longer on their list.\n\nToday I visited a new dentist who for £400, took x rays of my mouth, took samples to identify the types of bacteria present in my mouth and a general check up.\n\nThey have recommended that before laser treatment I have my teeth cleaned by their hygienist. The quoted cost for two sessions is c£750 which seems like, well, a lot. This is before knowing how much the laser treatment will be. They have given me a rough idea and it rolls into several thousand pounds.\n\nMy local private dentist has a hygienist who charges £80 per 40 minute session and I am wondering if there is a big difference and if so, what that is. I obviously want to save money if I can. The new dentist would prefer that I used them for the cleaning but they weren't really able to quantify how their cleaning is any different to a local dentist. They also told me that their hygienist has only been there for a year which was a bit of a concern considering the price.\n\nI really want to get my gums to a place where I can get orthodontic work done as my mouth is very crowded and I'm committed to getting them sorted ASAP\n\nIs laser treatment effective? Would using the cheaper hygienist be a bad idea?

    "dialogue": "dantevn: Hey folks. The tooth in question, if I read the chart right, is #29 (second bicuspid). Went to the dentist 3 months ago, she said there was a tiny, barely noticable hole from decay. Didn't even feel pain myself, but figured I should get it sorted out ASAP, before it widens. So she gets the drill, to widen it so she can fill it I guess , and I get an extremely painful zap through my entire body. Felt those before, but only with really badly decayed teeth. So I ask for an anesthetic. She applies a topical one (some spray I think, or a dripper, I forgot). Tries the drill again. Extremely painful, yet again. She's confused, because the decay is basically non existent, but agrees. So I get some special needle that goes waaaay back in my jaw - she says it's different because it's the lower jaw. Alright. She gives me that painful shot, and after some 10 minutes or so, I can feel my jaw tingling, and tounge going a bit numb. She tries the drill again. Extremely painful, again. Now both of us are confused, because the anesthesia worked, but it did nothing to the pain in the tooth. I know I'm not immune to it, I had much work done and it worked every time. She waits a bit more, for anesthetic to get stronger I assume. We try again, same deal. We book another day, and she applies some cure or whatever, I think its supposed to seal it or kill the nerve. Except it did nothing weeks later, as I can't chew on that side now, thanks to her half finished work. The day of the 2nd visit comes, and its a repeat of the first. Anesthetic doesn't work, she applies some cure on it again. 3rd visit approaching in 8 days. I still can't chew on that side due to pain to hot, cold or any pressure. I fear the anesthetic won't work again. She told me to bare through it, as it would take her only 2 mins to widen it, but that's a no go since it hurts REALLY BAD. I had a surgery without anesthesia done on my finger, without letting a sound, so I can manage pain, but this is insane. She doesn't get what's going on, as the decay is really small and it shouldn't hurt at all, let alone like that. Is there anything I can do prior to my visit, so it doesn't end up the same?

I would ideally like to go  for a full titanium implant. Unfortunately there are no options to get a  Titanium Crown as my dentist only works with Zirkonia crowns.\n\nFrom  what I have been reading on the internet, the Zirkonia implants are   usually one piece. How does that fit in with my situation. I am completly confused as even when I google Zirkonia crowns vs Titanium Crowns I get search results for full Zirkonia implants (1 piece). \n\nDo I get it correctly that what my dentist is offering me is basically an implant from Straumann which is 3 pieces   (Implant+Abutment both Titanium) but the crown only from Zirkonia? In case (years later) the crown fractures, as I understand Zirkonia is more   brittle than metal/titanium, will I have the option of replacing it with a titanium crown? Will the entire Implant need to be replaced?\n\nAny and all help is appreciated.\nThank you very much"

Not sure how much novocaine I got, but it was probably more than I've ever gotten before.\n\nBasically, I was feeling a lot of pain during the beginning of the drilling on the cracked tooth, when they were removing silver filling material. I let them know and we did two more rounds of novocaine (since it happened twice). It turned out to be that my tooth directly above that one, which had a recent crown and needs a root canal, was actually causing referred pain just from the cool water and suction. The pain appeared to me to be coming from the bottom, where they were drilling.\n\nI had one of those squares that is put between the teeth to keep the mouth open since I have TMJ and a difficult time keeping it open. It felt like it stretched the muscles too far, there was a ripping kind of pain. I had some minor lockjaw afterwards - today is 2 days later and it's starting to loosen up. I can open about an inch now, whereas initially afterwards I could open maybe half an inch. \n\nThe thing that has been concerning is I am having sensations of numbness. Mostly I felt it on my cheek skin, sometimes near the side of the skull. The cheek tissue itself looks a little plumper. I normally have a thin face and low body fat, but one of my cheeks looks a bit fatter and saggy at the moment. Pretty mild, not too noticeable. \n\nI'm wondering if there is a chance there was some kind of nerve damage, or if this is a normal response to maybe too much novocaine. I'm a bit nervous that maybe one of the injections hit a nerve? Would love some kind of feedback to give me peace of mind that this is normal and will pass. honestdoc: You're right to have concerns of possible nerve damage because of your residual numbness.  It is very rare to have permanent nerve damage from anesthesia.  The nerve has a lot of potential to heal so I anticipate full nerve recovery and sensation. shouldabeenflossing: Thank you so much for the reply. I am feeling slightly less numbness today and my mouth has been able to open an extra quarter inch since posting.

I do not drink or smoke cigarettes but I do vape (D8 THC). Here is a link to my xrays.\n\nI went to the dentist this week for the first time in over five years. I have a major dental phobia I'm working through. In that time my wisdom teeth have decayed and obviously need to be removed. The dentist I saw is not the one who will be removing the teeth, he was in the middle of a procedure while I was there so I wasn't able to ask questions. I would like to know if there are any reasons I should use an oral surgeon instead of a general dentist for the removal, like proximity to a nerve or sinus, etc. The codes on the estimate for the removal are all surgical extractions, does this mean the teeth are impacted? They seem to be fully erupted to me. Just looking for some other opinions on if I need a surgeon or not. I am also scheduled to have two cavities filled in December - does this look about right based on my bite wings? And last question, what's up with my front tooth looking black in the panoramic xray? Thanks for any advice you can provide! honestdoc: General dentists have varied skill sets and experience levels.  I've been fortunate to recognize which cases I will pursue and those I will refer.  Looking at your x-rays, the top wisdom teeth should come out fairly quick with minimal trauma.  I usually code D7140 simple extractions since many of them come out less than 5 min.  The bottom ones will be tougher due to the jaw bone being more difficult and many times removal of bone (surgical) and sectioning the top crown may be needed.  The tooth appear to tip and will exit distally (away from the midline) which can be more difficult as well.  The dentist (or surgeon) may code soft tissue impaction (more expensive) but should not code partial bony or fully bony impactions.  If they do, they are ripping you or your insurance off."

    "dialogue": "alsomtime: I have been to several dentists and doctors that may be negligent, so I would appreciate some advice/guidance. \n\nSo here goes.... I started having a tooth infection in February or March 2021, and I took an antibiotic for it (amoxicillin and then clindamycin because I was allergic), which successfully alleviated the pain. I neglected seeing the dentist until it came back two times over the summer, both times I took clindamycin for. The dentist told me I needed to have all four of my wisdom teeth extracted. I got them out as soon as possible, in late August. \n\nThe extraction other than the fact that my infection came back in full force afterwards. My lymph nodes were swollen and the pain was radiating throughout my jaw. I received another antibiotic (clindamycin), and then moved away for school, and had to wait a while before I had dental insurance in my state. As soon as the antibiotic wore off, the infection came back. I found a dental clinic that would take me at a lower cost before my insurance was sorted out, and they told me my bottom left tooth, #19, would need a root canal. I also was told I'd need 6-7 fillings. I bit the bullet and bought the insurance, but in the meantime before I was able to get the work done, the infection came back so bad I went to urgent care one night and they gave me another course of clindamycin (and at this point I was convinced I'm resistant to clindamycin because of all the times I've had it). \n\nFast forward a few weeks and my dental insurance was sorted out, so I went to an endodontist to have my root canal procedure done. I also got those fillings done (which, by the way, were probably done wrong because I can no longer floss in between those teeth). A few days later, the infection was still there. I had gone to urgent care a second time, and they gave me a shot of Rocephin, but it did not relieve me much. I went in to the endodontist to get my tooth retreated. Going in for the root canal retreatment, I had a sneaking suspicion that the tooth was cracked anyway and would need to be extracted... but they insisted retreatment was the way to go. I got retreated, and they gave me a new antibiotic, Azithromycin, as well as some Medrol for the pain radiating into my ear. \nA few nights later, I heard a popping sound and had an intense throbbing in my jaw. My tooth had cracked to the root. And at this point, the infection was so bad that it was keeping me up at night, with pain in my jaw, neck, lymph nodes, ear, head, and chest. I got referred to an oral surgeon to get the tooth extracted as soon as possible. \n\nI received the tooth extraction on October 20th, and they sent me home with another course of clindamycin. That night was the worst I've ever felt the infection. I was coughing all night, and the pain seemed to radiate throughout my whole left side and chest (and a little on the right). I tried the Hydrocodone they gave me and was alternating it with Ibuprofen, but I was fatigued, heart was beating fast, and felt short of breath and dizzy at night. The highest my fever got was 99.1. \nA few days ago, I went back to the oral surgeon because I have a bump underneath the skin on my jaw next to the extraction site. I also went to another dentist to get a second opinion. They both told me that I should stop taking courses of antibiotics because at this point they aren't helping. They said the bump is probably a \"hematoma\" from the trauma of the surgery, and the extraction site looked good and healthy. The second dentist did also tell me I have a lot of cracks on my teeth and should get an occlusal guard to avoid clenching.\n\nMy question is this: are they correct that I don't need antibiotics anymore? I've always heard that infections do not go away on their own. I still feel infected, and there is still a bump under my jaw. Are the cracks causing infection in my mouth as well? Or am I just resistant to all antibiotics now and have no hope?\nI just don't know what to do anymore and it's literally so hard to get through the day when I feel this sick, and it's not like I've been neglecting professional care.."

There is no pain that I know of apart the sensation of shifting around in it's socket if I happen to (accidentally) chew with it.\n\nWhile I would prefer to try and save the natural tooth before going down the extraction + implant route, what is the likelihood this tooth can be saved?

They usually do a tooth by tooth analysis, taking into consideration all local factors as well as systemic factors, to determine if a tooth can be saved or not. My opinion is always to try and save your own teeth when possible, because once a tooth is gone, it is gone for good.\nA proper deep root planing, treatment of any other underlying or contributing factors including adjusting the bite, might stabilize the tooth.

No way to regenerate the bone once it's lost they believe and went on to advise there was little hope in putting in an implant due to bone density issues.\n\nWill be interesting to see if other doctors feel the same way. Had the impression (rightly or wrongly) once any underlying disease process is controlled that bone grafting was a possibility to restore bone in that area, even in preparation for an implant."

The last couple of days I’ve been trying to dose down on my pain meds because I’m worried of the impact on my body. These last couple of days I’ve also been experiencing the worst pain I’ve had since extraction. The pain isn’t radiating into my temple or anything, it feels like a bad toothache in the teeth next to the extraction site. The extraction site doesn’t look bad In my opinion, it’s full of white and grey tissue and is slowly closing up. There’s no bad smell that I can notice and there’s not really any taste apart from saltiness. The pain meds get rid of the pain but when they start wearing off it’s back again. Dr M: Good day\nIt might be a sign of a dry socket, especially if the pain is becoming more severe. Although a dry socket is usually also accompanied by a bad taste or smell, it is not to say you have to have every one of the symptoms. I would go see my dentist to make sure all is in order."

    "title": "Dying tooth question",
    "dialogue": "LarLa: Hello\n\nI have an appointment at my dentist tomorrow to remove an old silver filling to see what's been happening with one of my 1st molars on the top. I chipped off a small piece of the tooth years ago and the dentist filled it down a bit so it wasn't sharp (x-rays, examination showed nothing other than the small chip on the inner edge). Around 6 - 8 months ago I bit something hard and had pain for a bit. I didn't really think anything of it as it went away but I asked my dentist at my regular appointment in May - she did xrays and looked closely at the filling and it looked fine. Dentist said it was probably ligaments around the tooth and they had healed. I ended up biting something hard again at the end of July and ended up with worse pain then I had before so I went back to the dentist. Xrays, exam, tap test, bite test were all good and she thought either inflammation or cracks in the filling. I was given a prescription mouthwash and told to come back in a week if it didn't get better. It got better at that time so I didn't go back until around 2 weeks ago when I had some pain again. They did xrays again (fine) and didn't see any obvious cracks in my tooth or filling. But I failed the cold test and was told the nerve in the tooth was dying. They can't really see what's going on until the filling is removed and hopefully then the tooth can be saved with a root canal. She did mention that if they find a crack below the gumline then it would be an extraction (I've been stressing about that ever since honestly).\n\nWhat could have made my tooth die like that? I have other old fillings that I ask about at every appointment to have checked and they look good. Could the filling have gotten loose over the years? Is it a cracked tooth? The tooth isn't loose and isn't typically in pain. It does feel sensitive sometimes when I run my tongue over it. This is my first root canal and I'm a little freaked out. Tks. honestdoc: Every tooth has a fragile nerve that can get traumatized and injured.  Having a filling/dental work or getting hit in the mouth can injure the nerve.  When the nerve gets injured, it can get better (reversible pulpitis) or become permanently damaged (irreversible pulpitis) or die (necrosis).  It seems that you are injuring your tooth frequently so hopefully you and your dentist can figure that out. MattKW: Teeth  can \"die\" from deep decay, or cracks, or trauma (hit in mouth). Most cracks occur in teeth that have been previously weakened by decay and fillings. Cracks do not show up on Xrays - they are usually diagnosed by your symptoms and history of the tooth. \nA negative cold test means that the nerve (pulp) has died. If there is a crack, then as long as it doesn't go below the gum surface then usually a Root Canal Therapy (RCT) and a crown will preserve the tooth. This is everyday dentistry and is no big deal apart from the cost and time involved. If the crack goes below the gum, then it would have to be extracted. LarLa: Thank you for your answers. They did the first stage of the root canal not long after that post and my second appointment is this Wednesday. They did find a small crack under the filling but it wasnt below the gum line but Ill be getting a crown. The removed filling was apparently deep. I have been having some discomfort high on my gums by that tooth (at or near where the gum meets the lip). As far as I can tell it isnt red but its tender to touch. Hopefully it'll get straightened out on Wednesday."

    "title": "Brushing and Flossing Advice",
    "dialogue": "lost_in_translation: My wife seems cavity prone (especially between teeth), she doesn't drink soda or fruit juices.  We don't think her diet is terrible but she does snack sometimes.\n\nAs she was getting cavities between her teeth she started flossing almost every night and has been for the last ~2 years, she brushes morning and night with a Sonicare toothbrush and uses a fluoride antibacterial rinse ~3-4 times a week at night.\n\nRecently she just had another cavity filled that was between two teeth. Her mood seems quite down as she thought there was no way she would get another cavity. \n\nShe asked the dentist what she could do and he just said to brush after each meal and to floss.  We think that seems a little bit much as we will brush before bed that seems like it would be 4 times a day (3 meals plus before bed).  She already has some recession from brushing which we wouldn't like to make worse by overdoing it.  \n\nShe thought she could add brushing after lunch (which would end up being 3 times a day).\n\nI thought that since a toothbrush can't really clean in between teeth and that is where she is getting cavities (literally all of them since in the last 5 years or more) it might be better to floss after lunch and use antibacterial fluoride rinse as she already cleans where a toothbrush can clean twice a day but only flosses once day (so 24 hours between flossing would become more like 12 hours).\n\nMy question is, in your opinion, which of the two options would be more beneficial?\n\nThanks honestdoc: She needs Sodium Fluoride 5000 ppm toothpaste in addition to normal Crest/Colgate.  Use the 5000 ppm as a leave in gel.  Any beverage with sugar/acid/cream like Starbucks, Red Bull, energy drinks, etc will cause severe teeth deterioration.  Conditions like acid reflux and or dry mouth from various medications can contribute to deterioration as well.  I also find many dentists do unnecessary fillings. mikerusselltw: Hi, thank you for your reply  Sorry for the long message, lots of questions\n\nI am living in my wife's country so the language isn't native to me. We have not been able to get 5000ppm toothpaste. Standard here is 1450opm.  It seems not available or they don't want to prescribe it. I have found that you can order from overseas 2500ppm and ship it here.\n\n225ppm and 900ppm fluoride mouth rinse is available here though.\n\nNot sure what you mean as a leave in gel, we don't rinse with water after brushing if that is what you mean.\n\nShe doesn't drink soda, red bull, we have our own coffee machine and next to it is a container of xylitol, not sugar.\n\nShe isn't on any medication and no evidence of reflux. Dry mouth she isn't aware of having but it's a possibility I guess.\n\nIt's been 5 fillings in the last 8 years (all in between teeth) although up until 2 years ago she never flossed.\n\nI agree with your feeling about unnecessary fillings, we struggle to find a dentist we like here, and the culture here seems to be go to whichever is convenient at the time instead of sticking with an office.  I have said we should find one we like and stick to going there.  They will also usually only take the whole mouth x-ray where it spins around your head and not the left and right ones that I expect and I have been told are necessary to properly check in between teeth unless you ask and even then it's hit or miss whether they will agree to.\n\nWe were frustrated with our last dentist office  as they said they would take x-rays every 12 months but after 18 months they still hadn't taken them again, they rushed us through and when my wife asked about x-rays they seemed unwilling, saying next time. They had told my wife she had the start of a cavity between a lower tooth but it was stable and not progressing even though it looked brown. \n\nWe went to a new office this time and they did the usual whole mouth x-ray but my wife told the dentist she had previously had cavities between teeth and that she wanted him to check the one that was brown and that the last office had told her it didn't need treatment.  He then took the extra left and right x-rays and agreed that it didn't need treatment but told her that she had a cavity on at the back of a top tooth (in between) that would need filled. He pointed it out on the x-ray.\n\nWe didn't get a picture of the x-ray but we had taken pictures of my wife's x-rays at the previous dentist office 12 and 18 months before. Taking a look at that exact tooth we could see something at the same area he mentioned in both the previous x-rays.  We are not sure the previous office missed it, or didn't think it needed treatment.  It could be the new office is more agressive to treat it.  We don't know and my wife was feeling frustrated by this as she didn't want something done if it was unnecessary.\n\nBut we did like the dentists manner and my wife was happy that he was willing to take the extra x-rays when asked.\n\nShe did get the cavity filled in the end.\n\nWe are hoping this latest cavity was started back when she was not flossing in the past and that hopefully this is the last and thhat she  won't any more cavities in future.\n\n\nThanks"

Medicaid only provides basic services depending on each state.

Although dairy has important nutrients, it does have lactose sugars that can cause cavities (think baby bottle rot).  The Sodium Fluoride 5000 ppm will help control the incipient caries.

    "dialogue": "linz: Hi all,\nI'm 27 and I got all 4 wisdom teeth extracted 8 days ago. \n2 days after the surgery, I noticed that the right side of my tongue was numb and alternated between a burning and prickly or tingly sensation. Also, the whole floor of my mouth (where my saliva comes out) and underside of my tongue felt swollen and burning which was very uncomfortable. It continued to last. \n\nI went to another dentist to get an opinion because the dentist who did the surgery was very uncommunicative and didn't make me feel safe during the procedure. (She was yelling at her assistant in a foreign language near the end of the surgery, so it seemed like she messed something up). This other dentist conducted an x-ray and saw that I had a nerve close to the lower right tooth extraction site. My original dentist did not inform me of this before the surgery, and that really upsets me because although I signed papers acknowledging the risks, I feel like I was not able to make an informed choice. \n\nEventually, I did go back to the original dentist to ask her about the nerve, and she acknowledged that she had seen it on the x-ray. However, she said that there was no difficulty extracting that particular tooth (I do remember that the lower left one took way longer and seemed to be stuck, compared to the lower right). \nOn day 7 post-op, the floor of my mouth no longer felt swollen and the right side of my tongue felt more normal/ seems to have regained sensation, although the tip and side still feels some prickles/burning. \nAlso, the numbness seems to have shifted to my right inner gums. The gum feels quite numb but if I touch the gums with my nail, I feel a slight pain sensation. The back of my tongue hurts/ feels like it's straining when I talk a lot. \n\nThe dentist said that my nerve will most likely heal in a few months and prescribed more steroids. But I'm wondering:\nIs it a good sign if I feel burning/prickling rather than just numbness?\nCould the straining in my tongue when I talk a lot be related to the nerve?\nIs it good sign that the numbness has shifted from one place to another?\nWould high-dose Vitamin B and C supplements help with nerve recovery?\nGiven the fact that my dentist said that the tooth was not wrapped around the nerve, is it very unlikely that the nerve was completely severed? Dr M: Good day\n\nInferior Alveolar nerve damage is one of the most common complications, when removing wisdom teeth. Usually if there is a chance that the nerve can be involved, a referral to an oral surgeon is recommended for the removal of the teeth.\nThe nerve can sometimes be damaged due to mechanical trauma of the injection or the extraction itself. If the nerve was completely severed, you would most likely not have experienced a burning or prickling sensation.\nIt would be my opinion that the nerve got \" bruised \". The inferior alveolar nerve also has branches that supply the lateral border of the tongue on the affected side.\nThis damage could be permanent, semi-permanent or transient.\nNerve damage can sometimes take up to a year to resolve. Sometimes even longer.\nThe fact that you have numbness that is decreasing in certain areas, as well as a burning sensation and sometimes even a pins and needles feeling, might be a sign of healing taking place.\nI have seen some success with patients taking Vitamin B supplements that help to speed up nerve regeneration, but in the end, only time will tell if the damage is permanent or not.\nAll of this should have been part of the informed consent process that was discussed with you, prior to the extractions taking place."

Dr M: Good day\n\nIt could be an area where you are chronically biting your cheeks or gum tissue, even unknowingly, causing scar tissue formation and hypertrophy or enlargement of tissues in the area. If this issue persists, I would recommend removing your wisdom teeth."

    "dialogue": "Tamms0647: Hello. On a routine cleaning this past Friday at a new dentist, I discovered I have a fractured front tooth and was told to come back for an emergency consultation. Now, I am 24, healthy, and had absolutely no idea this was even an issue on tooth #10 as it is below the gum line--what I would consider a \"sub-crestal coronal root fracture\" from research. I went back and talked to the surgeon, and he prompted that I should go for a bone graft and implant. After doing extensive research between the initial findings and this appointment, I was curious to know why there was no options for a shot at restoring this tooth, as I'd rather not do an implant for cost reasons--given I'm in NYC, I am hoping to find a second opinion sometime later in the week on this case, or maybe a good recommendation for a dentist in the city or surrounding area. Thanks so much. Tamms0647: Photos attached Dr M: Good day\n\nUnfortunately sub-crestal means that it is below the bone level. If you tried to restore this, you would have to remove the crown part, and then do a root canal treatment with a post and crown, but this would present with several issues. Because it is below the bone, there would be no seal , and the root canal will have constant issues with regards to micro leakage etc.  Also due to the fracture, there would be no ferrule, as well as an unfavorable root-crown ratio, leading to fracture of the remaining root part.\nI agree with your dentist-in my opinion, extraction with immediate implant placement, with additional bone grafts, or even the recently published socket shield technique, would give you the best outcome.

Dr M: Good day\n\nIt sounds like what you have is recurrent episodes of apthous ulcers. This is an auto-immune mediated condition, with flare-ups that last for 10-14 days. Triggers can be stress or, in your case, your weakend immune system due to the ongoing sickness for the past months. I would consider seeing a medical doctor about treating the cause of the ongoing illness, drink lots of multi-vitamins in order to help boost the immune system, and then apply some Kenalog in Orobase on the lesions, once they appear in order to limit the pain symptoms experienced. MattKW: This is very unlikely to be apthous ulcers which normally develop on soft tissue. More likely this is a viral issue, probably herpes  (HSV-1).

Signs that you may need a RCT are intense pain that wakes you a night and or swelling around the tooth.  The particular molar you indicated is very difficult to do a RCT because of it's anatomy.  Too often I see RCTs on that molar fail because the anatomy is not thoroughly cleaned and sealed.  RCT on that molar should be the last resort done by an experienced dentist preferably an endodontist with microscopic magnification."

    "dialogue": "MangoBango89: Hi. A few years ago my top left 3rd molar started breaking and eventually completely fell out, leaving what felt like sharp fragments behind. It was infected, which I stupidly treated myself with diluted hydrogen peroxide rinses and Thieves (clove) oil. I saw a dentist in '18 and was to have those remaining roots removed, but never did get around to it. Around the same time, my bottom left 3rd molar had a chunk break off. It didn't hurt, and I didn't do anything about it. A couple months ago I noticed a huge cary in that bottom molar, and both the top roots and bottom tooth were aching at times, sometimes severely but briefly and intermittently. I had them extracted on July 9. Both upper and lower were infected. My left throat hurt when I swallowed for a while, which I read is normal. I've had other symptoms, too, like fullness/aching in my left ear, aching in my left neck, tinnitus which isn't new but has been worse in my left ear, mild aching in my left lower occiput, occasional dull frontal and left headaches and light-headedness, which are not new with my chronic allergies/sinuses. All of these have improved but remain. I still feel \"something\" around my left ear/throat, especially when I swallow. Is that normal? I'm 53. Dr M: Good day\n\nHave all your decayed teeth been removed? Do you have any new x-rays? Might be that you have additional cavities that you are not aware of. Dr M: Also make sure you don't perhaps have an upper respiratory tract infection or other medical condition, for which you will have to see a medical doctor. MangoBango89: I have more cavities to be filled. I'm going to get a pano X-ray today. A neck ultrasound and CT recently showed a lymph node near my left jaw that was hypoechoic and has no fatty hilum, so that's very concerning to me. However, the CT report did say that the surrounding fat stranding suggests reactive adenopathy, and everyone seemed to think it was related to the teeth since they were on the left side and clearly infected. I'm also having a repeat EGD done in August for some esophageal polyps that had eosinophils in them, and a repeat neck ultrasound in September, but I might ask for it to be done sooner. I'm just looking for anything to cling to because I'm afraid of cancer. Overall, symptoms have improved though, so that's a good sign, right? MangoBango89: Thank you for responding, Dr. M. MangoBango89: I should add that I had a pano X-ray done, but my dentist offered to do another one free just to check for abscesses. Dr M: It is a good sign yes. I would still have all the cavities fixed, to rule out any dental origins for your symptoms, before jumping to cancer. MangoBango89: Just when I said symptoms have improved, today it seemed the aching (and sometimes it feels kind of like burning or a cool sensation) was worse in my left ear and around the left lower occiput down into the trapezius, and my head just feels kinda funny, sinus pressure and a little light-headed. Could it just be nerve damage/inflammation/infection (+ anxiety probably)? I still have some aching in the left ear and under my left jaw sometimes. Sometimes the teeth around the empty sockets ache. Not terribly but just ache intermittently. I still feel something in my left throat when I swallow, but not like I did right after the extraction. I got the pano done, but my dentist isn't in until Monday. My husband died of cancer about 10 years ago at age 44, and we still have a kid at home, so I'm just really nervous about that. I haven't taken the greatest care of myself over the last decade but am trying to now. Thanks for listening."

    "dialogue": "drmajidghiasi: hi everyone\n\nWhat are the symptoms of infected teeth? Except for severe pain and inflammation, there is another sign?\nthx MattKW: You mean like abscessed teeth? honestdoc: Symptoms can vary but almost always swelling.  There must be a route/cause of infection in a tooth.  Every tooth has a root canal/nerve center.  Causes can be trauma and or braces, cavities, fracture, deep fillings, and/or extensive restorations like crowns/bridges.  I've encountered a tooth without trauma or cavities with a pulpal infection.  The tooth (Lower premolar/bicuspid) had its biting surface invaginating inward exposing micro pathways for bacterial infiltration.   \n\nOn x-ray, a tooth can appear to have an infection.  With asymptomatic infection, the tooth is necrotic and will not feel cold.  If the tooth is vital, the bony lesion could be cemento-osseous dysplasia which is benign.\n\nTreatment for an infected tooth is to save it with a root canal procedure (more expensive) or tooth extraction. MangoBango89: One of my top teeth fell out, and I neglected to have the roots removed for a few years. It had started hurting again, but I don't know as there was any swelling. There was infection at the tip of the roots (is periapical the correct term?). And a bottom molar had a chunk break off and later developed a huge cavity. I had it pulled and the upper roots, too. The dentist said something about the amount of infection correlating with the amount of decay in the tooth, and said it was pretty much infected to the bone (the bottom tooth). It hurt, also, but I'm not sure about swelling. The left side of my face was a bit warmer than the right though. Just my experience. My tinnitus worsened on the left. My left ear felt full and ached a little, and the left side of my neck ached, too. I can't remember if the ear and neck aching started before or after they were pulled though. Dumb, I know. ha. \n\nThat's interesting that there can be pulpal infection without trauma or cavities."

I had never experienced any pain or sensitivity in the tooth prior to the filling, but after the filling I have suffered considerable discomfort when applying pressure to the tooth. For instance, chewing on solids (eg nuts, cracker, chewy bread) triggers nerve pain in the centre of the tooth. I can recreate this experience by applying pressure to the centre of the tooth with my finger nail. I have no pain or sensitivity to hot or cold. It has been three months since the procedure.\n\nI have had the bite checked and there are no issues there.\n\nMy questions are:\n1) what are the possible issues I am experiencing?\n2) the only unusual process that took place during my filling was that my dentist forgot she had double-booked, and left me with the bond on my tooth and blue light on for about 5 minutes while she saw another patient, which is much longer than usual. Could this result in the bond not adhering properly to the tooth?\n\nThank you for your help! Dr M: Good day\n\nIt is not the norm to leave the curing light on a tooth for 5 minutes. There is such a thing as over-curing. A curing light consists out of ultra violet light of various intensities. There is some evidence to show that prolonged constant exposure to a curing light with a high intensity, might lead to pulpitis or even nerve necrosis. \nIt is also possible that while you were waiting for the dentist, moisture contamination could have occurred, leading to insufficient bond to the tooth structure, causing sensitivity.\nComposite fillings also undergo polymerization shrinkage over time, leading to post-op sensitivity.\nMy advice would be to either have the filling replaced with a new composite filling, or to have a zinc oxide eugenol temporary filling placed, that has sedative properties, in order to monitor the symptoms on the tooth first. It can then be determined if there is any nerve damage or not, and if there is, it can be handled appropriately."

Sutures on the tongue is very tricky though.\nHe can also prescribe you an anti-septic mouth rinse as well as antibiotics if it is indicated clinically. boavao: Thank you for your reply and your effort to help me but as far as i see it didn't heal properly and now there's a gap that hurts at the end because it fires a nerve.

But, May 17, it came back, at the same spot, with pain, and with a hole. Then may 23 I went to the doctor, but he doesnt know whats this. He gave me a medicine for dental infection and told me that hes not sure if this is really just a canker sore because those kind of normal sore doesn't usually take place there. But yeah, he gave me antibiotics. And im still drinking it, its my 4th day. And the pain is slowly getting away also the hole is like getting smaller. But Im still nervous, because I dont know what exactly this is. And I read so many articles about mouth cancer, so Im getting paranoid. And also, what if it healed then come back again.\n\nI hope theres someone here who can tell me what this is and this is not a serious thing. Thank youu. Dr M: Good day\n\nDo perhaps have a history of trauma to the area like biting your cheeks or a sharp tooth or filling that keeps scratching the area?\nDo determine if a lesion is cancerous or dysplastic, a biopsy needs to be taken. The dentist can refer you to an oral surgeon if the area doesn't heal, and he/she is not confident to do it themself.\nThe white lesions could be normal keratotic areas or \" scar tissue \", but also might be leukoplakia which has the potential of being a pre-malignant indicator.\nBest to have it checked out in my opinion. Lay: I dont have that kind of history. And I already went to a doctor but he doesn't know also and told me he have a dentist son so maybe I can check this out with a dentist after I finished the med that the doctor gave me. Im really getting paranoid but as I was checking the info about oral cancer or something and read the 'causes', I dont do that, i dont smoke and I only drink like 4 times so im getting really confused as to why will I have this. And I dont think we have oral surgeon here near my area. And its still pandemic, so yeah. Anyways thank you for replying. I really hope this is nothing serious\n\nAnother thing, the hole is getting smaller and pain is slowly going away. Im taking Amoxiclav, btw.  And I dont smoke and Im not a heavy drinker, I only drink alcohol few times. Should I still think this is serious? Or just a big canker sore just like what I've read on the other post in this forum.? Dr M: Good day\n\nI would still see a dentist then, since most dentist can at least do a biopsy of the area. I don't think it is only a canker sore and the pigment area is also somewhat worrying.\nRather have the lesion biopsied to be on the safe side. Lay: Yes. Thats what Im planning to do. Whether it healed or not after the medicine. I will still see a dentist, I wanna know what exactly is this. Thank you so much. Lay: Doc, I just want to know if my tonsils are normal. The other side of my tonsil is bigger than the other one. Though i have colds but i dont have runny nose.

    "title": "Enamel Erosion Is Altering My Speech And Driving Me Crazy - Please Help",
    "dialogue": "DentalProblem1: Hi everyone,\n\nThis is a very long post so thank you for your time in advance. I genuinely appreciate any help whatsoever.\n\nMy problem:\n\nEnamel erosion on on the back of my front teeth has resulted in problems with my speech. I do not use tobacco at all and never have.\n\nQuick synopsis:\n\nI drank a minimum of two Mountain Dew Kickstarts every day and failed to consistently brush my teeth for approximately four years and it led to widespread enamel erosion. The kicker is that my lower right central incisor naturally protrudes and makes direct contact with the back of my upper right incisor when I attempt to close my mouth. Essentially, my dysfunctional tooth structure created an abrasion that coupled with my poor hygiene and diet to compound the erosion within that specific part of my mouth - I.E. the top right incisor.\n\nConsequently, my upper right incisor is significantly more concaved than the rest of my teeth and has yielded somewhat of a - I almost don't know how to phrase this - pseudo gap in my mouth when I attempt to speak. It feels like my two front teeth are staggered and my tongue fails to make clean contact when pronouncing 't' and 'l' sounds. Additionally, the increased depth has created a growing hole between where my front teeth meet my gums at the roof of my mouth - directly below my frenulum - and now my 's' and 'sh' sounds are dragging and losing their sharpness. It's infuriating.\n\nIn summary: my tongue is being forced to strain itself to reach further when attempting to pronounce words or phrases and occasionally comes up with nothing, but air. I'm not dumb - I'm struggling immensely to speak with the efficiency, speed, and precision that I've grown accustomed to over thirty years.\n\nExamples:\n\n\"Fortunate enough\" now comes out like \"Fortun-eh enough\"\n\n\"Didn't\" often comes out like \"diiin't\"\n\n\"Hundred\" = \"Hundreh\"\n\n\"Transcripts\" = \"Transcrips\"\n\n\"Just\" = \"Juss\"\n\nUltimately, I'm struggling to make swift and precise contact with repetitive \"hard\" syllables because half of the point of contact that my tongue was using feels like it's missing.\n\nMy experiences with the dentist:\n\nMy family dentist dismissed my problem for almost a year, eventually decided to saw down my protruding incisor to remove the friction, and then later told me to get braces. This doesn't make any sense to me, though. To be clear, my bottom teeth no longer touch my top teeth AT ALL when I close my mouth. I understand that my bottom teeth require braces, but upper teeth are almost perfectly straight and braces seemingly can't re-create the volume that I've lost on my right incisor, no? I explicitly asked this question to my dentist and he told me to ask the orthodontist instead. When I asked the orthodontist the same question, he sort of evaded a direct answer by telling me that I could possibly require more procedures following the braces and wouldn't elaborate further. It feels like I'm stuck in an endless loop of both professionals referring me to the other for answers.\n\nIf logic seems to disagree with the use of braces and there is no discernible game plan then I don't think that spending $5,500 on Invisalign is an intelligent idea. I can't afford - financially or mentally - to endure another year of this. In the beginning, I assumed that adding a layer of resin onto the back of my tooth would correct the problem by replacing any lost volume, but my family dentist is inexplicably opposed to doing that. He simply shuts me down and refers me to the orthodontist every time that I bring it up.\n\nI visited a second dentist who acknowledged the issue and immediately agreed that utilizing resin was the way to go, but then kind of botched the execution. When I arrived for the procedure, she numbed my mouth, left the room, and allowed her assistant - apprentice? - to perform the task. Unfortunately, this person - who I had never met or spoken to at any time prior to this moment - cemented a glob of resin onto the bottom portion of my right incisor, but left the upper half of the tooth untouched - effectively creating a weird and bumpy tooth while failing to address the particularly problematic area near the frenulum. I can return to this dentist, but I'm a little sketched out by how nonchalantly they passed me off to a person whom I had never even met.\n\nAt the end of the day, I will be happy with any solution that fixes my issue - braces, resin, or otherwise - as long as there is a guaranteed plan of action and a detailed explanation of how it will fix my problem. I'm not taking a $5,500, 18-month-long leap of faith, though. \n\nMy questions:\n\nAre braces truly the answer here?\n\nIf so, how will they compensate for the lost volume that created my problem in the first place?\n\nIf not, why does my dentist seem to fear utilizing resin?\n\nPhotos:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEnamel Erosion\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nEnamel Erosion album hosted in ImgBB\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tibb.co\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nPhoto 1: A zoomed out view of everything. I apologize for the blur. \n\nPhoto 2: The line demonstrates the \"gap\" that I am talking about. When I speak, the left side of my tongue hits the left tooth and the right side falls into the highlighted area - often coming back with nothing, but air or a distorted version of the sound that is normally produced. \n\nPhoto 3: The left arrow points to the base of the glob of resin that was added to my tooth. The right arrow points to the growing gap below the frenulum. Two years ago, this area was a flat, airtight wall. \n\nPhoto 4/5: Unedited versions of photos two and three."

    "dialogue": "scooter514: We recently had ownership change in the dental practice we go to. Previously we never had this recommended, but the new dentist recommended we get additional work done as a preventative measure. For one of us, it was due to grinding teeth and some wear is developing and it would be to prevent additional erosion of enamel. For the other, there were some small holes or dips that he recommended get filled. \n\nNeither of us are experiencing pain or sensitivity even when the dentist prodded with the tool, and it was billed as a preventative measure by the dentist. Is this something that most dentists would recommend (obviously hard to tell without seeing us), or is it simply a way for the dentist to charge for unneeded procedures? I just find it odd since the prior dentist never recommended these procedures for years before, and then new treatments are recommended shortly after change in ownership. I also saw a review online from another prior patient who also complained about unnecessary procedures and fees that have happened after the sale of the dental practice, so it's hard to tell whether we should go ahead with the treatment or find a new dentist. Dr M: Good day\n\nFissure sealants are recommend in certain cases. If the patient has deep fissures, it can seal these fissures to prevent decay. If you have a carious molar, the other molars can be sealed to prevent decay. If there is poor patient compliance with regards to oral hygiene, then the fissures can be sealed. This is common practice with regards to the treatment of children, but also subject to patient finances and consent to the procedure.\nWith good oral hygiene practices, it is not a necessity to have fissure sealants done."

I have been worried about my teeth for quite a while, so have been doing everything (as far as I know) right to look after them, but it has still happened.\nI mentioned about the calculus on the back of my teeth to my dentist a few months ago, and she didn’t seem concerned. She gave me some prescription (duraphat) toothpaste and recommend a gum shield for grinding at night, but that was it, other than that, she was happy, where I think they look a real mess!\n\nI can see the darker root at the bottom now, and the gum doesn’t seem to fit tidy and snug around these teeth like it does on the rest. I’m 33 and a smoker trying to quit. It seems to early to be having these problems arising.\n\nIs there anything I should be, or can be, doing extra to prevent the gums from receding more?\n\nThanks, Phil. Busybee: You should ask your dentist to refer you to a periodontist. iamVilla: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tYou should ask your dentist to refer you to a periodontist. I mentioned it to her a few months back and she didn’t seem bothered, it was an initial consultation with a new dentist too, so she was very thorough. She just gave me some prescription (duraphat?) toothpaste, and recommended a night guard for my anxious grinding.\nIt’s the root showing that had scared me, but I’m not sure if I’m overreacting. I keep questioning what I’m doing wrong and what I should be doing to stop it.\n\nAny advice is very welcome. Busybee: Did you ever start using a nightguard? iamVilla: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid you ever start using a nightguard? No, I had to cancel the appointment I made and then didn’t get round to rebooking it. Am going to as a matter of urgency now though.

No, I asked the dentist about the buildup on the back of my teeth and she wasn’t concerned.\nI expected that to be the first thing she did.\n\nShould I be worried? Busybee: You might think about changing your dentist.  In the meantime book a hygiene appointment as a priority.   A good hygienist will take at least half an hour to clean your teeth and do a thorough check of your gums noting any areas of concern.

Busybee: If you do not feel it's helping then just use a regular fluoride paste until you see a new dentist.  The hygienist should show you how to floss and brush correctly.   Make sure you try this yourself before the end of the appointment.  If you don't feel you do a good job yourself then you should see a hygienist every two or three months.

Yes, the dentist thinks there's not enough tooth left underneath for a crown to hold to.  It is being held by the two beside it at the moment. Dr M: Do you have any x-rays you could share? jansumi: Oh, no, I don't.  Good idea to ask him for copies though. Although maybe I need new ones if things have changed.  i guess maybe that should be my first step, to double check, though he was pretty certain. What I'm trying to find out, though, is if he's right then what options do I have that don't involve any extraction Dr M: It depends on what he means if he says there is not enough tooth structure left. Was the tooth root canal treated? If so, the roots can be submerged, and then a bridge can be done over the submerged tooth.\nX-rays would help in giving more advice"

I have not had good oral hygiene recently and only started really paying attention to the gums about 3 weeks ago after about a year and a half since last dentist visit. The gingivitis in other sections of the mouth seemed to clear up very quickly but the dark red gums on one side seems to have gotten better but still very noticeable.\n\nWhen I went to the dentist this week he said my gums look fairly good despite a bit of gingivitis and when I asked about this area he said it is fine. He took an x-ray and said there was no bone loss and no gum disease. Is it possible that the dentist didn't see this as he only looked at the gums from behind the teeth not in front? I was thinking of waiting a few weeks and if the gums don't return to a pink colour going to another dentist, would this be the correct action to take? With good oral hygiene how long should I expect for this to go away?\n\nIt is hard to see in the image but it looks very noticeable in real life as there is basically a line between the two teeth with different gum colours. It was initially a very dark red but now it is looking more like a red/grey colour. MattKW: Not discernible on that photo. nesic123: Should I be checking at another dentist to see if there is a problem with the gums?

Dr M: Good day\n\nYou can call the dentist to have the bite adjusted on the temporary crown. If left like that, there is a chance that the temporary crown can break, leaving the underlying prepared area exposed.\nThis should not be a problem with the permanent crown, but make sure the crown is comfortable, before leaving the dental offices. MattKW: You should certainly get it reduced. A well-fitting temp crown should closely mimic the size and shape of the permanent crown. If the dentist adjusts the temp crown to fit your bite, and the temp crown becomes too thin, then it's likely the final crown will have a similar problem. If temp crown is too thin, then he should take more away from your natural tooth and take a new impression - no charge."

But thankfully no major pain in the TMJ joints.\n\nMy bite has also it seems been wrong all this time, my upper front teeth lined up directly on top of my lower front teeth. My right molars did the same, but the left upper molars come down inside the lower ones. I had difficulty chewing tough food like meat and therefore avoided it. All the pictures of people smiling in the dentists showed me what looked like my teeth in the mirror. So, I believed my teeth and bite were normal. Until I was 24 and my then future partner corrected me. However, for me biting and chewing food has always been difficult. But I managed by adjusting my diet. I managed through fillings, crowns and partial plates as none of them changed my bite.\n\nSince having all my upper teeth removed May 2019 and an upper denture made a year later, I have found.\n\nEating to be almost impossible. With or without the denture.\n\nThe new denture was loose, the dentist said use denture fixative and later the dentist re-lined it using a kit. But I find the denture to be still loose. I also find removing the fixative take about an hour and difficult.\n\nSecond eating, chewing and biting food is now extremely difficult. The new denture fits apparently as normal teeth should, the front upper teeth overlap the lower front teeth. I now cannot for example bite through even a slice of bread probably due to my different bite.\n\nI find I cannot sleep with the denture in but then find I cannot rest my jaw which leads to pain in my left side TMJ. I am thinking some sort of gum shield would help. But they all seem to be made to fit teeth. I need one that would fit my upper gums.\n\nMy dentist is now suggesting he fits me for another denture.

If the pulp (root canal) is diseased, then he/she will also recommend root canal treatment.   A filling may or may not be strong enough to support chewing functions on the molar especially if you grind and or clench your teeth."

It has never really given me any trouble until a couple of weeks ago, when I noticed the tooth throbbing occasionally, and the gum above the tooth (under my upper lip) was slightly sore when pressed. It was also slightly sore if I pressed just inside my nostril. It wasn't causing any problems eating though.\n\nI saw my dentist last Thursday who took an x-ray and said there was an infection behind the root and gave me some antibiotics. He said that the root filling was doing quite well to last 32yrs, as the average lifespan of a root filling was about 15yrs. He said that if the antibiotics don't work, the filling may need to be replaced (which he said is difficult and he'd refer me to a specialist), or that the tooth may need to come out.\n\nCan anyone advise me, If the antibiotics don't work, would it be best to try and save the tooth by having the filling replaced? Or would it be better to have the tooth removed, and some sort of implant?\n\nMy teeth are generally very good and don't give me any trouble. I have a couple of patches of erosion due to over brushing. The tooth with the root filling is one of them, and I was wondering whether that may be how I got the infection? \n\nIf the filling is replaced, I'm wondering how long it will last, and whether it is more likely to give problems? Also, what is likely to be the more longer lasting repair? MattKW: He means having the root filling replaced. Just how well that would work it impossible to tell on that info alone. Do you have any Xrays to show us, please? andy625: Thanks for the reply. I had x-ray taken, but my dentist has them so can't post them unfortunately. \n\nI've just finished  a course of antibiotics and things seem to have calmed down and the tooth isn't giving any discomfort at the moment, so I'm hoping that will last. \n\nIs it possible that I just aggravated the gum around the root of the tooth somehow, and that the discomfort was only temporary? MattKW: I couldn't say without the Xray. Nearly everyone has digital Xray machines nowadays, and they can be simply emailed as JPEGs or TIFFs. andy625: Thanks, that makes sense.

It might be that you have areas where the enamel is very thin and translucent and then it appears grey. This could cause them to feel sensitive. The brown might only be staining. It is best to see the dentist to evaluate if there are indeed cavities. Cavities are best prevented by good oral hygiene i.e brushing twice a day with fluoridated toothpaste and regular flossing.

Just recently I have purchased a sonic care tooth brush and a night gaurd. Just hoping I can hold out a while longer on the need for surgery as anything surgical gives me anxiety. Dr M: Good day\n\nI would wait before doing any periodontal surgery. Periodontal surgery doesn't always solve the problem. Your recession does not look too severe. I would change your habits first. Use a soft toothbrush, and use circular motions when brushing.  Go for regular dental check-ups to ensure good oral hygiene. If the recession becomes more severe, only then you can consider periodontal surgery EverE103: Thank you so much! I’ve recently purchased a sonic toothbrush and a night gaurd.

Some background: I'm 19, a non-cigarette smoker but I do vape (I know, I am attempting to quit), and frequent-ish drinker (rarely more than 2-3 5% beverages). I have been recently prescribed Adderall (20 mg 2-3 times a day) for my ADD/ADHD. However, since beginning treatment, I have to admit I have not been able to take care of myself properly (hygiene, eating, drinking water, etc). I have never been big on red meat or greens, so I have struggled with B12 and Iron deficiencies for a while now. Other than already having a poor diet, school work and my new prescription has dropped my weight from 135-125 over the span of 3-5 months. I noticed swelling/sores primarily on the sides/under my tongue and my inner cheeks (lower back molars) probably a month or so ago and went to the ER because I was worried sick. The doctor felt my lymph nodes and quickly glanced into my mouth and said my symptoms were most likely due to dehydration being recently malnourished. However, my tongue is beginning to hurt and I am still worried. Hoping she is right, and I just need to get my diet back on track. However, would really appreciate any insight you may be able to offer. Thank you! honestdoc: I don't see anything abnormal.  Get your diet, vaping and health in order ASAP.  You will get anxiety when your body deteriorates prematurely. katherine040601: Thank you for your reply! Definitely reassuring, and I will work on my diet and bad habits. Do you have any additional suggestions on how I should go about treating the white sores on the sides of my tongue? I'm prone to trauma canker sores from biting my lips, but never on my tongue They are a bit painful, but not always, and have been present for a little over a month now.

I think it's the tooth that was treated that is sensitive to hot and cold. My dentist made an x-ray and said everything would be fine, just the filling was a bit too high... And he told me that the tooth itself can't be sensitive as it's dead.\nI couldn't really believe him (sensitive to cold and hot because of a high filling!?)  but what else can I do as a patient.\nSo now there we are 1 month later, at least i can bite without suffering but I am still very sensitive to cold and hot and I think I should see him or an other dentist.\nI would be happy and thankful if you could tell me if my dentist seems good to you or if I should go see another one honestdoc: Did your dentist do a cold test?  He/she should test the surrounding teeth as well since many times it's the tooth next to the root canal that may be sensitive. MattKW: Any Xrays to show us (before and after RCT)?

    "title": "Question about cavity progression and x-rays",
    "dialogue": "bordor: My dentist said I have a few cavities he wants to fill. These are cavities he found when examining the surface of my teeth. I can't afford to get the fillings right now but he said that's ok, they don't need to be done right away, because they are small. At the same time, I know I should not let these cavities get too large before filling them. So I asked if on my next check up he could do an x-ray to see if they had grown larger. He then said they don't show up on the x-rays so he couldn't be sure what size they were. This left me feeling any future x-rays to monitor the growth of the cavities would be useless. But after I left the office and thought about what he said I felt confused. At first he said the cavities were small, then he said he couldn't be sure what size they are. Anyone have an idea why he might be saying that? Also, why do some cavities show up on x-rays and others not show up? What is it that makes a cavity visible on an x-ray? I'm guessing that once a cavity is large enough, it is visible on an x-ray? Or is that not the case?\n\nIs there any way to monitor the growth of a cavity over time, so at least I would know if the cavity had really enlarged and a filling was urgent? Any recommendations for a way I could work with my dentist to do this?\n\nThank you for your help. MattKW: If he saw it on your surfaces, then I'm assuming this was in the biting (occlusal) fissures of your teeth. Taking Xrays of early occlusal decay will only show it up ~60% of the time; by the time you can reliably see occlusal decay on an Xray, it's moderately large. Xrays are more useful for early decay between adjacent teeth (interproximal decay).\n Did he suggest any less invasive treatment, e.g. fluoride applications, fissure sealants, PRRs? \nBased on your story, I think I'd wait and monitor. bordor: Hi Matt,\n\nThanks for replying. The feedback you've given me is helpful and I appreciate it.\n\nHere is what I know about the cavities: one is occlusal, as you said. the second is on the front of one of my front teeth. I do not know specifically where it is.He just pointed at the tooth surface in a general way without pinpointing a spot. I cannot see anything there with the naked eye. The third is between two of my upper teeth, on the upper inside edge of the tooth. This is the one  he said the most about because on my visit the day before he probed that area with the explorer and said it was sticky. He also said the decay had penetrated the enamel. also I had noticed some darker discoloration in that area myself awhile back, but I did not think much of it because I have had some tooth discoloration in that general area for a long time.  I do not have pain in that area, or sensitivity to hot or cold drinks.\n\nSo one is occlusal but the other two are not - is there a reason they still wouldn't show up on the x-rays?  maybe they are still too small? If I understand what you said it sounds like those would be more likely to show up on x-rays.\n\nHow  do you determine that decay has completely penetrated the enamel and reached the dentin? X-ray visibility isn't needed to do that?\n\nTo answer your other questions, he did not propose any other treatments. He said I had three cavities that needed to be filled and should make an appointment for that. Since I can't afford to do that right now, that is when I began to ask him more questions about the size and location of all the cavities and if they could simply be watched to see if they enlarged.\n\nMaybe on my next check up I should seek another opinion. I'm wondering with current technologies, would I be able to request having my x-rays emailed to me or something like that? Maybe it would be valuable to have them on hand."

    "title": "Pain a month after root canal",
    "dialogue": "shouldabeenflossing: I honestly kind of regret mentioning to a dentist that I USED to have sensitivity in one of my back molars. He said well in order to drill anymore off those teeth, we will have to remove the outside and crown them. I should have questioned this more.\n\nOnce the impressions were made, drilling done, temp crowns placed - off I went home. Took an ibuprofen just because I knew I'd be a little sensitive. Nope, I had no idea how sensitive I'd be. After a week of level 7 pain, waking up in the middle of the night when the painkillers wore off, having to go get a snack and take more, I finally was able to get into the endodontist.\n\nThis freaking dental office is only open 3 days a week and the endodontist was on vacation. He does an endo ice test and leaves it on the tooth for much too long - I have a high pain tolerance and I ended up hearing my own moans of pain and instantly start crying. Never had that happen before. The pain doesn't end. It just keeps going.\n\nOkay, yes, definitely needed a root canal in that tooth. He drills right through the temp crown, does the root canal, tries to convince me beforehand that I'm nervous about it after asking me if I was and me saying no. This was my third RCT so no I wasn't actually nervous but OK, weird thing to do. Then he leaves and assistant takes an x-ray.\n\nAssistant says there's a void in one of the roots, he will probably have to fix it. Also there seems to be some gapping between the top of the root fill and the fill he puts on top of those stick things. I'm not an endodontist but it looked different than my other RC'd teeth on x-ray. \n\nAfter that, it's been a month and I've had flare up pain ever since. One of the crowns didn't fit so I have a second temp (presumably didn't fit because of RCT which makes total sense). My TMJ on that side has gotten so much worse, probably because the temp is sitting way too high, even after I came back to have to corrected. Still another few weeks till I get my permanent crown, assuming this one even fits.\n\nI am used to regular pain, especially morning and night, just from having a jaw joint disorder. It gives me headaches and facial pain but I've learned to live with it to a certain extent. This is just another level of existing with head/teeth/face pain and I think the thing that's ticking me off is I feel like I could have avoided it by going to a better dentist. Instead I went to a chain dental company with \"affordable\" in the name, and I learned a really shitty lesson. I'm trying to look on the bright side and not think about how my TMJ is now worse, my RC'd tooth is still pressure sensitive, I've had a swollen lymph node on that side of my neck for over a month, my energy levels have dropped, I'm out 3.5k and counting, and I'm getting legitimately depressed to the point where I'm really not working or eating enough, can't get out of bed, just super over it. \n\nJust looking for advice, anything to make me feel better about the choice I made with going to this dentist. Wondering if my root canal sounds like it was failed, if I have to pay for it since the x-ray didn't look right, and if TMJ will forever be worse? Also, might not have mentioned this, but pain gets worse when laying down. I'm guessing blood in head increases pressure to teeth but I'm not sure. MattKW: Can't say much about the RCT unless you can put up copies of the Xrays. However, if tooth and general area is not settled, then DON'T have the permanent crown cemented. If they can't get your post-RCT pain and TMJ pain settled while the temp crown is there, then they're unlikely to help you once the permanent crown is cemented. shouldabeenflossing: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCan't say much about the RCT unless you can put up copies of the Xrays.

Paediatric dentist saw her and said tooth was alive and to leave be and has been well with no pain or swelling. \nFor the past 24 hours she has had toothache worse with pressure/eating but no analgesia required. Dentist review and xray showing some lucency around the primary tooth root that is new compared to 6m ago.\nDentist advises extraction and that can safely wait for this but appt is >6 weeks away. \nThis seems a long time to leave infection grumbling. Am I right to be concerned? I worry the infection may progress/become a large abscess or track to surrounding structures. Also could it cause damage to the adjacent and unerupted permanent tooth if left that long?\nAny advice would be much appreciated. Dr M: Good day\n\nUsually the dentist would have prescribed antibiotics to control the spread of the infection. If you are worried, phone around and see if you can get an appointment earlier somewhere else. MattKW: Kids often whack their front teeth like this in the toddler stage (2-3 years old). The greyness indicates death of the pulp (\"nerve\"), but because no germs got in, the body tolerates it quite well and extraction is often not needed. However, moving on to 5-6 years old, and the adult teeth have moved down and eaten away some of the baby tooth root. This allows more of the dead nerve to interact with the body, and a full defense starts up; an extraction is required, often followed soon afterwards by the adult tooth coming through a bit early. The adult tooth will be undamaged. \nAlso, these situations are sometimes a bit tender, but the pus may burst through the thin bone in a child (a gumboil), and the pain is relieved. It is rare in children for an abscess of a front tooth to develop into a nasty situation. Antibiotics are a last resort IF: it swells up significantly, she starts getting more serious pain, and you can't get into a dentist. Taking them now when the appt is 6 weeks away will achieve nothing."

I'd be wondering if you'd had some trauma (a sporting blow, perhaps?) at an earlier age, and that there is either a calcified or dead pulp (\"nerve\"). Yes, we'd need to see an Xray. However, despite COVID, there's nothing you can do for it yourself, and if it's been like this for a while, then it's unlikely to get worse soon.

Whilst I do not regret this as it was bulging out my mouth at the time I am now being told that to get braces and make everything align I will need to get the lateral incisor on the right side of the top removed as well.\n\nAs well as this due to a cluster at the bottom i have been told the recommendation is that two are removed at the bottom in addition to the one on the top leaving the total teeth removed to three. This feels like a lot of teeth to me and any negatives/positives/potential issues in the future that anybody could point my way would help me make my decision a lot easier. Dr M: Good day\n\nUsually extractions are recommended when there is a severe space shortage in the maxilla or the mandible. For them to suggest removal of your upper lateral incisor as well as other extractions, it might indicate that you have such a shortage, but it is impossible to give an opinion without an xray or photos. Usually there is a comprehensive treatment plan drawn up by your orthodontist. This might include post ortho treatments, such as bridges, implants or even shaping your canines in order to camouflage them as laterals.\nIf you have any concerns, bring this up with your orthodontist, so that the rationale behind the proposed treatments can be explained to you in full. As well as what the plan will be after the ortho is finished. \nIt is quite common for extractions to take place prior to ortho treatment, depending on the severity of the case. wobblym: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tGood day\n\nUsually extractions are recommended when there is a severe space shortage in the maxilla or the mandible.

Thanks for the response, however I have two follow up question for you.\n\nWhat has currently been communicated to me is that the bottom is almost necessary due to the crowding on the lowering area. This is something I have accepted and believe that aesthetically will be fine once they have all been straightened out.\nHowever, my only concern is the upper right lateral incisor removal as you have already gathered. I have been told that this is obviously my choice as to whether or not I wish for the central incisors to be aligned with the middle of my mouth. This is due those two teeth having shifted left after the removal of the left lateral incisor. Would this look odd aesthetically? And my final worry which might be nothing would be would this affect my jaw/bite removing this many teeth? If required I would happy to provide pictures on this forum which give you more detail.\n\nThanks Dr M: Usually the treatment plan can have an ideal outcome or a compromised outcome. If the orthodontist suggested removing the lateral in order to adjust the midline, it is most likely to give you the best aesthetic outcome. If you want to rather leave the lateral in situ, you will have to accept the fact that the orthodontist will try and camouflage it, but you will never have that 100% aesthetic outcome.\nSome orthodontists utilize digital platforms to show you more or less what the end result will look like. You can maybe ask about that.\nWith regards to your bite--usually at the end of orthodontic treatment, the aim will be to leave your teeth in the most harmonious occlusal relationship."

I decided to register my wife, who had got a fear of dentists but also had been so busy with work she had not had a check-up for over 2 years, but she agreed to go as she needed to get her mouth checked. With great trepidation she went in to see a very nice and competent dentist who managed to put my wife at ease and indeed start dealing with any issues. One was a gap in her teeth which she was somewhat self conscious of when smiling. He built a small plate and transformed her smile.\nThis dentist left the practice soon after for another one out of town quite some distance away and went private. So pleased was my wife we followed and took out a recommended DENPLAN account which was set at £90 per month for the two of us, something we have paid ever since. Our dentist was starting to specialise in implantology, and his partner at the new practice ( full of the latest technology ) also specialised in this. Firstly we had a full dental review ( My teeth and my wives were in quite a good condition overall, however, I had one problem with a tooth and was advised to have an Onlay procedure.).\nThis was about £400 if I recall, extra to the Denplan. My wife's gap, served by the plate, was reviewed and an implant was recommended, and I also had a gap and the same was recommended to me( I had had this gap years, since a teenager). My wife's implant was priced at some £4000, mine at £2,700 appox. We agreed and went ahead. No issues the implants were done with no problems. \nA month or two later one of my wife's molars was according to the dentist 'needing treatment' ( She had another small gap at the rear right, and it was suggested she have the tooth ( and I am sure this was correct ) root-canaled (it's really a dead tooth), and use it as an anchor for a bridge over the gap to improve the biting surface and save the tooth. This cost approx £2000.\nOur dentist moved again, and we followed him recently. So our new dental review at the practice. Well, I am Ok generally apart from some mild gum problem covered by Denplan, but he was not happy with my wifes bridge which he says will probably 'fail'. He has outlined yet another treatment plan to replace this molar tooth and get rid of the bridge and replace it with an implant which he has costed at approx £6500.\nNow, we are not idiots, we know private dental care costs, and we are fortunate that we could afford this. However since taking out our Denplan ( no reduction to fees during lockdown by the way ) we have spent already in the region of some £10,000. before calculating all the Denplan fees. He now wants another £6500..To be fair my wife was shocked and quite unhappy. Let me make it clear, we have no concerns about the competence of the dentist ( although we are very unhappy at the bridge failure from the other practice )...we are thinking though, when will this end, as I am sure that there will always be something to be done. my cynical side sees it as seeing patients a cash cows...\nAt 66 and 67 we have worked hard for our money, and we both feel that while we know it's not cheap, it does seem somewhat of an extortionate merry go round. We are on the point of leaving the practice and going back to NHS care. We don't neglect our teeth and keep all our appointments, but the costs are getting prohibitive....I would appreciate views, and thank you for taking the time to read this. honestdoc: I'm from the US and I can understand the burdens of dentistry costs.

    "dialogue": "rosieloljmj: So a few days ago I started getting pain in the back of my mouth. Didn’t think much of it because I get canker sores sometimes and I figured it could be that. I looked in my mouth and it’s basically red and tender and maybe a bit inflamed above my left molar(wisdom tooth).\n\n It’s gotten worse and now it hurts ok my left side to chew and my neck/throat hurts and I can barely open my mouth because it hurts a lot. The teeth feel fine except it’s a tiny bit tender if I press on the left bottom wisdom tooth. I didn’t think it could be pericoronitis because my wisdom teeth came in years prior with no issues and the dentist never told me to get them removed(my sister had to get hers removed when they came in). I’ve also never had this happen before. It’s making me nervous and I was really just expecting it to go away like a canker sore in some days but right now it’s just painful constantly and it’s making hard to even sleep. I feel like it might be getting better and that the pain is subsiding a bit and don't know it if is necessary to see a dentist as potentially I guess the infection can spread and become dangerous? I called my dentists office but the earliest appointment I could get was like a little over a week away. I've heard the most common treatment is to clean out the area and sometimes to take antibiotics and possibly get the wisdom teeth removed. I can clean it out somewhat on my own, but I don't know if I should get on antibiotics sooner rather than later to be safe? Dr M: Good day\n\nIf the pain is getting better, no need for antibiotics.\nIt might be a good idea to get a anti-septic mouthwash to use. Or rinse with some luke-warm salt water, at least 4 times a day.\nGo and see your dentist thereafter, and have him evaluate your wisdom teeth for possible removal. MattKW: As per Dr M. I rarely see people who will manage to fit their wisdoms in so well that there will be no problems later in life. \nBasic rules:\n\nIf they only come part of the way through, even if no pain, then have them removed.\nIf they give any trouble at all (e.g. pericoronitis), get them out.\nIf they don't function well, i.e. bite well with opposing wisdom teeth, get them out.\nI really see very few people who I think will get through the rest of their lives without problems. I have no love lost for wisdom teeth!"

A hard bump is usually the bone - this may or may not be associated with an abscess. If it is abscess-related, then it will slowly shrink over about 6-12 months following a successful RCT.

    "dialogue": "Vandy: I had a horrible experience  with the RCT of upper left 6 and 7 which lasted for the last 1.5 years, which could never get resolved even after multiple re-RCTs and, due to covid lockdown in march 2020, remained incomplete and had opened up after a few months. I could not chew on that side for 1.5 years (ever since the RCT started in oct 2019), and I was fed up of chewing from my right side only. By now, caries had also developed much beyond the gum line in both the teeth. I tried to get it completed again 2 months back but had such a bad systemic reaction after the treatment and became so severely ill that I could not step out of the house to go through so many visits again. Meanwhile, covid cases started suddenly rising rapidly again and lockdown could start again anytime soon. The dentist may be closing and this time, it may be for longer. Due to these factors,  I asked the dentist whether it would be better if he could just extract the teeth as I would not be able to bear another prolonged period like this as I could not eat from that side at all n it was always inflamed even after multiple RCT attempts.  He took the attached  xray and extracted upper left 6 and 7. Due to the current covid situation and being totally fed up for so long, I had to go through this unwanted n horrifying decision of losing my precious molars, which used to be absolutely solid 1.5 years ago, but I lost them due to the turn of events which were not in my hands. (Moreover, neither of the teeth was fractured and they came out in one solid piece. It seemed all the tips came out intact.) This happened 3 weeks ago.  However, now even after 3 weeks, there is still pain/swelling on the spot above where upper left 6 was (where I have pointed with my finger in the attached pic). This corresponds to the area behind my cheek which is about 1 inch left of my left nostril. There seems to be some slight nodule there which I can feel on top of my cheek with my finger, and that part of my cheek is slightly swollen inside  (not visible on outside). It's the same problem I had when the tooth was there...when I tried to chew, that same spot would get inflamed and painful. I thought that extracting the tooth would solve the problem, but it's still there. This problem only started after the first RCT started. What could this be?  Could there be a cyst or some other problem in that spot?  Will this pain ever stop or some other further treatment is needed? I am already feeling devastated about losing my teeth, and now am horrified that the problem is still there. Please let me know possible reasons for the problem and their solution. MattKW: The \"nodule\" is just the bone left after the extraction. Over several months it will usually smooth itself out, this will not be associated with any pain, although the wound site is still in early stages so would be a bit tender to chew on. Without Xrays (before and after) and a more detailed history, it's not possible to make much comment on your perceived pain. I doubt that there is anything sinister going on."

You can consider composite filling material build ups, or veneers as well. Bruxism cases can sometimes be very difficult to rehabilitate.

I was starting to get weird feelings from the dentists I've seen - like they weren't being completely straight with me. They kept steering the conversation towards the aesthetics of the repair, when I am worried about preserving the health of my teeth. I basically don't want to wear them down until there is nothing left. MattKW: 1. OK, that resolves why you are wearing them down , and I can only strongly advise that you change your diet completely ASAP or you will keep having problems. Maybe you would benefit from the support of a dietician. Some dental schools have them on staff too.\n2. Oh, so the Invisalign has left them unable to touch with the lower teeth? That's bizarre and short-sighted; it's not a good way to handle this problem. If you went to a prosthodontist I would expect them to be similarly aghast at the treatment you are receiving. Some people think we shouldn't criticise our colleagues, and sometimes that can be true because I don't have your full history etc, but I hate to see laypeople given limited and harmful options.\n3. Composite rehab would aim at restoring the lost tooth structure on ALL your teeth (front and back) in the most conservative fashion. Crowning your teeth is an aggressive treatment. Sure, you might add a bit of length, but you have to grind off the front and sides of your teeth. Comp rehab is done simply adding to the length with MINIMAL tooth damage and minimal risk. Crowning is non-reversible; comp rehab is mostly reversible.\n4.  Question: How can you bite through food if your front teeth don't meet?\nAnswers: Either (a) you still are biting with your front teeth by sliding your jaw into an accommodating position, or (b) your front teeth are slowly growing back into contact again (the Dahl Concept), or (c) you are now eating more on your back teeth so they will start to wear down instead. All of theee possibilities are bad for you.\n5.  There's a saying, \"Give a carpenter a hammer and he'll want to hit a nail.\" This narrow thinking  also applies in medicine and dentistry for many people. Partly due to our limited training. One only gets to think outside the box by going to lots of seminars, getting lots of experience, and (sadly) working in this game long enough to see what happens to long-term health of our patients when we offer poor choices.\nCase-in-point: 2 days ago I was teaching in the student clinics and a patient like you came in. The student could only think in terms of what their limited knowledge told them, so I sat down with student and patient and gave them nearly the same  long talk I'm giving you. I wasn't taught any better in my training, but I'm not going to let the next generation of dentists make the same mistakes I made. It may not be that the dentists you are seeing are just looking to do a quick fix at your expense; it is more likely that they simply don't know any better."

Could someone please tell me how this could be fixed. Thank you honestdoc: If you must close the gap (diastema), the least invasive/expensive would be to place bonding between them.  More expensive options include veneers if your existing front teeth are solid or clear liners/braces to move teeth (which takes time).  If it were my teeth, I would leave it alone since I don't like any of those options (I don't want any drilling, bondings  & veneers coming off or trauma to my teeth and I'm less vain). MattKW: Bonding is the easiest and most reversible. However, sometimes filling in a gap makes your front teeth look too wide. I like to do a 5-minute mock-up for people sometimes and they'll understand it better. For more complicated cases, either a proper wax mock-up, or a Photoshp mockup works well."

    "dialogue": "mushroombrew: A few weeks ago, the area around my rear,right,bottom molar started to get tender.  I scheduled a new-patient dentist appt.  (I haven't been in a few years) The appt was 6 weeks out.  3.5 weeks remaining.  Well, the other day, I developed a sore on my gum in the tender area.  A couple of tiny bone fragments worked their way out and it looks like it's healing some now.  It's still tender though.  The same spot on the left side started to get tender and another sore just like the one on the right popped up.  This one has gotten bigger, and there is either a large bone fragment in there or a tooth.  The \"bone/tooth) isn't painful in and of itself, and it appears to be anchored in there very well.  The gum around it is extremely tender though, and that back molar is not happy.  The problem areas are at to just behind my back molars, and only on the bottom.  I've never had my wisdom teeth out but I'm a 40-years old.  No clue it it's that or something else though.  Should I just wait until my appt or should I call an oral surgeon?  I have zero experience with major dental issues, so I'm at a loss as to how to proceed.  It's starting to get nigh on unpleasant now though.\n\nMany Thanks honestdoc: We don't know what's going on underneath without x-rays.  We can only guess and it looks very much like bony sequestra where the bone fragments were starved of blood supply and became necrotic and exfoliating. mushroombrew: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWe don't know what's going on underneath without x-rays.

    "dialogue": "Vandy: Due to the pandemic, my root canal had remained open for nearly a  year (only a cotton ball was covering the opening). When I went back to the dentist, he said the canals would need to be disinfected and clearly said he was filling the root canals with silver diamine fluoride. However, the next day, suddenly I had extreme pain in that tooth (second molar... upper left 7), severe internal vibrations/tremors inside my whole body and extreme weakness in my body and legs. I never had any health problems before, and I have never in my life had such horrifying severe systemic reactions which are present even today after a month. When the xray was taken again (see second molar on xray called white area) there was a white spot/area just above the root of upper left 7. No such spot/white area was visible in previous xrays (see xray 3). My question is, \n1. did the SDF leak outside the tooth, destroy the nerve, and then get absorbed into the bone\n2. even if that white area is not SDF, but still, was the SDF the cause of my severe reaction, as the SDF must have come into direct contact with the nerve and caused damage or toxic poisoning?\n3. i still have severe debility and severe internal tremors/vibrations after a month.  will they ever go away or is the damage permanent? what can be done to undo the damage to my health?\n4. if that white area is the leaked SDF, will it remain there, have to be removed, or disperse on its own? MattKW: Never heard of SDF used during an RCT. Even if it was used and leaked into the bone (extremely unlikely), it wouldn't show up on Xrays, nor does it \"destroy the nerve\". The white patch looks like bone.\nYou'd have to pump a helluva lot of SDF through an open apex to cause a reaction, and even then it would probably be just localised. Poisoning and causing distant symptoms doesn't happen. There is no big nerve bundle in that area; more like a spider's web.\nYou should go see a general doctor for the symptoms. It is likely to be just a coincidence that you feel this way after the tooth was treated.\nAnd that's a poor RCT that should be redone. A poor RCT like that will cause discomfort only in the area around the tooth, not far away."

( eruption out of the normal arch).\nIf these are normal permanent teeth, it might be a good idea to undergo an orthodontic evaluation, to see if these teeth can be moved back into the arch with braces, or if they can be extracted and then the remaining teeth only moved to close any potential gaps.\nIf they are indeed supernumaries, they can be extracted, especially if they are going to compromise the remaining teeth and/or tissues surrounding the teeth.\nBest to get an opinion from your usual dentist or orthodontist."

    "dialogue": "kylie: So my mom has been experiencing a lot of teeth ace, not so much that she needs to go to the ER but she's unable to move her entire mouth while talking. She has never really taken care of her teeth in the past as she was brought up by careless parents herself so she never really learned true mouth hygiene. She doesn't really talk about her teeth because she knows they're not good-looking or healthy but I think she's now realized that if she doesn't take action, her teeth will fall out. I've noticed that her mouth has a foul smell which has gotten worse over the years but every time she talks about it, she says her teeth and gums hurt too much that she can't even brush her teeth. I've taken a pic of her teeth to show a doctor, and since I can't upload it, I will describe it. So, her gums are kind of swollen, she's got whitish grayish build-up stuff around the bottoms of her teeth and around the top teeth. Her two front teeth seem to be coming out and the rest top seems to be separating and coming out of the gums. Her bottom teeth are really crooked and really dirty and again, there's some build-up whitish grayish stuff that I don't know what to call. She says she feels as though if the doctor even touches her teeth, they will fall out. What treatment do I have to get her to get healthy teeth, even if they're new ones. I can't go to the dentist yet because of COVID so I'm asking here. Oh and she says the backs of her teeth hurt a lot I guess wisdom teeth? , which combined with the severe headaches, makes it so she can hardly open her mouth when she speaks. honestdoc: I'm suspecting your mother has severe periodontitis.  Nobody will know how severe unless she gets x-rays to check bone levels and a clinical exam.  If the teeth are loose, I suspect she will need dentures. kylie: if her stage is really bad, will there be more problems additional to what she already has? honestdoc: If she has chronic mouth infections due to bad teeth and gums, it could compromise her health.  A lot of new studies show bad mouth can hurt her heart and circulation.  Unfortunately if she needs dentures, her ability to chew food will greatly diminish as well as  loose and severely deteriorating teeth. kylie: So she went to the ER, and did CT scans and did some blood and urine tests and they all turned out normal because the doctor over the phone thought she might’ve had a stroke since she couldn’t really talk and move her bottom jaw after one night of bad headache. All the tests came back normal, but besides her bad mouth situation, she feels weakness in the jaw and muscles around her mouth: she says she feels like pull between then when she’s trying to talk so she has to keep her mouth closed and teeth and muscles together so she talk comfortably. Basically she feels weakness and pull around her teeth and surrounding muscles. We can’t rlly go to a walk in dentist clinic because of COVID and we’ve made some appointments that r weeks away. What could the problem be? And can it be resolved with medication or physiotherapy? MattKW: It sounds like it is all related to the teeth. If people start getting pain when eating (toothaches, gum disease, ...) then their muscles reflexively start to \"seize up\"; there's not much that medicines can do UNLESS she gets treatment to relieve the pain (and physio isn't an option). Once she starts getting her problems properly treated, this tightness will gradually resolve. If she keeps waiting, then she will be unable to open at all. Not only does this put her at riosk of choking, but it's going to make it harder for the dentist. You must get her to go soon and get a proper examination and treatment plan. No-one's going to be pulling out teeth at the first appointment, and she can always go somewhere else for 2nd or 3rd opinions. It sounds like she'd benefit from having you go along to support her."

It will help lubricate your mouth and prevent cavities (neutralize acid damage)\n2)  The crowns are not your natural teeth with natural contours.  They are altered slightly and sometimes can cause some food debris to be trapped.  Did you talk to your dentist about this?  Excessive debris being trapped is not optimal. \n3)  Any drilling on teeth will make them more temperature sensitive.  The more drilling, the more trauma it can cause which can injure the nerve in the root canal.  Try not to overwhelm your teeth with temperature (your teeth will remind you) and allow the nerves to calm itself. MattKW: Drooling most likely caused by unusual feeling of extra bulk of teeth. It should settle in time as your brain adjusts to the new sensation. Try not to obsess over it.\nTalk to dentist, or get 2nd opinion. Too hard to comment here, but food impaction should NOT be happening. It may also contribute to drooling.\nDental treatment is never risk-free. Crowning teeth can cause nerve (pulpal) death in 5-15% of cases. Therefore, crowning teeth is not to be undertaken lightly - it's not as simple as changing the tires on your car. Again, consider 2nd opinion."

    "title": "Tooth Erosion Is Ruining My Speech",
    "dialogue": "DentalHelpRequired: Hi, everyone. \n\nIt's been a rough year and I think I just need to toss this out into the void to see what happens.\n\nI have a bottom tooth that protrudes outward significantly and it - along with acidic drinks and poor hygiene - scraped away the back of one of my front teeth and has left me with an infuriating speech impediment. I have a degree in English, have traditionally spoken with great fluidity, and typically consider myself to be an above average orator. Essentially, speaking eloquently has always been something that I've taken great pride in - until now.\n\nMy front tooth has lost so much volume that my tongue no longer makes contact with it when speaking quickly. L, R, T, S, CH, and SH sounds - ESPECIALLY if they're back-to-back - have become incredibly awkward for me to pronounce. For example, if I say the word \"texts\" then it comes out as a half-assed sounding \"texs\" without the final 't' and a whistling 's' hanging on the end of it. It's as if I only have single front tooth despite the fact that they look completely normal when I smile. From behind, the tooth feels concaved - inordinately curved and significantly different than it ever has before.\n\nThe slightly disjointed alignment of my two front teeth has also opened a sliver of space that is resulting in an absolutely infuriating whistle when pronouncing 's' words. It's very subtle and is only noticeable when I whisper or speak softly, - it gets lost in the loudness of my voice otherwise - but it drives me crazy.\n\nBasically, I'm incapable of speaking mindlessly anymore. There is no such thing as cruise control. I'm forced to focus intently on pronouncing everything properly instead of whatever thought I'm attempting to convey. This has completely fucked up my flow as a speaker, a writer, and - at times - even as a thinker. It's killing me silently and other people don't notice it because it's not particularly glaring. It just feels terrible - like having a rock in your shoe that gets increasingly painful over time.\n\nAnyway, I feel like I'm going crazy. It's killing me. I think about it every time that I open my mouth to speak. I repeat every sentence under my breath like a crazy person to try and find that comfort zone that I once lived in - but I never do. It's gone. My dentist recommended braces so I'm going to drop $6k on that in hopes of remedying this issue for good. I don't see how braces can replace the volume that my tooth has clearly lost, but I've run out of alternative options. Hopefully this works. Otherwise, I fear that I'll never reacquire my ability to speak and write with the force that I once possessed.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this? If so, what did you do? Are braces truly the solution? Dr M: Good day\nIt sounds to me that braces might be a good option. Correct arch alignment will minimize damage to teeth due to traumatic occlusion. It can also greatly improve speech function, depending on what other problems are also present.  As to the volume of the affected tooth--depending on how the tooth looks like now, the tooth can maybe receive a crown after the ortho has been completed. This will give it more volume.\nIt will be a good idea to discuss your worries with the orthodontist, prior to starting the treatment, so that he can give you some advice on what the plan will be after the orthodontic phase has been completed. MattKW: I wouldn't suggest braces at all based on what you have said. It would be better to:\n\nIdentify and remove the causes of erosion - usually an acidic diet\nRebuild the lost tooth structure (rehabilitation):\nA good general dentist might do this with composite, or go for a consultation with a prosthodontist.\nIf that goes well over time, then you might change the composite for porcelain.\n\nWith an ageing population who are keeping most of their teeth, this is an area of treatment which is becoming very common. I've had great success with just composite alone, and the manufacturers are bringing out new materials which are ideal for the job."

It seemed that the crown and the abutmant seemed\njust fine, but I don't believe they are supposed to be attached together; I think the abutment should still be in the implant.

My husband said the screw, screwed in a little, but he was afraid to do anything further for fear of damaging what can off.\n\n\nKaren yentakaren: Went back to the original dentist who said he didn't do that implant (maybe it was the endodontist that did the implant).  \nAnyway, the original dentist that we had (a great dentist) fixed my husband's implant by drilling into the crown and screwing\nthe implant in (he needed a special screwdriver to get it completely (100%) in - almost 100% but not. But it worked and he charged my husband $250.00.  Which we thought was fair.  He said if we can find the dentist that originally did the implant and find out the name\nof the screwdriver, he would be able to screw it in 100%.

So I had to juggle getting the new crown and getting rescanned.    \n\nMy wife has a few crowns and tells me that she can't tell the difference.\nMy dentist did the thing where you bite down on some carbon paper and shaved the crown down.  The thing is, I wonder if that was the right thing to do.  Yeah, my teeth touch in weird places, but I'm in the middle of an Invisalign treatment.  I think she shaved too much of the anatomy of the crown.  It doesn't feel like a tooth anymore.  It feels like a gum drop or like I have wax stuck on the inside of my tooth.  The way she shaved it, I'm afraid I may need a whole new crown.  Honestly, I want to just tell her to remove it and try again.  I'm sure she'd be hesitant to agree.   I already questioned her to the point where she seemed a little annoyed.  When she said my tooth was cracked, I questioned why my last Dentist didn't notice.  When I she showed me a pic, I just said it looks like silver filling to me.   I'm sure they're going to try to shave more off in the middle of the tooth or something to make it feel better, but I don't think that'll work. \n\nI started looking online about crown removal.  I read some sites that say removal can damage the tooth, especially with newer forms of cement.  I also read they can cut it and pry it off with minimal risk.   \n\nHas anybody gone through this?  I don't know how to approach this with my dentist.  What if she tries to take the crown off without cutting it.  Should I refuse because it may damage the tooth?  I've been feeling very anxious about the whole ordeal.  I don't know how the appointment is going to go.  I don't know how high my expectations should be on the crown feeling like a real tooth.  I don't know what I'm talking about when I'm sitting in the chair.  I don't know if she's a good dentist or a bad one.  On one hand, I'm afraid they can't do anything, on the other hand, I'm afraid they'll do too much and things will be worse. honestdoc: A system called Metalift Crown and Bridge Remover System may be an option.  It may not work well for all ceramic and Zirconia crowns.  Usually to remove the crown, we must destroy the existing crown by sectioning the crown and pry it loose.  In doing so, the tooth underneath can get some surface damage.  It's hard for me to give you my assessment.  It's not the best scenario when you don't totally trust your dentist."

As long as the filling is well-sealed and has no decay, allow the teeth to heal and avoid anything too cold (not overwhelm it with cold fluids, ice cream, etc.).  If you can't stand the pain, you may need to consider root canal or implant.  The swallowing difficulty may be independent (not related) to the fillings.

Three attempts have been made by the laboratory to correct the color.  A new crown was made which also did not match.  The last time this laboratory made a crown for me was 3 years ago and it was perfect. \n\nWhen 3 attempts failed to correct the color my dentist said that she and I would visit the laboratory to get a good color match.  When the specified day came to visit the dental laboratory, I did not hear from the dentist. She backed out and has made no attempt to let me know what her plan is to complete my in progress dental work. Before this work on my tooth started, I offered to visit the dental laboratory by myself, so all these problems with getting the right crown color would be avoided.  \n\nThis is my question.  Am I obligated to accept this imperfect crown?  Can I be firm on getting the right color?  How should this situation be handled?  Can I go to another dentist and hope for better results?  I have Delta Dental insurance and I have paid $561.00 out of pocket.\n\nI would like to hear about your experiences in a similar situation.  I would be grateful for your opinions and advice.\n\nKathy S. honestdoc: I don't like porcelain fused to metal.  As the porcelain bonds to metal, there are opaque layers that will never match.   Too often I see porcelain separate or fracture off the metal.   I like all-ceramic crowns like zirconia for back molars and E-Max for anteriors.  I'm surprised that your \"cosmetic\" dentist still uses PFMs.  You should not accept crowns that you don't like."

    "dialogue": "unknownxuser: Two weeks ago I started to have sudden severe pains in my top right molar.  At first, it was only when I ate but quickly progressed to sporadic unprovoked pain. \nThe pain escalated to a sharp severe pulsing pain that would sometimes last over an hour. The pain seemed to be from the tooth to the gum, with no noticeable irritation to my jaw/muscle. (Due to the pandemic and financial changes I had to change my primary dentist and also had been a year overdue for an appointment).\n\nThe first dentist: took X-rays said he couldn't see anything visibly wrong with the tooth and suggested I try a mouth guard because it is possible I may be grinding or clenching.  Immediately went out and bought two. \n\nAbout a day or two later pain had become more severe, I couldn't eat or drink anything at all. Sought out the second dentist for a second opinion.\n\nSecond Dentist: Again took x-rays, didn't see anything wrong. But decided to take a closer look himself and found my gums to be inflamed as well as a small pocket of bacteria around one tooth that he cleaned out.  He suggested a cleaning which I had done that day and prescribed an antiseptic mouth wash (which I already had).\n\nThough I left feeling ok, later on, that day while trying to eat dinner, extreme pains came back. This time it seemed to be upper and lower molars in that same area. \n\nI made an urgent care visit: to seek out antibiotics in case of an infection or abscess. Dr was obviously highly confused and (as expected) not experienced with teeth. But I got antibiotics and started to take them as a precaution. \n\nI also made an endodontist appointment (out-of-pocket costs) to rule out the possibility of a root canal and also just another opinion. The endodontist was just as confused as the others, saying my teeth weren't responding negatively to all of the tests, and that they appeared to be healthy for now. So she was unsure of what could be causing the pain. She did mention maybe needing to see a periodontist or a neurologist but quickly dropped the idea. Her treatment option for the issue was muscle relaxers for two weeks with the mouthguard to rule out clenching and if that doesn't subside then to make an oral surgeon appointment. \n\nTwo days later Desperate and still in pain, I decided to just pay out of pocket and go back to my previous primary dentist in hopes that maybe he could figure something out.  More X-rays and tests, he didn't seem convinced that TMJ- a mouth guard - or a neurologist would be necessary. But he was just as confused as everyone else I had seen. He did say he saw a slight shadow under the filling of the original problem tooth. So he cleaned out the tooth and redid the filling. I had some pain relief for about 24 hours then the pain localized back to that lower molar same side. The one tooth, that now turned into two sore teeth all have old fillings in them from years ago, so I started to wonder if that was part of the problem. So I went back to the dentist and he did the same thing to the filling on that tooth. Another 24 hours later, here I currently am still getting sporadic pain in three molars on the same side of my mouth. With no idea how to go about treating this as none of the dentists seem to know what is wrong. \nThe pain is so bad that if it was just one tooth I would just pull it and get it over with but since it's now all three I feel stuck and uncertain."

According to the author,  With respect to mouthwash use, my general opinion is that (in the context of periodontal diseases), for the vast majority of patients, mouthwash use won't achieve a clinically relevant benefit over and above that achieved by effective mechanical plaque control (that is, brushing and interproximal cleaning), and certainly should not be regarded as a substitute for ineffective mechanical plaque control. I also think that while at present there are insufficient firm data to advise patients to stop using mouthwash because of risk of adverse general health effects."

So after I did the root canal, I went to see a new dentist that was recommended because she was apparently really great with crowns and taught dentistry at the local university.\n\nSo I go to the new dentist to do the crown and the three fillings. I gave my insurance on a Saturday with my appointment being Monday and I wanted to know what the quote was. They said they couldn't check Delta Dental over the weekend to see how much I still had for my dental benefits. I go on Monday and then they tell me that my annual limit was used up and that it would cost $1,500 for the crown. Since I was there, I decided to just pay it and get it done.\n\nNow for the three fillings I made an appointment for next Tuesday. I asked for the quote on my visit this past Monday and they said they would get back to me. My money is tied in my HSA investment account so I need to know how much to transfer it to my regular HSA account.\n\nI called them yesterday and today to get the quote and they still have not gotten back to me.

I was in a bad car wreck years ago and had extensive work done to try to prolong  them. I knew at the time it wouldn’t last. They were cracked below the gum line. The top teeth were pulled right away. \nI went and got the bottom teeth 3 days ago and now have a “ healing lower denture”. Later will get a better lasting denture.\nMy question is more for clarity. I am getting mixed info from my dentist and his tech.   My dentist told me to leave it in all the time. To remove it to rinse and gently wash my mouth and clean the denture. But not more than 5 minutes or my gums will swell. \nHe said that the following day after the procedure. \nSame day, after he left the room. His tech, a middle aged woman, who was helping me with adjusting my denture to fit and feel better. Tight spots or areas rubbing or poking, etc.  She went to reach into my mouth without asking or any warning and was rough. I naturally pull away and say no. I will remove them. She again makes a grab at my mouth.This time causing me pain. I cursed under my breath. I told her my mouth is very delicate I will do it. I handed them to her. \nShe fixed a couple of spots and handed them back for me to try, I got my eye on her. She leans in close and tells me “healing dentures do not actually help you heal. They are so people who don’t have any teeth feel better about themselves.” I thought about that for a second and of course dentures do serve the purpose of helping you eat as well. I told her that. That I am concerned about food getting into my wounds where they were pulled . But she said no. \n Before I left she said “Don’t sleep with your dentures in at night. Leave them out at all night. You will heal faster. ”\nI told her it’s only been one day. This was my second day.\nShe said “ They don’t help you heal. Leave them out.”\nI chose to not listen to her. I have left them in ss the doctor directed. But I am not sure how to proceed with her. Or if I should trust her at this point. I read they need to be in constantly for the first 3-5 days. I have a few stitches but mostly gelled up clotting.  I would call my dentist but have no way of knowing if the answer is hers or from him.    Does anyone know??????? Dr M: Good day.\n\nAn immediate set of dentures should be worn as much as possible for the first week, even when sleeping at night. Your dentist was correct, when he advised you to only take it out after meals to clean it as well as to rinse your mouth and wounds.\nThe tissues need to adapt to the form of the denture.\nI have seen cases where patients left the dentures out at night and then they were unable to put them back in the following morning.\nThe pressure of the denture on the wounds, actually helps the post-op bleeding to cease and speeds up recovery.\nListen to your dentist and not the technician."

    "dialogue": "Pundrew: TLR AT THE BOTTOM\n\nHi, I'm having a strange time trying to figure out if this is normal or not:\n\nPrior to this week, my dental hygiene was incredibly bad; that is, I only brushed once a day (at night), never flossed, and drank a lot of diet coke and coffee on most days. On top of that, when I did brush, I brushed incredibly hard - like if someone saw me brushing my teeth, they would likely believe me to be a psychopath\n\nAs a result of this, I had developed an immense sensitivity on the top right, top left, and bottom left areas of my gums (maybe it was my actual tooth not my gums?). Drinking cold beverages (including water) would give my gums a very strong sense of sensitivity, but this has been the case for quite a long time, and I have kind of gotten used to it. What came more recently, however, was a very sharp, shooting sensation of sensitivity whenever I brushed near those sensitive areas of my gums; it was so bad that there were some nights I couldn't handle the sensitivity because it was so immense that it manifested itself in a form that was much akin to phsyical pain. I was almost certain it was some sort of gum disease as a result of gum recession at my age of 22.\n\nI decided last week that I was going to do my absolute best to learn about proper dental hygiene practices. I picked up an electric toothbrush, some \"Arm & Hammer Sensitive Toothpaste\", and a whole bunch of floss picks. I started brushing twice a day, and doing so very lightly. I also started flossing after every meal for atleast a good 5 minutes. Within a week, my teeth/gums are still quite sensitive to cold drinks(which I assume will not get better until I see a dentist and get a full cleaning - I should mention I haven't been to a dentist in about 10 years...). However, that extremely sharp shooting sensation in two of the three problem areas has disappeared completely; the last one is still a bit sensitive, but I can feel that it has also made a ton of progress.\n\nSorry this was so long, but feel like I needed to add some context before coming to my actual question: Is this normal?\n\nI'm concerned that this feels \"to good to be true\", in that there's no way that, within a week, the kind of sensitivity/pain attributed to what I can only assume was some relatively serious gum disease/issue, could be alleviated completely within a week of switching to a more proper dental hygiene regimen. I fear that maybe this sensitivity will come back very soon, and that I only some how managed to \"mask\" this issue in some way.\n\nI am happy that my teeth seem to be better now and that I can finally brush without debilitating sensitivity, though I'm concerned that my optimism may be broken in the coming weeks in a way that very well might leave me back at square one.\n\nIf anyone has faced something similar or can provide some sort of insight into what might be going on, please let me know.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nTLR - Used to have terrible dental hygiene, and also brushed very hard for years which likely led to some sort of gum recession and/or disease. A week ago, I started practicing good dental hygiene practices, including using an electric toothbrush, brushing twice a day, and flossing, and the sensitivity is essentially completely gone. Is it normal that I have \"recovered\" this quickly, or is there definitely a chance that I didn't really fix anything and that the sensitivity is likely to come back? honestdoc: I'm glad you're improving your oral hygiene (OH).  \"Recovery\" times and sensitivities may vary.  For example, you may feel fine now and in next month or so you may experience some or more sensitivities.  My advice is to see the dentist ASAP.  In 10 years or more, you may have a lot of tartar (calculus) that you cannot remove.  The dentist will take x-rays to check for cavities you can't see and your bone levels if you have bone damage.  It is important to get regular check ups to avoid irreversible damage you cannot experience until too late."

Carl honestdoc: Are you sure your dentist placed a new white filling on top of your existing metal filling?  That is very unusual because the white filling does not bond to the metal.  After the filling was placed, did you feel your bite had changed?  You can ask your dentist to use a plastic stick called the \"tooth sleuth.\"  Your dentist will have you bite into the stick and you may feel discomfort when you bite down.  If you have pain when you release your bite,  your tooth may have an internal crack.  Further testing may be needed to determine if you need a root canal and or crown, or just adjust or replace the filling.

If you have pain when you release your bite,  your tooth may have an internal crack.  Further testing may be needed to determine if you need a root canal and or crown, or just adjust or replace the filling. Hi, thanks for your reply.\nI am definitely sure that I have two different types of filling in the same tooth yes. The metal one is deeper and then the whiter one sits closer to the surface. After he first fitted the white one I noticed my bite wasn’t right but this was only ‘afterwards’ when I got home. Then overnight my bite felt ok again but then came the pain. He insists the filling is sitting ok yet the pain persists when chewing.. \n\nI have to ring again Monday and this time I’m going to request to speak to the dentist directly rather than the receptionist. If I require a root canal I’d rather him just get it over and done with to avoid this. He said it’s a 50/50 chance the root canal will work otherwise I lose the tooth."

This can go along with a certain amount of inflammation, since this was a surgical procedure.\nWas this an immediate placement of an implant, were the tooth was removed simultaneously or was there a gap previously?\nIs this your first course of antibiotics since the implant was placed?\n\nSevere inflammation around an implant , especially after 1 month, could be signs of implant failure.

As I was in the chair ready for the procedure she appearently tells me that a crown will not help the pain in the tooth and that she thinks I need a mouth guard instead. I mistook what she said due to me being sedated, I thought I needed bother treatments. She proceeded to do the crown. During the procedure, the dentist filed all of the teeth on the upper left row up to my canine. I was confused as to why she was doing this. Upon leaving, I noticed a large chip in my premolar. I asked her later why she filed these teeth and she denies filing the teeth because there would not be a reason to. I am looking at having to restore the tooth now (due to pain) that was previously completely healthy. I feel this dentist made a major mistake. What should I do? Is this common? I am very distraught that she filed (and broke) my teeth for no reason. \n\n~Concerned patient Dr M: Good day\n\nIt is difficult to give an opinion about your teeth, without any clinical photos or an idea of how your teeth looked before the time. We sometimes file down teeth after a crown is done, to adjust your occlusion or \"bite\". This is done very minimally, and with the help of certain guides such as articulating paper, which indicate areas that might need adjusting. We often only adjust certain fillings or the crown itself and not even normal tooth structure. If this is what your dentist did, she should have explained this to you. Preferably prior to being sedated.\nThe fact that she mentioned you might need an occlusal guard, might indicate you have a problem with grinding your teeth, and she might have tried to balance your \"bite \" more? \nThese adjustments are usually very minimal, so again, difficult to give an opinion without more information."

(5 day course)\nFast forward to Tuesday, saw my regular dentist who told me I need to have both lower right molars extracted. Both have fitted crowns and were infected.\nOn Thursday I had both molars extracted at 11am. The lower second from my back jaw took almost 25 minutes to remove and was painful, even under anaesthetic. The dentist told me this was due to a curved root. The back molar - she could only remove the tooth, not the root and has referred me to an oral surgeon to take care of this (still waiting for referral to come through).\n\nAfter the extraction and the anaesthetic wore off I was in lot of pain which was somewhat relieved by painkillers. (paracetemol and ibu)\nThe pain has steadily got better over the last few days but I still feel swollen in the area with a stiff jaw which is also heavily discoloured (yellow) around the extraction sites and has a dull ache (but not very painful) . Could this be and infection or is this just normal granulation repair? I appreciate this is an internet forum and a diagnosis cannot be made as such but any advice would be appreciated. Thanks honestdoc: It appears normal granulation repair.  As long as you are not experiencing swelling, you should be fine.  Leaving the root to minimize trauma was wise.  Over a few days and weeks, the bone around the root will soften as the mouth tries to expel the remaining contaminant.  This will allow the root to be removed less traumatically as opposed to drilling on the bone to access the root. Tez74: Thank you for your response honestdoc. Very helpful and makes sense. Best Tez"

She seems great, very thorough, and knowledgeable.\nUpon check-up she discovered that I needed cavity fillings towards the back teeth. One of which is a wisdom tooth which has never given me issues.\nWhile performing the filling she couldn’t believe how much decay she found (X-ray didn’t do justice). It ended up being a very deep filling and quite a task for her - especially considering that the tooth was hard to access. 5-6 weeks later, when recovery was expected, I was not able to bite down on hard foods due to pain. I went back to the dentist and she discovered that there was a small crack close to the nerve. She drilled the tooth again and added more filling. There’s actually very little tooth left now, pretty much all filling!\nI was told that the problem was fixed and I would be pain free in a matter of about a week.\nWell, it’s been a week now and though it is a little better than before, I am still experiencing pain when biting on hard foods and some temperature sensitivity.\nI need to get it examined again, this will be the third time working on this tooth.\n\nIs this a somewhat typical situation? - Or should I seek a second opinion? My fear is that she might not be doing a good job and I don’t want to keep going back and having them butcher the tooth away! - I hope this is a typical situation because she’s very likable and seems like she knows what she’s doing   \nThanks! Dr M: Good day\n\nIt is difficult to give an exact opinion without any x-rays, but if there was such a deep cavity, it might be that the nerve was involved, leading to pulpitis. In such a case, the tooth would need a root canal treatment to be done. If it is a wisdom tooth however, and it is questionable if the tooth can be restored successfully after the root canal treatment, it might be a better option to remove the tooth."

I don't drink, smoke or take any meds, but I do like sugary food. Now I completely cut down on everything sweet, but I still feel really bad about this, like having a time bomb in my mouth. I went to get an appointment at a completely new dentist. They asked me if it hurts, I said not much, so I got the appointment in two weeks' time without further questions. Just by the looks, how serious is this? Should I not look for a more urgent appointment? Also, can you tell me what to expect? I would very much prefer to keep the tooth alive, is it possible to fill this once more without a root canal? honestdoc: It's hard without x-rays to view internally.  I'm suspecting you may need a root canal or very close.  You may also need a crown (very expensive).  Unfortunately sugar can cause a lot of damage as you know.  Keep calling for cancellations or find a more available dentist. A_s: If the tooth has no pain or it only has pain when exposed to air/cold/hot and lasts for seconds but does not linger, most of the case it is fine. But if you want a more precise diagnosis you will need to have a thorough examination and further tests (including radiographs) to determine whether the tooth is vital or not.  This should be treated as soon as possible but is not a dental emergency. Andrew3: Thank you, both of you, for your replies. This is relatively good news, so my tooth might still get a chance. When exposed to too much hot/cold I do feel pain that does not linger. I have decided to keep staying away from sugary food and try looking for another dentist too, however since I haven't had any serious pain yet, and even a slight pain that was present for the entire previous year after eating anything sour/sugary like apples or chocolate, I guess the former filling was not sealing perfectly and now my tooth gets some relief. I would not mind having a crown if it is done well, I even consider a gold crown if that's possible. Will try to share the results. Have a great day or night! Andrew3: UPDATE: In the end I waited out the two weeks. Dentist said exactly as you have described. I was recommended to get a new plastic filling. I did not get an x-ray or anything just another drill and fill. I felt a slight discomfort around the tooth for a week and a half. Then the filling was perfect for about half a year but is now showing signs of minor leakage again. What I mean by that is when chewing some harder food I get an occasional pain spike in that tooth. Other teeth are good. I seriously cut down on sweets, so I guess either the plastic as a filling material has the tendency to deform over time or my tendency to eat harder food such as rare steak is the culprit of such short filling life. Do you guys know a better solution that - even at the cost of higher price and more work involved - would last significantly longer? honestdoc: The tooth had a lot of damage.  A crown will last longer but it is more costly.  Make sure the tooth does not need a root canal (vital response to colds, no pain, no swelling)."

I’d love to get that done but it’s just out of reach.\n\nI’m not convinced on the decay. Tooth feels strong, I don’t sense it’s as weak as he makes it out to be, and have no real issues with it.

There is another black area under the root with the 2 root canal fillings.  It is hard to determine if the root is healing (scar in the x-ray) or diseased.  Your most important indication is swelling.  If you have no swelling, the body may be managing diseased area.  You have some options.  The most conservative is to do a filling repair on the decay.  However, it may only be short term and very difficult to access properly.  You may get a few years at best and will experience swelling and or pain (need to extract).  Depending if the 3rd tooth from the back on Upper & Lower opposes each other when you bite, you won't experience hyper-eruption of the top tooth if  the decayed tooth gets extracted.  The far back lower molar will tip forward (mesial drifting) until the bite against the top teeth stabilizes.  You may not need an implant if you get used to the empty space. PatientZero: Thank you. I really don’t want to have it extracted if I can save it. I’ve had one molar removed on the opposite side, lower, and I fully regret it. It caused the neighbouring teeth to deteriorate quickly and the opposite tooth on the upper jaw is clearly descending.\n\nTotally heart breaking to chose between debt or tooth loss in these unprecedented times.\n\nAppreciate the response, feeling a little deflated at the moment. honestdoc: I always put myself in your (patients) place and I understand your feelings.  I'm very big on prevention and I never want people's teeth and gums to deteriorate.  The best we can do at this point is to bring awareness and treatment options.  It will be a matter of time for the bad tooth to get extraction.  You don't need to have an implant.  There are other less desirable options like partial denture or just leaving it.

There is surprisingly very little pain at all, just discomfort because of how big it is.\nI was clenching my teeth a lot the night before my tooth started hurting so maybe its a fracture? but my tooth doesn't hurt anymore so I'm very confused.\nI have attached a picture. Do I need to go in to the dentist? Please help. honestdoc: Sorry, it's only a guessing game based on the image.  Based on your symptoms, I suspect the tooth root canal is necrotic  (dead) and is a source of infection (swelling).  I suspect the tooth needs extraction.

Dear dentists , can you guys give me an idea of what I would specifically need? here are a few pictures  \n\n\n\n  Thank you! honestdoc: I understand your struggles with self esteem.  You can consider a couple of ceramic veneers to match the 2 front teeth.  Keep in mind veneers are very fragile and very expensive.

But I neglected my mouth hygeine most of childhood and teens, although brushed occasionally.

Dr M: Good day\n\nIf you had extensive enamel loss, this could lead to severe sensitivity as you mentioned. Unfortunately once enamel is lost, there isn't much you can do to \" build it up again\". \nIn severe cases, you might need to consider full coverage crowns, starting on the teeth which are most severe.

Ok but everytime I ask for the white fillings, he says he is doing that so why does my teeth have the silver ones now? Is he lying to me or do they change colour?

Has he mentioned grinding to you?\nIt might also be a good idea, if you do grind your teeth, to consider having a bite plate made, or at least buy a over-the-counter mouth guard, which might be cheaper.

Next appointment in a couple of weeks to finish it off and then will get a crown put on after that. \n\nI'm just really paranoid about chewing or touching that tooth incase I \"crack\" it. I heard root canalled teeth are more brittle than regular teeth, so I'm now worried every time I eat that I might do some damage to it, even though I'm trying to chew on the other side of my mouth my teeth sometimes touch at the root canalled side while eating. I had a pretty deep filling in there before hand which has been taken out completely I believe. My question I guess is, is it safe to chew soft things on that tooth? What if I forget and chew something on it (not likely with all the worrying I'm doing!)? Am I likely to cause damage to it while I'm waiting for my second appointment? I'm basically worried that I'll cause enough damage that it will need to be extracted.

At some point she asked me if I thought it was tooth grinding which seemed odd to me. I shrugged it off and said no, how would I know anyway. But then I later looked at my teeth and could see something was off about the enamel. The tip of one of my incisors was flattened and there looked like there was some sort of hole in it. Some of my front teeth were also showing signs of wear.  \n\nWhy wouldn't a dentist just look at my teeth for signs of grinding? I'm sure she could have seen what I did if she just looked. Is it likely that she is a bad dentist? Dr M: Good day\n\nMost likely she asked about grinding because she could see signs of it. She only asked if you are aware if you grind or not. Most of the time people are not aware that they grind, and if enough enamel is damaged or lost, it could lead to sensitivity. I would suggest getting a bite plate to counter the effects of the grinding before the damage leads to more serious issues."

    "dialogue": "uggaugga: Hello, I hope I'm posting this in the correct forum and that someone can throw in their thoughts.\n\nWe took our 2 year old to the dentist as she seemed to be having some pain in her back molars. They took a look at her teeth and said they would probably need to root canal and crown every single one as the decay is extensive. I'm heart broken and absolutely scared to death about this as she will need general anesthesia. She said our insurance will cover 100% (although the pre-authorization is going to take 4-6 weeks...it's an awful long time to wait), but that's not what I'm totally worried about. Should I get a second opinion from a different dentist to be sure that she actually needs this work done or is it difficult to get a second opinion without x-rays? They didn't do x-rays on my 2 year old when we went in and said that it would be best to do it while she's under general anesthesia and then they'll run out the work plan to us, but it more sounded like she mentioned it would be to see if any need to be extracted and then get to work - she seemed pretty set that every single one needs a crown. I took a look at her teeth the best I could at home and the front bottom ones look perfectly fine - they don't look abnormal (no cavities, decay, etc.) and I'm not convinced that those ones needed work. After all, the dentist only took a look and didn't do x-rays, so if there was something there she could see, I would think I should've been able to see it, too. Part of me is just wondering if maybe we should wait, take her to the appointment, and when they have the actual x-rays that they could tell us what the treatment plan is and we say yay or nay, but even if they wanted the most money possible by doing work even if it wasn't necessary, we wouldn't know as we probably wouldn't get to see the x-rays and we're not dentists. I don't know, I am having a hard time feeling at ease with the place we took them. I'm not sure how I feel about in-house anesthesia for a 2 year old...I'm really scared.\n\nI want to do the best I can for my child, to get her treatment ASAP to avoid pain, infections, and allow her to have teeth to chew with as that's important. Would it help to try to get a second opinion if x-rays haven't even been done? I am sure most dentists can look at teeth without an x-ray and have a good general thought about what needs to be done and of course x-rays are a good confirming tool. Also, I'm not sure if a second opinion will help any because I don't want to delay my child's dental treatment any further, even though it scares me because I definitely don't want her hurting.  I know getting a second opinion, I would pay for it out of my pocket as I'm sure that insurance will not since they already had their teeth looked at and cleaned. \n\nAny thoughts on what the best thing is to do is welcome. Dr M: Good day\n\nIt does sound a bit strange that the dentist told you that the baby teeth would need root canal treatments or pulpectomies, if no x-rays were taken.\nPulpectomies are usually done in cases where the decay went into the pulp chamber of the tooth. This is usually done by confirming with an x-ray, to rule out abscess formation and open root apices etc. After such treatment, a crown can be placed on the the tooth to prevent fracture or leakage, leading to treatment failure.\nHowever, if the child complains about pain, and the pain is spontaneous, and a clear clinical cavity can be seen, it is already an indication that the cavity might be in the nerve.\nSince she is 2 years old, co-operation also might have been an issue and therefore x-rays might not have been possible.\nThat being said, you are well within your rights to seek out a second opinion.\nWithout seeing a photo or x-ray it will be difficult to assess if the first dentist gave sound advice. \nDo you perhaps have photos of the back teeth? uggaugga: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tGood day\n\nIt does sound a bit strange that the dentist told you that the baby teeth would need root canal treatments or pulpectomies, if no x-rays were taken.\nPulpectomies are usually done in cases where the decay went into the pulp chamber of the tooth.

They usually don't cooperate.\" and we got in a room. After looking on the back teeth myself, they have deep gaps in the middle that can be clearly seen so I wouldn't be surprised if those needed the root canal and then a cap, but the other ones I'm not so sure."

Usually it is done if there was extensive bone loss, due to periodontitis , leading to mobility of the teeth.

Btw i havent been to a dentist in about 7 years. A_s: Hi,\n\nYou should go to see the dentist and have this hole checked and filled.\n\nThis hole can progress deeper if you leave it alone and it can reach the nerves inside your tooth and the tooth may eventually die - then you will need root canal or extraction - which will cost more than a filling.

Ive been suffering from brainfog for the last 2 weeks as well so maybe the tooth could be the reason behind the brainfog which is my real concern. If I am being honest the dentists / doctors wont see me so I think I'm going to have to visit the hospital for futher help as its also recommended to gdt medical help if an ulcer hasnt gone within 3 weeks if I'm right? Maybe im not coping with it well because I haven't had previous pain problems with my teeth. A_s: Jimjam99 said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRight thank you.

Tooth pain from the back teeth can radiate to the side of your face, neck, ears, head and can cause headache etc. The hole - from what you have described, it has progress very deep, and close to the nerve or reaches the nerve inside your tooth already. If the dentists won't see you - then yes you can go to the hospital, but they might refer you to see a dentist. Also, if the ulcer hasn't gone in 3 weeks - need to mention it to the dentist, too."

I already wear a night guard but over this year I have woken with a locked jaw every morning. It usually unlocks within minutes but last Wednesday it didn't unlock and still hasn't. I can only open my mouth about 2cm. If I press right in front of my ear and open as wide as I can then I can force it to pop back into place, but as soon as I close my mouth it locks again. I've tried heat, massage and just waiting, but nothing is happening. I think it was stress related because I had a csection the same day it locked. honestdoc: Is your night guard custom made or store bought over-the-counter?  Try to wear a custom (very expensive though) as much as possible during the day and night.  When your TMJ is at rest, your teeth are about 1/4 inch apart.  According to experts, your teeth only touch about 20 minutes a day including meals and function.  When you exceed 20 min like grinding and clenching, you stress your TMJ to a point that can cause misery."

The calluses are abnormal tissue and could become precursors to further abnormal tissue growth (possible cancer risk).  If you guys choose to remove them, he could continue to bite on his tongue with his crowded misaligned teeth.  Keep watch on those white spots and consider removing them. Hbarca: Thanks very much. This is from another angle. Thanks again for your input. honestdoc: The whites on the side of the tongue appears normal migratory glossitis/geographic tongue.  I can't see the abnormal white spots on the top of the tongue which indicates hyperkeratosis.  Keep and eye on the calluses and consider removal especially if they are getting bigger or thicker."

Do you eat any fruit, vitamin supplements? It will be good to know a detailed list of your dietary habits and dental history. Did you change anything in the last 2 years compared to previous years?

And try to limit the frequency of eating these in a day if you can, because it takes at least 30 minutes for the pH in the mouth to rise again, when there is a drop in pH due to acidic foods including fruits. Also do not need to rinse too thoroughly after you brush your teeth with fluoridated toothpaste, so the fluoride can last in your mouth for a longer period of time.  Also try with a bit of toothpaste with flossing, too. There are also other ways that can help and I am sure your dentist will come up with the plan for you. honestdoc: Ask your dentist about prescription toothpaste that is 5000 ppm Fluoride.  I find beverages containing sugar, acid, and cream to be very destructive such as Starbucks, Red Bull/Rockstar, Gatorade, sodas, juices, etc.  If you can minimize/eliminate sources of teeth deterioration, keep up with home hygiene (floss and regular Fluoridated toothpaste), and daily use of 5000 toothpaste (leave on over night), you can expect good results."

My brother has had tooth pain for a few days but it has gradually worsened, his face is now swollen and he is vomiting, this may be because he feels too sick to eat and when he tries he brings the food back up. He may feel sick because he is taking strong painkillers. He also has COPD and has an emergency pack which includes Amoxicillin, after searching online he started taking the antibiotics yesterday but this is just making him feel more sick.  I’m really worried as he doesn‘t have a dentist.  What could he eat to try to stop the sickness? He says he wants to try the antibiotics for a few days to see if this improves the pain, swelling so that he can then stop taking the pain killers.  It’s like a vicious circle, he takes the pain killers and antibiotics for the pain and swelling which makes him too nauseous to eat and not eating makes the sickness worse.  What should he do?  Thank you. Dr M: Good day\n\nI assume he doesn't have any allergy to penicillin?\nMake sure the antibiotics that was in his emergency pack is not past the expiry date. \nAntibiotics sometimes take about 2-3 days to kick in, and then the pain will also gradually decrease, and then he can reduce the pain meds.\nIt also sometimes gets a little worse before it gets better.\nIf the swelling doesn't disappear, or at least reduces in about 3 days, or if it increases even more, it might be necessary to go to a medical doctor in order to be placed on stronger, or more broad spectrum antibiotics. If left untreated, this could lead to the swelling spreading to other areas, blocking the airway and leading to a medical emergency.\nSome antibiotics also needs to be taken with meals, in order to limit vomiting or nausea, and if very severe, try and get a probiotic at the local pharmacy.\nUsually swelling goes hand in hand with inflammation, so make sure the painkillers he is taking, is anti-inflammatory.\n\nOn another related note-if the swelling is tooth related, he should make an appointment with a dentist as soon as possible to treat the cause of the infection.\n\nHope this helps.

Thank you so much for your reply,we managed to get an emergency appointment with an NHS dentist that afternoon, they couldn’t take any x rays or even touch him much as it was so painful but they said he has an abscess and gave him another antibiotic and he has to go back in four days, the swelling has gone down since yesterday and he’s even managed to eat a couple of biscuits and two weekabix so hop he is on the mend."

You have severe acid erosion of your teeth, and that will be a long term worry unless you stop your acidic drinks/foods. Vandy: Thanks for your reply. I just have a hypothetical question. Considering the way that decay looks right now, supposing a thin layer of fluoride varnish were to be applied just on that brown spot, would it seal off the food supply to the bacteria and stop the decay from progressing further, or would the decay still continue to progress underneath the varnish?\n\nThanks for pointing out the acid erosion issue. I have stopped such acidic drinks/foods, but for the damage already done, is there anything I can later ask my dentist to do for that, to prevent caries on those eroded areas in future (such as fluoride varnish or something else applied on the eroded areas)?

Now, this full zirconia crown has a hole in it! It's been LESS than a year. I had this confirmed by my new dentist. She said there's definitely a hole in it and I have to get it replaced. \n\nI've had this crown for less than a year and it's obviously faulty. What options do I have financially? I paid a lot of money to get this crown put in and feel like it was done very poorly. My insurance benefits says they'll only replace a crown that's at least 5 years old. I don't really want to go back to the old dentist even if they offer to do the work for free since I don't trust them. How can I get this covered? I'm so frustrated over this. honestdoc: Not defending your dentist but perforations on lower 2nd molar crowns happen more often than we like.  Those teeth are usually shorter and can lack retention if the dentist shortens the inner structures (prep) more to thicken the crown.  Anatomically, the opposing molar has a prominent palatal cusp that can wear down the lower biting surface.  On my tooth, the upper molar had worn it down significantly prompting me to wear a bite guard. Dr M: I agree with honestdoc.\nI sometimes grind down the opposing tooth if it has a filling on it, in order to reduce the wear on the crown. MattKW: I'd approach the dentist who did the crown. Politely contact them and send this photo by email, ask them what they would be willing to do about the problem and give them 2 weeks for a response. We all carry insurance and I've used mine a couple of times in my career. Ideally, a zirc crown shouldn't be adjusted, but if necessary, then using a pair of calipers is essential in such a tight spot to keep enough thickness.\nWhen redoing the crown, the tooth will have to be shortened more, and consider a full (precious) gold crown. They are ideal for 2nd molars. MattKW: Dr M said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI agree with honestdoc.\nI sometimes grind down the opposing tooth if it has a filling on it, in order to reduce the wear on the crown. Reduction of the opposing tooth should ideally only be done after extra-oral adjustment as far as possible, and then only a little bit of reduction might be needed after cementation. It's nearly always the opposing healthy palatal cusp of the opposing tooth, so it should be kept to a minimum. I've never had the opportunity to reduce a filling in this situation. But if it was a filling, then you would run the risk of not knowing how thick the remaining filling would be after adjustment."

This led to a general discomfort in my mouth, and one of my lower front tooth particularly hurting. This tooth is angled slightly outward because the adjacent teeth pushed on it.\n\nI went to a new dentist since I moved and my old one is now a bit to far from my home. I said that it hurt during the day, but not at any specific time, and not constantly, and that it might have been sensible for a month at most but I really noticed it this week.\n\nHe then explained to me that it was due to my occlusion (upper teeth getting over lower teeth) and we had to proceed with a filing. Since I wasn't offered any other choices I said okay, although it didn't really feel like I was offered a choice either.\n\nI went two days after to the same place, for a cleaning this time. The second dentist who took a look at my teeth was made aware of the filing and told me that looking at my teeth he knew I have an habit of clenching my jaw/grinding my teeth when I'm stressed, and told me it was the reason for my discomfort, since if I had no problems in years, my occlusion wouldn't suddenly made me hurt within a week. Thinking of it he is right, because since he mentioned it I'm catching myself grinding my teeth a lot.\n\nNow I just think that I had enamel reduced for absolutely no reason and I feel very upset about it...\n\nI'd like to kindly ask if anyone has thoughts on this, am I the only one who feels like the first diagnosis was wrong and the dentist went ahead with an irreversible action without asking much questions ? I just feel wronged..\n\nThank you! Dr M: Good day\n\nWe don't have much information to go on, since we don't have any pictures or x-rays.\nUsually reducing healthy enamel in order to alleviate an occlusal grinding problem, would only be done as a last resort. We don't sacrifice healthy tooth structure for no reason. \nIf you had a grinding problem, I would have suggested making a bite plate first, to wear during the night and to then follow up if the symptoms persists or not.\nIf the grinding is a combination of stress as well as an adverse occlusal relationship, a referral to an orthodontist might have been a better option. The specialist would have advised if treatment was needed in order to improve the occlusal relationship to a more harmonious situation.\n\nHope this helps a bit."

    "dialogue": "Haileyapps: Hi, \n\nSo I was told that there was an abscess beneath my bottom right wisdom tooth by my dentist in late April. He had also let me know about a cavity between my second bicuspid and first molar (i believe) on my top right side about 6 months before that appointment without doing x-rays for cost reasons. He told me it was too small to do anything about yet, but that we’d keep an eye on it. So the x-rays in April were the first that I had done in about a year, and I'm not too sure how long the abscess was there. \n\nI asked about the cavity and he told me to get the wisdom teeth removed and then get back to him. I had to pay out of pocket for the surgery and I couldn't get it done in my home state so I went a couple states away to have it done. Afterwards I had to come home just one week after the surgery. Before I left I noticed that one of my two lower surgical sites hadn’t healed closed yet, the right side, the one that had the abscess beneath it. I called the office, but they said check back in three weeks, which I couldn’t do. So i came home, and felt okay until early June. I think the pain started because I wear a nightguard for my grinding and clenching. \n\nOne of my top front teeth chipped last year. It stayed confined to that one small area until earlier this year the chip turned into a crack that ran up the enamel the whole length of the tooth. My two front teeth are pretty tight together and when I wear my night guard it puts a lot of pressure on them. When my teeth became sensitive in early June, wearing the night guard became way too painful. I stepped up my oral hygiene but my teeth were still causing me quite a bit of pain. \n\nMy regular dentist was closed because of covid for all of June, but he reopened in July and I was able to get an appointment on July 5th . On that day we did an x-ray which was limited to the specific area that he knew there was a cavity for price reasons. He told me that it did seem like that cavity was ready, so he scheduled another appointment a week later to fill it. In that time, my sensitivity was pretty bad but more concerning was this pressure that I felt building in the back of my mouth also on the top right side. In the hours before I went to get the filling, the pressure really felt like it was going to explode. I just couldn't tell where or how. The pressure didn't feel like it was near any points of exit. I had a pulsing headache and felt like shit. \n\nThat filling was my dentist’s last scheduled appointment of the day and even though i wanted to bring up the pressure building in the back of my mouth, he was in a bit of a rush and I didn’t want to push the subject. Also, this dentist my dad has paid out of pocket for years and years and i knew that my dad owed him some money at that point, and i was grateful he was even seeing me for that filling. I referred vaguely to that area and he noticed a place where I had pricked myself with the end of a floss pick and told me it was a traumatic ulcer. He was right but that wasn't what I meant. \n\nI had just received government healthcare not too long before that and I thought it might include dental care but i hadn’t called or went online to see yet. That’s what motivated me. I found out I did have a free checkup every 6 months and I figured that I could get some full mouth x-rays that might tell me what was going on above my back top right teeth. I went in and had them done but the dentist told me that I was fine. I just had some tartar and needed a little bit of cleaning. He did that and told me it was good to go. I didn't want to push the issue so I said okay and just asked if I could maybe get a copy of my x-rays. They said sure and emailed them to me.\n\nJust looking at the x-rays I think that I can see the area that felt odd. My idea was to post them on a dental forum so that i didn't have to go to another checkup with no clue how to describe whats bothering me, but even thinking about it has caused me such intense dread that I’ve put it off for more than two months now. I've used sensodyne periodically since June and my sensitivity is SO much better but my entire mouth has still been so irritated (gum irritation or small cracks in teeth - i can’t tell) that i take an ibuprofen for it at least once a day. So the swelling is my main concern but i am having some other issues that i could use advice on too.\n\nThank you! honestdoc: A lot of what you mentioned does not make sense.  First, you have no wisdom teeth.  2nd, I'm not seeing any disease on Upper Right x-rays.  3rd, the x-ray that you provided with the circle is the Upper Left and depicts normal anatomy (sinus and cheek bone).   We cannot see swelling on x-rays because it doesn't pick up soft tissue.  It only shows bone, teeth, fillings, or anything radiopaque.  Does your pain and swelling come and go?  I believe your dentist did not detect any swelling.  I'm suspecting you may have sinus pain.  You can get it checked by a physician.  You can also provide more information to help us determine what's going on.  Your bite is not ideal.  Ideal bite is a slight over bite where your lower anteriors are tucked underneath you uppers and not edge to edge.  If you are having pain and discomfort with your bite guard, have it adjusted. If it is not custom made, try to get one.  With your edge to edge bite, you will chip and fracture more."

Unfortunately after months of checkups I was notified the implant did not integrate and has to be taken out. Is the implant placed too close to the adjacent tooth? Could that be the reason of failure, and is there any potential harm in the future to that adjacent tooth? I'm a little worried about taking this out because it's been a long time and I already have many small scars and a cleft on my gum from all the previous procedures. Any answers would be greatly appreciated! honestdoc: There is a lot of information we don't know.  It seems that the adjacent front tooth has an incomplete root canal.  The x-ray can be misleading since it only provides a 2 dimensional view.  Did a specialist or a general dentist place the implant?  Where did you get the implant?  Do you have diabetes and or do you smoke?  I'm not an implant specialist and I suggest you consult with a periodontist or oral surgeon on your condition. Dr M: Good day\n\nUsually there has to be a minimum of 2mm between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Since this is only a 2-D x-ray, it is difficult to give an opinion on the spacing, but it is rare that this is a cause of failure. In your case bone grafts was done, since there might not have been sufficient bone quality and quantity prior to the implant placement. It happens quite often that the bone grafts also become problematic.\nAfter an implant is placed, some time is given in order for it to achieve stability in the bone. If no stability is achieved, the implant cannot be loaded, which means a crown cannot be placed on it.

If I did go, the dentist would probably just say I don't need it or he'd offer me a fluoride treatment, but high fluoride toothpaste sounds like a very safe and cheap precautionary measure, especially with no children around. I read it can even treat root caries. I don't need to visit a dentist if I use a \"teledentist\" and I read teledentists are cheaper. Any advise on finding an internet based teledentist for this? This isn't even close to an emergency and I'm not comfortable going to a dentist's office for this. I'm in New York City. honestdoc: It is hard for a dentist in the US to prescribe you anything if you are not a patient of record and if you had no recent evaluations.  You can try some Canadian pharmaceutical sites (I'm not familiar with any) and try to obtain some.  Since you haven't been to a dentist in a long time, we won't know if you have any cavities, gum disease or any other oral diseases.  Do you have a fear of the dentist, concerned with costs, and or difficult transportation/schedule issues? Toofs: It's a cost issue as well as fear I'll be over treated. If something hurts long and hard enough I'll go, or if a filling falls out I'll go. I didn't go for a recent toothache which I think was an abscess. It seems to have cleared up and I'm brushing and string flossing at least three times a day plus using a Waterpik once a day, sometimes with antibacterial mouthwash, especially around my wisdom tooth that's partially covered by my gum, where I believe food entered, caused gum irritation, then the toothache and abscess in the molar next to it. I know all about bacteria hanging around after drainage but I'm throwing so much at it that I bet it won't come back. I'm also chewing Xylitol gum, taking vitamin D, drinking more fluoridated water, using CPC mouthwash twice a day, and fluoride mouthwash once a day (I do a mini-brush before the fluoride mouthwash so I actually brush 3-1/2 times a day. I did research and I know it's rare for such a thing to lead a life threatening condition, and I'm taking almost unheard of care of my teeth and gums.\n\n^^^ I didn't really want to go there because I've been there on another forum and heard from dentists who saw a photo of my teeth. I was told I don't have periodontitis. I already made the decision not to see a dentist. I'll either continue with the above regimen or start with a high fluoride toothpaste and omit a couple of steps. I think the high fluoride toothpaste would be better for me because I don't like all the extra chemicals I'm getting from all the products I'm using and I don't like the extra abrasion from the extra brushing, but I'll continue and try to be careful.\n\nOh, I also bought a thermometer to check my temperature in case the toothache comes back. It's been normal since I started checking. honestdoc: I understand your dislike of the dentist.  Unfortunately there are a lot of dentists in the US that are hungry and may over-treat especially in an expensive area like California.  I do like for you to reconsider and try to find a good dentist your friends and family trusts.  You're always able to get different opinions if the dentist recommends extensive treatment.  All too often I get people that come for emergency only and I can't help their deteriorating teeth and gums other than pulling their teeth.  The worse case was when this lady came in for intense facial swelling of LL.  It turned out to be terminal oral cancer that ate up and fractured the jaw bone and nerves as she was both in pain and numb on that side.  She was suffering so much that I thought she only had a few days to live."

I got this checked out at the dentist’s yesterday, but the dentist did not do a good job of explaining what I can expect from a follow-up visit and what the cause of my symptoms were. The visit went as follows:\n\nI told them about the tooth and some gum issues I was having elsewhere (redness/bleeding when brushing, mild and usually short-lived; they said it looked like a cut or burn in a very cut/burn-prone area)\nThey tested the tooth I hurt and found it slightly more sensitive to cold, but not by much.\nThe dentist prescribed antibiotics for the gum issue, but she did not feel that there was reason to “open the tooth” and that I should come back in a couple weeks once the antibiotics have done their work.\nI asked a lot of questions about what could be causing the persistent pain if the tooth doesn’t need to be “opened” (I’m assuming that means a root canal?), but the dentist answered as though I was talking about my gum issue every time I tried to clarify the question. I’m very confused and am not sure what to expect from the follow-up visit in two weeks, and am not sure if the main reason for my visit was really addressed.\n\nCan persistent tooth pain from (seemingly shallow) mechanical damage that lasts for days go away on its own/with antibiotics? If not, what exactly should I expect from the follow-up? honestdoc: I think the dentist unnecessarily prescribed you antibiotics.  I would only do it if you have any swelling.  Take some anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and if it doesn't improve and you can't tolerate the pain, then you may need a root canal."

At first I thought it might be related to my wisdom teeth,  but so far they have all been coming in with no problems or any pain up to this point. The tooth itself did not hurt. Upon looking, I realized that there is actually a small cut or puncture that i think is causing the pain. It had caused some slight pain when swallowing and had made eating more difficult because there is some pain when that part of my mouth moves. I took a picture where you can see the cute/wound I’m talking about. I have no idea what I could have done to cause this.\nI just want to know if this is likely to be wisdom tooth related or if I should just treat it like any other cut and let it heal on it’s own. honestdoc: A good assessment would be if you continue to get the same cut on the same location, then consider having the upper wisdom tooth involved removed.  If it is a one time event, the cut usually heals uneventfully if it is left untraumatized.  If you have a lot of pain, I like the Over-the-Counter Colgate Orabase topical anesthetic gel.  It sticks to the cut and won't wash away.  However, it is very hard to get so you may have to look online.  If you get a canker sore on the area, have your dentist prescribe Kenalog in Dental Paste."

The filling is a composite filling and I was told at the time it was a really deep one. It took ages to settle and went back several times to have it adjusted due to sensitivity etc. Even after that it hurt to chew hard food on.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I had horrendous pain around that general area. I thought I had a sinus infection as using decongestants etc seemed to rectify it and my entire cheek near my nose hurt. The sinus pain/tooth pain went away after a couple of days. I was going to call the dentist but after the pain went I didn't class myself as an emergency, and it's very difficult to get an appointment at the moment because of the Corona virus.\n\nAfter the sinus trouble I now have no pain in that tooth when I chew food anymore, however there is pressure around the very top of my mouth (where the gum meets the upper lip). As I've been worried I had a feel around and noticed that the right hand side feels completely different to the other side. Basically it feels more lumpy and bony above that tooth which isn't present on the other side. They mostly don't hurt but one bony lump is quite tender when I press hard on it (kind of like pressure going down into the filled tooth). It kind of feels like part of my bone but find it strange I can't feel this on the other side? I'm a bit of a hypochondriac so worry about things like tumours  \n\nI'm just wondering, is is normal to be able to feel the tops of teeth on one side but not the other? Could it be something to do with the filled tooth? Or the sinus infection? I've tried to attach a picture but where it is it's incredibly difficult to get a decent one, and there isn't actually anything visible really.\n\nThanks so much! Dr M: Good day\n\nIt is very difficult to see anything on the attached photo. \nIf the filling was indeed a deep filling, it is possible that the nerve was chronically irritated, leading to pulpitis. If the pulpitis became irreversible,  it is also possible that the nerve died. \nWithout any form of x-ray it is unfortunately impossible to give more information.\nThere could have been an abscess that drained, and in some cases, abscesses can actually turn into a cyst, especially on a non-vital tooth, and this then feels hard and round when touching it.\nBut for this diagnoses, a x-ray would be required.\nMy advice would be to go and see a dentist as soon as possible, to have an x-ray taken and have the tooth's vitality tested.

    "dialogue": "Chiswick: I have been going through dental implant placement since last November 2019 which was with a surgical guide placement for 4 implants 5 hours in dental chair and had to have two of those removed in February due to the fact that more bone needed to be grafted in. We went back in end of April to replace the ones that were removed. I had normal dental pain of course for a couple of days not bad but at the end of fourth day I had a very painful spot in the back of the right side of lower jaw radiating down to my gland. Almost like a side effect of the novacaine needle shot. I took 800 mgs. of Ibuprofen for it and it basically subsided for the time being. In June, it wasn't getting better with the gland and I went in to see my dentist and he said the swelling was no way near the implant and that I would ordinarily see the ENT but he would only send me back to them hmmmmmm....and prescribed clindamycin for 7 days - took x-ray and then said I am booking you for periodontist for possible removal of that implant in three days. So we did that and the periodontist said swelling would improve which it gradually did. I did have a very sore salivary gland after that especially after eating. Eventually that resolved but I continued to have a sore spot where in the back where I believe again the needle was placed. I went to see ENT and he said that there was a small skin absence there and it was draining like a boil. Most likely due to needle insertion. He prescribed clindymycin for 10 days and it helped it drain. In the meantime he sent me for CT scan.\n\nAt followup the results surprisingly the results did not show anything in the infected area, clearing up nicely and no further antibiotics needed but he told me that I had a 1.5 cm mass in the submandibular region on the LEFT (Incidental finding) that would need further investigation and booked me for U/S. We also did my thyroid as I have benign nodules that needed followup - last U/S was seven years ago along with a negative biopsy back then.\n\nI had another follow-up of U/S results with ENT - thyroid ok - check in another year. However, the radiologist was unsure of the node in the submandibular area whether it is just enlarged gland 1.5 cm or abnormal gland - same as on original CT and said FNA should be scheduled. Said it could be tricky to get into the area. ENT said well we just go in normally and remove it. I said I would prefer biopsy first as this was discovered incidentally and has not bothered me before. (I'm thinking with all my dental work of course this could be a side effect). My periodontist said I just think the ENT is being extra cautious.\n\nI had a followup with periodontist following week and the boil was still draining - he prescribed levoquin for 10 days and said that would knock it right out.\nYes it did even though I was hesitate to take this antibiotic with all the side effects listed I took it anyway. Fine - it cleared but after about 2 weeks I noticed the draining again. I am seeing my perio next week.\n\nI had biopsy this week. Radiologist was an expert at his technique along with guided U/S and was able to get three good samples both superiorly and anteriorly to another smaller node which had a fatty hilum (good) and then was able to get inside the node. I heard him say to technician is it 1 cm and she said yes. (I remember seeing on report it was 1.5 cm originally so it may have gone down and may have been reactive. My followup is September 22 - i figure if anything bad they will call but still like everyone on here I am stressing.\n\nSeeing periodontist next week to see if anything further needs to be done for site where I had injection for novacaine. Some days it looks good - other days like it still has a little infection in it.\n\nSo I have had full dental CT scan when I started this journey and no nodes showed up on these and what I am thinking is that all this dental trauma and implant surgery and removal and more bone having to be put in can of course cause lymph gland swelling in the floor of the mouth. Because I did have reactive nodes under chin which cleared as I healed over the weeks.\n\nMy upper few implants are fine and that is complete - it's the bottom that has had complications since more bone was needed and that takes 6 months to get to the point where the implant will be able to osseointegrate into the bone.\n\nSo was it a good time to get CT scan and U/S when my body was reacting to all the dental work? I think probably not - because of lymph node reactions.\n\nThoughts? Dr M: Good day\n\nLymph nodes can sometimes swell up if there was an acute or chronic infection. \nWas the implant on the affected side removed by the periodontist or is it still in situ? How is the bone looking around the implant? Did the additional bone augmentation integrate well? If it is not healing, the bone graft or implant might be failing and this \" infectious\" and inflammatory process might be contributing to the lymph nodes that feel palpable.\nIf there is infection in the bone, it could lead to areas of necrotic bone and osteomyelitis which will need to be scraped clean after implants were removed. I have seen cases with osteomyelitis which also have small draining areas.\nUnfortunately without and post op x-rays or CT scan it is difficult to give an opinion about if this could be a possible cause. \nIt doesn't always take 6 months for implants to integrate with bone. I have restored cases where implants were ready for loading in about 10-12 weeks. This might be longer in your case, because of additional bone grafts.\nBased on you past medical history of benign lesions, I think it is prudent that the ENT is being over-cautious about the submandibular mass."

There are sudden start of pain at night, but after I take brufen it stops. I am attaching Xrays, is it possible I can evade extraction or the fracture is too severe? Expert recommendation will be appreciated. In the Xray, its the bottom first tooth from left. honestdoc: How does the tooth responds to cold?  If it responds to cold sensitive of short duration, then the nerve is still good.  Do you have any swelling?  If no swelling, you don't need to extract.  I notice some cavities on adjacent teeth.  I would cut back on any sweet/acidic/creamy beverages if you can to minimize further damage to your teeth. Dr M: I agree with honestdoc. Just also remember, trying to medicate away a problem instead of treating the cause, might lead to other problems such as a stomache ulcer with excessive Ibuprofen. nmj: After the filling, the tooth responds to cold sensitive for short duration. I can eat soft stuff but I feel sudden start of pain at night but subsides after I take Ibubrufen. As mentioned, I dont want to take too much ibubrufen.

The dentist needs to find the source of pain at night.  Sounds like you may not be on the same page as your dentist and may need to get a different opinion.  If the source of pain is LR6 (#30), then you can have a root canal, core filling, crown to save the tooth or extraction."

But the gap between two feels not hard and feels like a gap in between. Is this normal? How long does it take to close completely? All the area should feel hard when we run over the tongue?\nI also see a white pimple like boil blister on the gum of the extraction site. Its been there for past 2 weeks. I have some lower jaw pain under the earlobe for 3.months and I extracted the upper wisdom tooth as dentist said that could be the reason. But my symptoms got worse after the extraction.\nI still have the lower jaw pain.\nIs the gap between the molars take time to get hard?\nI couldn't differentiate if I get any pain from the extraction site now since I have TMJ issue and pain in the lower jaw and in front of the ear. It's so painful.\nDo I need to go back to dentist to check this blister and gap between second molar& extraction site or is this normal?"

I will go find one, but I am wondering if by looking at the radiogram can it be determined if I need bone graft before an implant? honestdoc: You will need bone grafting for implants.  Keep in mind the graft will not rebuild lost horizontal bone.  It can only integrate into vertical defects."

To be honest it was weird. \n\nAfter that the pain kick hard for the first two week. During that first 2 week I get 6 piece of tooth or bone out of my tooth hole. I had to to take antibiotic for 1 week cause of an infection. A little bit of pus was coming out. \n\nNow its been a month and the hole still open and I take out 3 other piece of bone or teeth. Theres still a little pus you can see on one photo and on the other it's one of the total 9 pieces I take off my tooth hole during that month. \n\nDue to covid here in east Canada we have dentist available. What should I do? ER or I just freaking out for nothing and let that heal by hitself? honestdoc: Lower molars can be very traumatic to remove.  It's not unusual to have pieces of dead bone exfoliating.  However, the hole should be closing 1 month after.  The best is to go back to the dentist who removed it and have it looked at.  Hopefully you are not a heavy smoker.  If so, you are preventing it from healing properly. MaximeOuellet: Hi Doc! Thanks for that fast reply! Way faster than any dentist here haha! \n\nFor the smoking part, I quit cigarette in January. So now im smoke free. \n\nI also get back to this dentist 4 times! He still say that healing good... \n\nBut like I said yesterday, its been a month and the hole is still wide open. Another bones part exfoliating today. The count is now to 10 bones part remove in a month. And the pus still there. Low quantity of pus yes, but its still there. \n\nIts already cost me around 700-800$ for a single teeth. I fear that the hole slowly close and trap the pus inside with remaining bones parts and change in alveolite osteitis. I just saw that on internet, maybe im too easily scared haha."

    "dialogue": "Juranders: Hey I made this account specifically to ask this question so apologies if this isn’t in the correct area. My teeth have been this way every since I remember, I have an overbite(my bottom front teeth lean inwards) to the point where my top teeth can completely cover the bottom. I have very short teeth where you can barely seen any of the top row when I smile and the only way for any of the back teeth to touch the other row(top and bottom) is if I were to overbite to the point where my bottom teeth are no longer visible. My tongue hangs over my back teeth naturally. I’ve been to the dentist and I know I need some fillings and possibly braces for my overbite but they never talked about my back teeth(though they did mention that I had very short teeth roots). My back teeth have been starting to hurt and my jaw is in an uncomfortable position(either hanging open or overbite) the sad thing is that I’m only 18. Is there anything I should do, is there anything that can be done? Dr M: Good day\n\nDo you perhaps have any x-rays ?  It might be possible that the problem with your back teeth, might also be related to your wisdom teeth. You are at the right age for it .\nWith regards to the front teeth- an overbite is usually corrected with orthodontic treatment. If you are undergoing ortho, they sometimes also allow your posterior teeth to over-erupt in order to correct the overbite. \nSo orthodontic treatment will be focused on your entire arch of teeth and not only on the front teeth. Any other discrepancies, will also then be addressed during the orthodontic treatment. honestdoc: I foresee a couple of potential problems.  If you roots are short, braces can shorten them even more.  If your jaws are in an uncomfortable position, braces can stress your jaw joints (TMJ) even more.  If braces is appropriate, make sure you see a well-respected and experienced orthodontist because I've seen too many failed cases. Dr M: I agree with honestdoc. An experienced orthodontist will treat a case with short roots in such a way to prevent any future complications. The only other way to decrease an increased overbite, would then be some sort of prosthodontic rehabilitation."

    "dialogue": "Neil_of_wales: Hi everyone.\nI am new to this forum, and am 41 years old. But have been quite stressed out about the state of my mouth the last few months. I am aware I suffer with gum disease as u have not visited a dentist in 17 years, and I have at least 4 snapped teeth and 1 dropped wisdom tooth. but its got so bad now that all my gums bleed with ease, either by brushing them or even rubbing either the back or from the of them with my finger quite soft. Also very strangely when I get a quarter of a cup of water with a teaspoon of salt dissolved and I swish it around for 50 seconds, the salty water will make some of my teeth gush out blood. This happens all the time as well.\n\nIts got to the point now as well where there is white mushy stuff coming out of my gums that smells worse than poo, its a foul stench. Very similar to the stuff that builds up on tonsils during tonsillitis. I get it when swirling my mouth put with water.  Now today I've noticed a red patch has developed on the inside of my top gum behind my top teeth, I'm not sure if that should be a cause for concern.\n\nI quit smoking 2 months ago but drink most nights, I now brush my teeth twice daily and use a ginivitis mouth wash along with salty water.is this severe gum disease, or is something else wrong here? I am worried as surely gum disease is never this bad, do I have an infection ? please give me some good news because I am so stressed its causing problems between me and my giirl friend. honestdoc: The only way to diagnose gum disease is to take full mouth x-rays to evaluate the bone levels and complete full mouth gum probe to check gum attachments.  The lower the numbers on the gum probe the better indicating healthier, tighter gums.  \n\nNot visiting for 17 years can present neglected conditions.  Hopefully you don't have the fear of the dentist.  If you don't see the dentist, nobody can diagnose and treat your teeth and gums. Neil_of_wales: Thanks for the reply. The reason I haven't visited the dentist in so long has been down to financial costs, and struggling to find a dentist that will take me on as a patient. Also now with covid 19 dentists here in the UK are only seeing patients who are deemed an emergency.\n\nLooking at my pics and going on what I've told you, would ypu say this sounds like severe gum diaease ? Bacteria in my gums and snapped teeth, and salty water making the water turn red just dosent seem right. I think that red patch might be a cut from some criaps I had  earlier in work today, but I'm not sure. I've attached a pic of the red patch honestdoc: I see the red patch.  I'll tell you why I can't give you an accurate diagnosis.  In my 23 yrs of being a dentist, I've seen many gums that look like yours and the bone is in good shape.  Also I've seen just as many gums like yours and the bone is in bad shape.  I don't have x-ray vision to see internally so what I'm seeing doesn't really count.  For your info, gums will heal great if your bone is good.  If your bone is bad, you lost permanent attachment that the bone cannot regain.  For a rough guess because there are some genetic components, how are your parents' teeth and gums?  If they have dentures at an early age, chances are your bone levels may not be good."

Please be careful not to use these on the highest setting, since it can damage your enamel. That said-it looks like you had areas of de-calcification of your enamel.

My dentist says that only the enamel cracked, but that I was ultimately fine. My tooth turned very slightly darker almost immediately after the fall (the dentist saw this), and has remained that way ever since, without any more darkening to my knowledge. Every now and again, I experience some minor mobility and sensitivity to cold.\n\nSo, I have a few questions:\n\nIs it possible that my tooth is dying even though there has been know signs of worsening over the last year, or is this just \"how it is\" now? Would it help AT ALL to bleach the tooth using an at-home whitener? The difference is minor, but it still bugs me, nonetheless.\n\nHere's a picture: \n\n\n\n\nThanks for your help! Dr M: Good day\n\nUsually if a tooth turns grey in colour, after a traumatic incident, it might be indicative that the nerve has died due to the incident. The fact that the tooth is sometimes mobile, might be indicative that there is also some peri-apical pathology ( root tip problem ). My advice would be to go and see dentist, to have an x-ray taken and to have pulp tests done on the tooth. Most likely the tooth will need a root canal to be done. After the tooth has been root canal treated, non-vital bleaching can be done to restore the colour, although the results is unpredictable and the process would have to be repeated after a certain amount of time. Another option would be to crown the tooth, which would be a more permanent option."

There is a gap between the gum and cap.\nThis lump has been there for 12months and causes me no pain or issue but we have just lost a family member to cancer so I have been convinced to see the dentist. I spoke to them today and they want me to see them and they mentioned the c word which has really made me nervous. It looks like an abscess based on google but the dentist said it wouldn’t be a an abcess as it’s been there for a year. \nI have attached a pic is anyone has any ideas, I will see the dentist but really anxious now. honestdoc: The lesion looks like an abscess even though you mention that it has been there for a year.  Abscess physiology can be unpredictable but most likely the abscess has been draining which is why you're not experiencing too much pressure and facial swelling.  A less likely possibility could be a cyst.  An x-ray could help map out the internals and I suspect the tooth with the crown and failing root canal to be the source.  Fortunately the borders look regular so it is not fast growing (most likely not cancer).  Google Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the mouth.  It is the most common cancer in the oral cavity.  Notice on the google images that the borders are irregular and the lesions look ugly (various and irregular patterns of white and red colors).   Of course we dentists recommend you see us regularly.  All too often we encounter phobic and unrealistic people that avoid us until the last resort and expect miracles. pau1200: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe lesion looks like an abscess even though you mention that it has been there for a year.

Thankyou for your reply, I have googled like you have said and can see what you mean, it doesnt look like any of the cancer pictures. I am visiting the dentist later on today so hoping for a good outcome. Our dentists is a large practice with about 20 dentists but they all seem quite young and even though good they don’t seem to have learned how to deal with nervous patients. I did find a dentist who was great that spent the extra time and explained everything and even when injecting into the gums I felt nothing but he left the area. I did find a picture I took 12 months ago and it looks the same, size and shape, if it was cancer I assume it would have altered in some way?\nAgain thanks again for your reply, you sound like the sort of dentist I need to find pau1200: Ok, so I have seen a dentist and she was unsure what it is. She used a load of words I didn’t understand but she said there is no pocket and she doesn’t think it periodontal in nature. There is no gum disease but it’s hard. She also said it doesn’t bleed either when poking with the sharp tool. They x-rayed it and she said there was no bone deterioration. She didn’t think it cancerous as it hasn’t changed in shape and size and if it was cancerous it would generally be fast growing and bleed which it isn’t. She said it might be fibro something but she is going to refer me to a surgeon and have a biopsy to see what it is but they will also cut it out.\nStill feeling really nervous about it all as I am\nStill worried about it being cancerous or some strange type. I was hoping she would have been able to diagnose it. honestdoc: Could you provide an x-ray?  I believe it is most likely from the crown with root canal.  Where are you located?  A good evaluation may be from an endodontist (root canal specialist) and if the lesion is still unknown after that eval, then possible biopsy. pau1200: Hi,\n\nI did ask for a copy of my X-ray but they wouldnt let me have it as it’s not procedure. Unsure why as I had to pay for it. She did say there was nothing showing on the X-ray and no bone damage. I did mention that there has always been a gap between the bottom of the crown and the gum line and was it possible that food could have got stuck, she did ask if I get food stuck in that location and I did. She did mention that it would be painful if it was cancerous, if I press it it’s sore but not painful. She did seem to think it was a fibro overgrowth or something like that. I’m sorry I can’t give you any more information than that.  I know reading the internet is never a wise thing but when I look at pictures it does look like an abcess. Can abscesses be hard or are they always soft. I am in the Birmingham area of the UK honestdoc: Have your dentist refer you to endodontist to eval your root canal tooth.  Last resort, refer to oral surgeon.  I'm not sure about the laws in the UK since I'm in the US, but here we routinely send digital images to specialists or colleagues at no charge (some do charge but many will not charge for good will). MattKW: Shouldn't be charging you much if anything at all for a copy of the Xray, you have a right to get copies although sometimes there may be a \"reasonable fee\". They can't say it's \"not their procedure\". Like honestdoc, I've never charged for accessing records. Looks like abscess assoc with a dead tooth. pau1200: Thanks for the feedback, it has made me realise my current dentist isn’t that great so today I have visited another dentist that is highly recommended. Such a fantastic dentist and the way he explained everything was brilliant and made few at ease. He said what I have is a fibrous epulis. The root canal he said is fine but there is a large deep cavity on the adjacent tooth and that’s the issue. Food/debris has got stuck in there and caused the issue. His plan is to do a deep filling and then deep clean the area and stop food debris getting stuck again. He is hopefully that once sorted my body might be able to correct the issue and see it shrink. If not he will refer me to a periodontist who will remove it. They have such a person at the practice so I don’t have to go to hospital if I would rather they do it. Obviously there is a cost to go private but I feel more confident with them.\nHe himself has worked at the local dental hospital and has won awards for his work and he said this is quite a common thing they see up there.

He said he will give splint after PT.\nI have ear pain,jaw pain under ear where the lower jaw ends, pain on top side of the head above the ear, neck pain(only right side and it's very painful). My Dr did see a small lump on side of the neck and my neck is swollen a little.\nI have continuous sore pain. It's like sore scratching/burning pain on side of the neck, lower jaw under the ear, inside the ear and top right of the head(one spot above the ear).I hear some soft music pitch, ringing in my ear at times during the day and while lying down.\nIt hurts to touch spots under the ear, side of the neck and on one spot on top right side of the head. Neck and jaw are mildly swollen. Severe pain in the lower jaw under ear and side of the neck. It hurts to touch. I feel like something stuck in the throat constantly. I see in Google that something stuck in the throat symptoms comes under TMJD too. So, I am not sure if the neck pain and swelling(lump) comes under TMJD or eagle syndrome? Any thoughts?\n\nI had another dentist tele visit,he said might be ES and my symptoms looks like that. He saw the x-rays. I am not sure if I have eagle syndrome. Whom to consult further for this. Does my pan xray show eagle syndrome? Whom to consult further to know if it's a eagle syndrome. I have started PT for tmjd.\nAnyone had this before? Any inputs please. Have you researched it?

I did see an Endodontist and he could see small fracture lines and he said crown could help. They did cold spray test and I could feel soreness for about 20seconds on that tooth after the spray. During bite test, I feel pain and sensitivity to bite on one spot on that tooth.not while release.So, the Endodontist said I can go for RCT with a crown after that.\nYesterday, the Endodontist called me to check if I am ready for RCT. I did asked him that if my symptoms are from tooth crack or tmjd.  He said he is not sure. I want to treat the one which is causing these symptoms. So I asked him if these symptoms from the tooth crack , I will do RCT immediately. I don't know if it's from tmjd or crack.  The reply as it's like a trial and error. \nI was totally disappointed.

Luke W: Thankyou for the reply, unfortunately I’m currently not with a dentist as I’m unemployed and no one in my area is taking on NHS patients, so I had to have this tooth removed through the 111 emergency service. So I don’t have a dentist to get it checked. I assume il have to just wait until I can be seen via NHS? Unless you can recommend something else ? The dentist did actually say I needed the two teeth on either side of the extraction also removed eventually. Many thanks Dr M: Good day\n\nTry and keep the area as clean as possible by rinsing with luke-warm salt water. If you notice an increase in pain and if a swelling begins to develop, it might be a good idea to go to your local clinic/hospital to at least get some antibiotics, if you can't get to a dentist.\nIf the pain doesn't increase and everything seems normal, at least try and make an appointment with a dentist as soon as it is possible for you. It is never a good idea to have severely rotten teeth in your mouth, since this can put pressure on your immune system, in a time where you might need it to combat Covid. Luke W: Ok, thanks for the information. Once dentists can start seeing new patients again Il have to get the dental work I need done. It’s now day 5 and the site has definitely cleaned up, still not sure if I will have dry socket as the hole does look relatively empty, the gums are still soar and I am having to take 4-6 ibuprofen a day to ease the pain but I have no swelling or major pain, is it possible to get dry socket after 5 days ? And also, how long does dry socket roughly last? Thanks for your responses, been very helpful. Many thanks. Luke W: I also have dental issues on the other side top and bottom, the main pain being the bottom. It’s only painfull if I eat on that side or when I lie down at night, just wondering if they would need to be extracted also or I could get them filled in? Dr M: It is difficult to give an opinion on that without a proper x-ray to evaluate the extent of the decay. It is possible that they might be able to save the teeth with root canal treatments, but this should rather be discussed with your treating dentist. A full evaluation of your entire mouth is needed, since I would not consider certain treatments, if the rest of your mouth is in a poor condition. Luke W: Thanks for the advice, much appreciated. Could you tell me if I tooth extraction site looks normal ? It’s been almost 2 months now and it still hasn’t fully sealed up, is that normal ? Thanks. Dr M: Good day\n\nThe area looks like it is healing nicely, but I am still worried about the teeth on opposite sides of the hole. These also need to be assessed, because if left untreated, it could also lead to abscess formation and eventual tooth loss. Luke W: Thanks for the feedback, the only issue I have is I am currently unemployed and no dentists in my area are taking on NHS patients, do you recommend anything or is it just the waiting game ? Many thanks. Dr M: You can try and keep the area as clean as possible, but the risk is high that those teeth can become infected, without proper treatment. Luke W: Is it a option to ring 111 and get emergency treatment ? Fillings or tooth extraction ? Otherwise il have to wait until work picks back up due to covid and then get it done privately?

Ty Dr M: Good day\n\nUsually I advise patients to stick to a soft diet for the first 3-5 days, and to try and keep most of the food away from the sockets as much as possible. I also advise them to rinse with luke-warm salt water, starting from the next day, 3 times a day, for 5-7 days. Rinse very gently to avoid disturbing the blood clot.\nSometimes the sockets become painful after 3-5 days.

I just had the abutments done and the molar one is around 5mm above the gumline but the canine one varies from 2 - 3mm in places, as this is the biting tooth shouldn't there be more exposure as the canine will take the brunt of the pressure.\n\nI read \" when the height of the implant abutment is less than 5 mm, the diameter of the implant abutment is more critical to improve cement retention or resistance. A customized abutment, larger in diameter than the stock abutment, may be necessary to retain the restoration. In these instances, additional abutment height not only increases the surface area but also results in increased retention and resistance form. The longer axial walls allow for more compressive and tensile force, rather than damaging shear stress\"\n\nI have asked the practice but I would like a second opinion,\n\nThanks Dr M: Good day\n\nI am no implant specialist, but there are a lot of factors that play a role. Firstly the height can be influenced by the amount of space available. If the interocclusal space is not sufficient, a shorter abutment might be chosen. It can also be that 2 different types of implants were chosen, based on the amount of bone present as well as the distance to other important anatomical structures.\nIs the implant crown, screw or cement retained? A longer bridge span, might also influence the height, since a longer span, could exert forces on a longer abutment, that could result in fracture of the abutment.\n\nIn the end, you have to work with what you have."

This shift could lead to you grinding your teeth, leading to the jaw ache, and it could be more specific to one side.\nI would still go to your dentist, just to take a x-ray, to rule out any other possible causes.

My dentist suggested surgery on both sides.\nDoes somebody have a second opinion on what that could be?\nThank you for your response Dr M: Good day\n\nOn your panoramic radio-graph it looks like you have abscesses or infections around the roots of your front teeth. This can sometimes happen, when crown preparations are made on vital teeth. Sometimes it is not immediately painful, but the pain can flare up at any stage. During the crown preparations, the tooth is cut smaller and the nerve can be damaged. This is always a risk. These teeth might require root canal treatments to be done-not necessarily surgery. This would be done through the existing crowns. The one tooth ( right front tooth in the mid-line) already has a root canal treatment performed on it, with a post( pin ) and crown. In this case, an apicetomy or surgery where they cut off the root tip, might be required, but only if a root canal re-treatment can't be performed.\nIt is important to note, that when root canal treatments are done through existing crowns, there is always a risk that the crowns can become damage or loose,  and then new crowns might have to be made.\n\nHope this helps Vladimir: This makes perfect sense to me, thank you for your amazing answer"

This usually happens 3-5 days after an extraction and is most common in the lower jaw, due to food and other particles going into the socket area as we eat.

    "title": "Dental treatment second opinion",
    "dialogue": "jen9617: I would like a second opinion about the dental treatment recommended to me and the care I received. Last year, I went to a dentist because I had an abscessed tooth. I was given amoxicillin to take for 1 week, then I received a root canal. The amoxicillin didn't cure the infection, but I was told the root canal would get rid of the infection. A couple of months after the root canal, I received a permanent dental crown. The dentist did not do an x-ray before placing the permanent crown to see if the root canal had removed the infection. The crown was also poorly fitted. I had it adjusted twice, but it still uncomfortable and made my gums more inflamed. I requested for the crown to be removed and get a new crown. I was told that the infection is still there and that I need a root canal retreatment before I can get a new crown. I spoke with a family friend who is a dentist and was told that I was not given proper care. I was told that after I took the amoxicillin, the dentist should have placed an antibiotic into the tooth to remove the infection. I was told that the dentist should have done an x-ray to determine if the antibiotic was working before doing the root canal procedure. I was also told that the dentist should have made sure that the infection was completely cured before placing the permanent crown. I was also told that taking another round of amoxicillin and placing an antibiotic into the infected tooth could still cure the infection and that I may not need the root canal retreatment. Is this information correct? Did I receive improper care? If so, what recourse do I have for the poor treatment I received? Dr M: Good day,\n\nIt does sound like the treatment you received was not 100%. Usually a follow-up x-ray is indicated to ensure that the root canal was successful. During the treatment, a paste that also has anti-microbial properties is places into the canals, in order to assist with the killing of bacteria inside the tooth. Sometimes an additional antibiotic is also given with amoxicillin, that works on the anaerobic bacteria, which also\nneeds to be killed. This entire process should have been explained to you, since this is part of informed consent. \nThere are however a lot of other reasons that could also have led to the root canal treatment not clearing up the infection, such as the roots being short filled, canals being missed etc. This could be established with a good post-op radio-graph, and then this should also be attended to before a crown is placed on the tooth. After a crown is placed, it is then also important to take a post-op radio-graph of this procedure to ensure accurate fit and seal, as well as that no excess cement was left behind, that could cause inflammation and ultimately failure of the entire treatment.\nYou can try another round of antibiotics and then see if this helps, but ultimately I would suggest seeking a second opinion from another dentist, to evaluate the root canal, as well as the crown that was placed.\nThe steps that the dentist followed does not sound like good common practice, and it doesn't sound like you were informed of all the risks and steps of the treatment that was done. You can report the dentist to the associated health/dentist council or body that is present in your country and with whom he should be registered and then they could investigate to see if you have a case for malpractice or not."

Since my issue doesn't get any definite answer yet, I am going for different doctors to get proper diagnosis. \n\nAnd got another question doctor. \nI have lower jaw pain under the ear with swelling for past 2 months. Does it indicate some issue in the parotid gland? How to know if any issue or swelling ,pain causing from those glands? Who can diagnose that?and what imaging is required?I have taken pan, cbct in my OMFS office. But he didn't say anything about parotid  gland. I didn't ask him too. I just learned about it now. So, I can't go back to his office again to ask this. \n\nHow to know if it's from parotid gland? Dr M: Good day,\n\nI suggest bringing up your parotid gland question during your next consultation. Most likely the CT scan would have given an indication if additional tests are needed in order to test the parotid gland for any pathology or saliva related issue. \nDo you have any radio-graphs or CT-scans that you might attach?\nDifficult to give an opinion without more information on the issue.

They're planning to remove all of it with a margin of healthy tissue in the next couple weeks. Since then, I've been obsessing over my tongue and wanted to see if it appears normal? I assume the oral surgeon and ENT would have noticed this if it wasn't, but still, I'm worrying. Does that look normal or should I bring it up to the ENT when they're removing the dysplasia? Thanks! Dr M: Good day\n\nFirstly dysplasia ( depending on severity ) is usually a pre-malignant type of lesion and needs to be removed fully, since this can be a pre-cursor to possible oral cancer, especially in the high risk area of the ventral surface of the tongue.\nThe fact that they are planning a excisional biopsy means that they DID ALREADY notice the lesion and that is why they are planning the surgery. An oral surgeon is usually the type of specialist that deals with this."

It was a rather large hole and my roots are known for being enormous on my molars.\n\nNow to today, the wisdom tooth has made GREAT strides in just one week and is appearing quite rapidly.

He makes no promise it will last, but the price is very low.........\nBefore an implant, I want to try anything that might work.\nIs it worth a try or is it a waste of time?  Maybe the post needs to be long?\nMaybe after 5 years since last crown, decay has created more space under the crown?\nIt's been 2 months since it broke off.  x-ray is from a month ago.\n\nI did not understand that the cement within the post held the crown in place.\nI thought it was the bone structure above the gum line.\nThere was only a thin bone shard was above the gum line when attached 5 years ago, and that now has broken off with the crown.\n\nThe crown fell out 2 month ago.\nI discovered it stayed in place without cement.\nAfter 2 weeks the post broke.   Maybe using it without cement damaged the post.\n\nCREATIVE REMOVABLE WINGED CROWN \nAlternatively, what if a no-post crown is made with wings on the backside with a snug fit on teeth #19 and #21? \nSince my old crown stayed in place with no cement unless hard bread stuck to it, a crown designed with more contact points should with ease.\n#20 gets more natural side support than any other tooth.\nI have heard this idea would work better in acrylic than porcelain if using dental cement.\n\nI have heard the point against this idea, that anaerobic bacteria would accumulate inside the wings and teeth 19 and 21. \nNo solution is perfect.\nWould temp dental cement fill this space so the bacteria would not get in?\nI could remove this every week or so and give a complete cleaning.\nAny decay would be slow, and if idea doesn't work then at least I tried.\nINVENT A FLUORIDE IMPREGNATED DENTAL CEMENT TO KILL THE BACTERIA TRAPPED IN THERE HAHA. \n\nI have heard that the 'circular motion' of chewing would not keep it in place.\nBackward is the only direction it could possibly fall.  (The wings stop it falling forward.)\n\nI have heard that it would 'irritate the gums' but I don't understand how it would anymore than the original crown since both would sit atop the gum.\n\nIdeas with a 30% chance of success are worth trying before an implant.\nSome dentists say a Maryland bridge won't work on tooth #20 and others say it will.\n\nThanks so much for helping with creative solutions before an implant! Dr M: Good day\n\nWhen looking at the radio-graph it seems that the above mentioned tooth is already broken down to about bone level. There is a small chance the the remaining tooth structure that is left, might already be compromised due to a previously loose crown. If this is the case, you have to clean the tooth until sound structure is met, and this can lead to the tooth structure being below bone level, which is no longer restorable with conventional methods. There would also be a serious lack of Ferrule effect, which would most likely mean the crown would not be stable and most likely either leak or come loose again in the future.\nIn my opinion, it would be best to rather go for an extraction of the relevant tooth with immediate implant placement in the socket. In the long term, this would be a better solution.\nAs for your option 2, I would not recommend this, since firstly you have to drill on adjacent vital or healthy teeth in order to create space for the clasps. This could lead to nerve damage on those teeth. \nSecondly leakage might occur with bacteria leaking into the open root canal, resulting in abscess formation. \nAnd with the temp dental cement, it might result in additional tooth structure loss as it comes loose, resulting in too little tooth structure left to restore again, as mentioned above.\n\nIn my humble opinion, I would rather opt for something that is more long term. It is not good to go for a cheap temporary option, that might lead to more problems later, and then end up compromising the area for future implant placement.\nIf price is an issue, and there is other teeth also missing in the lower arch, maybe consider a removable partial denture.\n\nKind regards honestdoc: I agree with Dr. M.   Since the retained root is contaminated with oral fluids, it is best to remove it as soon as you can.  Implants are elective so you can get by without it.  The back molar may tip slightly forward until it bites stable against the top teeth reducing the space slightly.  Usually people won't notice that particular gap during normal interaction unless you point it out to them.  You may get food stuck in-between and many times if the undercuts are not significant, your cheek and tongue can remove most debris.  I would avoid a bridge if possible due to the need to drill on adjacent teeth (less drillin and less trauma the better)."

    "title": "Questions about a Bridge?",
    "dialogue": "CallMeSteven: I have a crown that over a two year period has loosened several times and has had to be re-cemented each time. The reason for this is that root is short, so the post (on the crown is short also). My dentist has suggested three options. A one tooth denture, a bridge or an implant.\nThe option I am considering for the future is a bridge. The teeth either side of the crown are also crowned, but fairly strong..my gums are also healthy.\nWhat is the exact procedure to make a bridge? Will the dentist have to remove the crowns either side of the weak crown to make a bridge? Also, are temporary crowns fitted whilst waiting for the bridge?\nMany thanks (links are welcome) honestdoc: With the choice of implant vs bridge, I would recommend implant because the dentist won't have to drill on adjacent teeth.  A bridge involves drilling or removing existing crowns on both sides of the missing area (abutment teeth).  Any drilling to teeth including removing the existing crown traumatizes the nerve (root canal) and weakens the teeth.  You may experience sensitivity after the drilling and many times intense enough to require root canal treatment which further weakens the abutment bridge. CallMeSteven: Many thanks."

I had one made after impressions made of  lower teeth. Are you meant to also wear one on the upper teeth too?  I have a lighter one for upper deck  but don’t use it. How do you sleep with two in? Impossible? I tried again to sleep with lower hard  one last night but can’t sleep with it. I also had a few molars out due to decay and one cracking on a nut shell in food. After teeth removal do you need to have new guard made? I heard you can get cones put in ears to stop you grinding rather like hearing aids. Do they work?  does hypnosis work? What causes the grinding? Is it anxiety? Stress? Dr M: Good day\n\nGrinding or bruxism can have a lot of causes. Some are related to stress, some can be related to a pre-existing malocclusion, previous dental restorations that lead to a malocclusion, or even to a possible TMJ disorder. It is difficult to pin point an exact cause, since a lot of investigations are needed.\nMouth guards need to be a certain thickness in order to achieve the desired outcome, and also needs to be replaced every 2 years or so, depending on how badly you grind your teeth. Usually only one is needed and patients often feel some discomfort with the bottom one. \nI would suggest getting a new bite plate made, of adequate thickness, for the top and then go back to your dentist to adjust it a little if too uncomfortable. If the grinding does not cease or if the bite plate does not alleviate your symptoms, it might be necessary to go and see a TMJ specialist, which will then do further investigations in order to see what can be done. Sometimes additional medication is required with physiotherapy of associated muscles. Sometimes there can be a psychological factor that needs to be addressed. And in extreme cases, surgery  can be a solution.\nBut this will be for a specialist to decide.\n\nHope this helps a little.

    "title": "Gum disease or infection?",
    "dialogue": "Minionfan: I suffer from anxiety and during lock down my anxiety has grown. I have anxiety over my teeth that comes and goes and recently it's been very bad.\n\nI went to a new hygienist and dentist 2 weeks ago and while they say I have \"historical gum disease\" in some of my back teeth\" they both said it isn't a problem at the moment. There was no bleeding on probing and my pockets were between 0 and 3. I brush twice, floss once or twice everyday and use mouthwash daily and saltwater rinses a few times a week.\n\nHowever, my back left wisdom tooth had to be removed about 2 months ago as it had severe bone loss. The hygienist told me that sometimes the wisdom teeth don't have as much bone as other teeth, is this right?!\n\nAlso the 2nd molar next to that wisdom tooth (that's now been extracted) has a lot of gum recession and the dentist said it could be due to the tooth having a deep filling.\n\nMy teeth also are a bit misaligned and I clench/grind my teeth often, especially when i'm stressed (I'm trying to stop this when I become aware of doing it).\n\nI had an examination and x rays taken at the dentist (but don't have access to them).\n\nI'm worried about the gum recession though and not sure why it is happening. I'm so concerned that every time I brush/floss (use interdental brushes), that I think I see bits of 'gum' that I spit out. Even though I actually can't be sure that I'm right and it isn't just bits of food from what I've eaten.\n\nCould I have an infection or problem under the filling or could I still have active gum disease now?\n\nMy dentist was happy enough to give me another appointment in 6 months and not sooner.... Dr M: Good day\n\nIt is difficult to give an exact opinion, due to a lack of information---no x-rays or photos etc.\nUsually when you floss, it is bits of food that comes out. You won't floss pieces of your gums out.\nIt is possible that the bone around your upper wisdom tooth, might not have been sufficient. Again difficult to say without an x-ray. Because these areas are usually difficult to keep clean, it is also possible that existing calculus in this area, could have lead to localized recession and bone loss.\nWhen we extract a tooth, the bone in that area gets resorbed over time and the level of bone ( horizontal and vertical ) is also affected. This could lead to some bone loss around the 2nd molar, especially if it was a traumatic extraction.\nIf you are worried, you are also more than welcome to get a 2nd opinion from another dentist. Especially if you are worried about recession in additional areas.\n\nJust as a side note--you should have access to your own x-rays and records. A dentist is not allowed to keep it from you. Ask for a copy.\n\nHope this helps! Minionfan: Thank you for your reply and I understand difficulty of replying without photos and x rays. It's extremely difficult to get photos of the area unfortunately.\n\nThe extraction wasn't traumatic, it took about 10 or so minutes to do and I have had no problems with the site since then either.\n\nI get very anxious and paranoid when it comes to my teeth so I may be over worrying. I have another hygiene appointment in a couple of weeks to do a very thorough assessment, I'll wait until then and see what the hygienist says and go from there.\n\nMy main worry now is that maybe I need a root canal and not the deep filling in the second molar....I can eat normally, don't have any pain when I chew on it and don't have particular sensitivity to heat or cold but I can 'feel' that area. It's not painful as such, just that I know it's there. Any ideas?!\n\nThe dentist I saw said it was probably because of the deep filling that I can feel it. Dr M: It might be a good idea to check your occlusion on that tooth as well. Sometimes if you bite on a tooth that is a little too \" high \", it might cause you to \" feel \" that specific area.\nAsk your dentist to adjust any high spots and then feel if it makes a difference.

    "dialogue": "woot5k: Okay, so let me preface this by saying I'm 25 years old and yesterday I had my first ever tooth extracted because of an old filling that fell out a year ago that I never took care of like a dummy. So here's where I need some help and guidance from individuals who might know a lot more than me. I had my tooth removed using what they called a \"simple extraction\" I believe yesterday at 7pm, it's now 6pm(EST) the next day.\n\nI'm absolutely beyond a doubt petrified of getting a \"dry socket\". I made the stupid mistake of looking online and my fears have just arose even more. So I had the gauze on it from about 8pm when they finished until about 5am when I finally was able to get tired enough to fall asleep(I did not sleep with the gauze in) and today I haven't put the gauze in my mouth at all. I called the dentistry because I have been terrified to even think about eating anything or drink anything and they advised me to eat super soft foods and then do a salt-water rinse afterwards(but not use my mouth muscles, just move my head around to flush the water around then just let it drop out of my mouth, which I did.) I just ate some mashed potatoes very slowly and then did the suggested salt-water rinse as carefully as I could.\n\nI also tried using a green tea bag on my extraction site a little as well, for about 40 or 50 minutes before switching back to the gauze because I read online it can help the healing process. I didn't have too much blood overall honestly either, it was a little bad at first but by the time I took it out to go to bed there wasn't too much blood at all, just a small amount around and a little more in the extraction site itself.\n\nMy extraction site doesn't hurt too bad either, a minor shooting pain here and there and a somewhat constant ache occasionally but surprisingly not that bad at all. They prescribed me pain medication for it but I honestly haven't even taken it because it doesn't hurt that terribly, so I'm hoping that's a good sign?\n\nI just can't shake the feeling of absolute DREAD about getting the extremely painful \"dry socket\". I haven't been spitting, smoking(I'm not a smoker), or sucking on any kind of straws but I'm still horrified. I just need some reassurance I guess from professionals. Any guidance or reassurance would be extremely appreciated. Dr M: Good day,\n\nIt seems like everything is going well post-operatively. Normally a dry-socket will only appear after days 3-4. If you get beyond this without any pain or swelling, you should be fine.\nContinue to rinse with luke-warm saltwater, gently, after every meal. This keeps the area clean. \nDon't fiddle with the socket too much. We want a healthy blood clot to form so that the socket can heal.\nTry and eat softer foods and try and keep it on the other side.\nAnd most importantly, relax."

    "dialogue": "oldcodger: On Saturday I was eating a soft cheese biscuit and there was a big crunch in my mouth, I spat out the contents of my mouth but there didn’t appear to be any solids.  Afterwards, chewing on the right side of my mouth became uncomfortable, so I just chewed on the left side.  On Monday, a filling that has a minimum thickness of 1.5 mm (measured using a vernier), presumably covering the whole of the top of a tooth appeared in my mouth.  Having felt around with my finger, I think that it was the top of the wisdom tooth, from which a splinter at the side came away 6 months ago.  The tooth next to that wisdom has been extracted and the next tooth appears to be loose or cracked too; all after eating a soft cheese biscuit!  \n\nI am not in any pain, but it is tender to eat on the right side of my mouth, but I can eat on the left side of the mouth without any discomfort.  I clean my teeth with an electric toothbrush after eating porridge in the morning, and since the weekend I have washed my mouth out with Corsodyl Mouthwash before going to bed.  I intend to use the mouthwash after lunch, stop eating biscuits, as the bits tend to float about in my mouth, and not have anything sweet like jam or fruit drink.\n\nTomorrow I expect to receive a bottle of Dentogen containing 20% Clove oil:-\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAmazon.co.uk\n\t\t\n\n\nThis states to apply with a “cottonwool bud. Repeat after 20 minutes and then every 2 hours if necessary.”\n\nFor the last 2 months I have been self isolating because I am a pensioner and I have breathing problems, and although my useless Doctor has not said that I am at risk, I am concerned about my ability to survive a Covid attack!  From Monday 15 June, my dentist started to see only patients that were in pain.  Hence, because of the covid and that I have no pain at the moment, I have been reluctant to contact the dentist, however, today I phoned 10 mins after opening and got cut off.\n\nConsequently, can anyone please advise how often I should use Corsodyl Mouthwash and Dentogen, and which would be most effective in staving off toothache?  Additionally, at what point should I make more of an effort to see a dentist to prevent a serious infection in my jaw?\n\n\nNote, in the distant past I had a temporary filling when on holiday, which I think was later crowned, where the root was completely dead as the dentist was able to drill into it without me feeling anything.  They say “where there’s no sense, there’s no feeling” Dr M: Good day\nCorsodyl mouthwash should not be used for longer than 2-4 weeks at a time, since it can cause staining on your teeth.\nDentogen is also just treating the pain, but not the cause of the pain.\nMy advice would be to phone your dentist again, and see if you can make an appointment. A broken tooth, can lead to abscess formation if left untreated. If  left for too long, the tooth that could have otherwise been saved, could lead to the loss of the tooth.\nMost dental practices that are open at this stage, have put certain safety measures in place to protect you from possible Covid-19 exposure. oldcodger: Thanks for your reply Dr M, I thought that I would see how things go for a week and assess the situation before replying.\n\nBecause of your reply, I stopped taking the Dentogen and consequently I only took it for 3 days prior to your reply. \n\nAs I said, a filling that covered the whole of the top of a wisdom tooth has come away.  When brushing with my Oral B electric toothbrush, I can brush the whole of the wisdom tooth because the tooth adjacent to it has been extracted and there is no pain, maybe a slight soreness afterwards.  The next tooth along is the other troublesome one and I believe that a slither has formed on the outside corner nearest the wisdom tooth because sometimes I can feel the slither move, but again no pain.   Note, last December a “splinter” of tooth 0.5 to 1 mm across, formed on the same wisdom tooth and my Dentist cut it off at the gum line, again I had no pain, maybe it was just a bit sore.   Currently, I have not had any real pain, just some slight soreness sometimes or a dull ache after waking or brushing my teeth, or occasionally after eating, but generally it soon disappears.  I can comfortably chew on the other side of my mouth.  Note, many years ago my Dentist suggested that I may grind my teeth in my sleep, so maybe that is why there is soreness on waking.\n\nSince your reply I have been brushing my teeth after breakfast, and applying the Corsodyl mouthwash for a minute before I go to bed, and occasionally after lunch if it is a bit sore, and the soreness soon disappears.  After lunch I usually wash my mouth out with water too.  When I feel soreness, it seems to be in the corner of my mouth by my wisdom tooth and not the tooth with the slither, but I’m not 100% sure.\n\nI am in the UK, and a neighbour has a friend who is a dental nurse, said that as my dental surgery has refused to see me because of my age and the possibility of getting an infection, Dental Hubs have been set up to attend to people like me.  However, because I am slightly out of breath most of the time, I am concerned about my ability to survive covid, so I am reluctant to seek a suitable Dentist at this time.  I am self isolating and have not been out for 2.5 months.  Note, last week that dental nurse said that her surgery had not opened for business yet, so there may be quite a demand for treatment by people in a far worse condition than myself.   Providing my situation does not get any worse, I am tempted to wait a week or two before seeking treatment, when hopefully the covid will have died down even more.\n\nI would grateful for any further advice? Dr M: Good day,\n\nIf the pain is manageable and you don't experience any swelling, it should be fine to wait for about 2 weeks until you can see a dentist. oldcodger: Thanks Doctor for your swift reply."

    "dialogue": "Fedja007: Good afternoon,\n\nI have a very \"broad\" question in regards to something I found last night while checking my teeth. On the back of one of my upper incisors, I found a grey mass on it.\n\nI don't believe it's cavity, since: a) it's not black, as all my other cavities have been; and b) it's an actual mass; I can feel it with my fingers. It's hard and cannot be scratched off. It doesn't hurt and it's found on the bottom of the tooth itself.\n\nWhat might this be? I know that the possibilities might be endless in a way, and I'm going to see my dentist on Monday. But I'm kind of really worried, because it's - well - a tooth that is on such a visible place and I'd hate seeing it crumble. I guess I just need to know what it might be.\nI'm attaching a very low-quality picture (my phone camera sucks), so you can see it. It's on the right side, but it seems as if something similar is forming on the left.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\nThank you so much to whoever answers. honestdoc: From the visuals, it does not appear to be any cavities, just staining.  The dentists will need to take x-rays to check in-between your teeth and any internal structures that are not visible to clear of any cavities. Dr M: Good day,\n\nFrom the picture I think you might also be referring to what we sometimes call a Talon cusp, which is a protuberance of enamel and dentin on the inside aspect of your tooth, which is most likely also why you are saying that it feels hard. This is normal anatomy in certain individuals. ( please be advised my opinion is based on your photo only ). To rule out any underlying decay, I agree with Honestdoc to have a dentist examine the teeth with a x-ray."

Dr M: Good day,\n\nThe ventral surface of the tongue and floor of the mouth are high risk areas for a range of potentially dangerous disorders. My opinion is to rather have the area examined by an oral surgeon. He will then decide if a biopsy is necessary i.e. where they cut a small piece of the affected area and send the piece for lab tests.\nThis will rule out anything ominous and give you piece of mind.\nIf it is not painful and not enlarging, it can wait, but to be on the safe side, don't postpone it for too long.\n\nHope this helps"

I went to the dentist, she cleaned the area, said there was no infection and said it should return to normal within 2 weeks. I was told the reason it looked raised is because the gum had detached from the tooth but that it will re attach.\n\nHowever, despite trying to keep it clean, avoiding eating with it and using corsodyl mouth wash, it hasn't returned to normal. I still feel sharp sensitivity pains and the gum is still raised. I saw another dentist 2 days ago who told me the same thing, gave me a mouthwash called curaprox perio plus to use and said the gum should re attach itself and I'll be fine in 2 weeks.\n\nThe thing is, it's been 5 weeks and it hasn't re attached.

I think you're talking about the last molar as the wisdom tooth is not filled.    If you have a root canal you should ideally have the tooth crowned as the treatment makes the enamel more brittle ( so more likely to crack and break).  \n\nIf it breaks then it's down to luck whether you can save the tooth.

It's pretty important to get it looked at otherwise you could end up with an infection on surrounding teeth. MattKW: It is probably essential to have it removed because usually the cracks are very deep, and it is only a matter of time before you develop a gum infection. at least go and get an Xray and opinion. It won't affect the adjacent teeth. Busybee: Infections can spread to the jaw and even the brain if ignored.

Busybee: I would see how you feel if you have it removed.  You might feel it's ok to just leave a gap.    If you have a bridge you have to crown the other teeth.      Plus you have to keep it & the crowns really clean with hygiene appointments.   The other risk is that the surrounding teeth may not be strong enough.  Particularly as one is a wisdom tooth.   If you don't want to spend too much you could always just get a plate for eating.  Lots of people around the world use removable plates for eating etc.    At least that way you don't have to drill into the surrounding teeth.

To do a fixed bridge you have the surrounding teeth crowned.   That's why it's so expensive.    Given your history and financial situation a plate would be a good option, if you can get used to it.   It's not like you fix a bridge and it's forever.  The hygiene appointments & maintenance aside, it will need to be replaced after so many years.   They do the hard sell with bridges and implants but plates are used successfully by many on a budget.  They do put pressure on surrounding teeth and tissue but it's like any prosthetic.

My dentist said that it is normal sensitivity in the tooth, but it was not the problem. After a month I insisted a x-ray. The photo attached shown an other cavity in my penultimate molar. It was also filled, but sensitivity still exists 4 days after the intervetion. My dentist warned me that if the pain remain probaly root canal will be required, but I am not sure that this tooth is the problem. Can you help with advice? MattKW: Poor resolution X-ray. Looks like possible decay still under the filling in the last molar. Most likely reason is polymerisation shrinkage and weakened bonding of the composite. If it doesn't settle within 2 weeks post-op, I would either have it redone (in composite), or better still have it redone in amalgam. Composite fillings have a much, much higher rate of post-op sensitivity than amalgams. But that's not justification for a root canal; that's justification for reassessing what went wrong with the filling. Dr M: I agree with MattKW. The X-ray isn't to great, but I would also suggest observing the tooth for the next week or so. On the x-ray it also looks like there is either calculus or excess filling material? from a previous filling on the molar next to the last one. Right in between the teeth. In some cases this could cause chronic irritation of the gum in that area, which sometimes also leads to some confusion if the pain is from the tooth or the gum.\nA follow-up visit with a second better quality radiograph, as well as certain vitality tests, might give a better idea of what the problem might be. girginchev: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPoor resolution X-ray.

Dear Dr MattKW,\nDear Dr M,\nThank you very much for your fast response. I decided to take a new x-ray photo with a higher resolution, hoping that the problem could be seen better. As I mentioned, the cavity on the last molar (down) was done a month ago and on the penultimate molar - before 7 days. I still have irritation between the two teeth and sporadic pain. I will be grateful for your opinion again if it is necessary a root canal treatment on any of the two teeth and what could cause pain for so long.\nThank you in advance! Dr M: Good day,\n\nIt could be that the restoration on one or both teeth were also very close to the nerve, which could have cause pulpitis(inflammation of the nerve). It looks especially deep on the penultimate molar.\nI would suggest doing some pulp vitality tests at your dentist to determine the pulp status of the associated tooth. It might give a better idea if a root canal treatment is indicated on the specific tooth or not. MattKW: Replace the filling with amalgam."

    "dialogue": "sunlilly: Hi everyone,\n\nThank you so much for this forum. I am in some pain and don't know what to do.\n\nSo I have had teeth extracted before and never felt this kind of pain. \n\nHere's the story: The reason I had number 18 tooth extracted (second molar) was, because it was digging into my tongue and making my tongue swollen. The tooth itself was fine. No pain. There was no pain on the tongue either even though it was really swollen on that side. So I had no pain before my 18 tooth was pulled.\n\nHere's the kicker, the pain is not where the actual tooth was pulled so I know it's not dry socket or anything like that. There is no pain where the tooth was pulled what so ever, but everywhere around it is pain.  The bad pain I am experiencing is on the right side of my throat, under the right side of my tongue and more towards the front of my teeth. The pain feels like someone scratched in these areas to death, feels like freddy kuger scratched it up in there and the pain towards my right front teeth is a very sore pain. The motrin is easing the pain but I am not sure for how long. This is four days after tooth extraction.\n\nSo to recap, I had my number 18 tooth removed 4 days ago. I don't have my wisdom teeth anymore (been gone for 20 years). Number 19 and 20 have been extracted 10 years ago, never gave me any problems after they were extracted. So the pain is in my 22 tooth area. It's just so crazy to me that I feel the pain all the way up there when I don't have 18, 19, or 20 anymore. There is no pain where 19 and 20 use to be.  So the areas that I am feeling a lot of pain in are number 22/23 teeth, under my the right side of my tongue right where 18 was taken out, then the right side of my throat (which scares me), and near my ear area.\n\nI am really concerned. I don't have a fever. I don't notice any scratches but it's so hard to see inside of my mouth. Any ideas? Thank you so much for any help. I'm in a lot of pain. honestdoc: What you're experiencing is rare.  I'm not able to picture your problem.  Hopefully you can return for proper followup."

There was pain between it and the 1st molar next to it, which is gone since the extraction.\n\nI am on day 3, however my pain persists. It's an ache through my entire jaw, mainly on my canine tooth and my wisdom tooth. It mirrors on the upper jaw too (my teeth there are all healthy). Also sometimes it aches in my ear and behind the jaw (rarely). It's uncomfortable but not severe. It's the same kind of pain I had before.\n\nAs for the gum, I feel pressure in it, kinda like swelling or having food stuck, soreness when talking and right above the removed tooth pain when I press. \n\nI also have slightly raised body temperature since the tooth came out.\n\nIs this normal? Should I go to the ER? I am already on antibiotics and I will be visiting my dentist tomorrow anyway. I am very scared of infections honestdoc: Do you feel any swelling?

Had two or three days of pain from the tight crown, then pain subsided. Two months later, after start of coronavirus, I had tingling discomfort in the tooth. Dentist who was not attending prescribed amoxicillin 500mg tid for a week. Didn't solve the problem. Saw endodontist who was attending. He said root canal looked fine, gum around the tooth inflamed. Dentist remotely prescribed chlorhexedine rinse bid for two weeks, didn't solve the problem. Pain is not severe, doesn't require analgesic, but tooth is clearly not normal. Could it be from the snugness of the crown and if so can anything be done? MattKW: Sounds like root canal is fine or else the endodontist would've said so, and the tooth would be tender to biting pressures. If the gum is inflamed, it may be that the crown edges are too deep for the gums to tolerate, or that the crown edges don't fit well. Antibiotics are not indicated. Go back to dentist who made the crown. Get photos and show us.

The root canal failed and I was in too much pain they took the tooth out. \n\nThe other premolar was done too, went well, was pain free for few months. Around winter time I got a cold and after the cold it started hurting. They opened it but the pain just never went away. They tried to save it and I would have only pain in the gum for most of it but it seemed that it won't heal.\n\nIn march I was supposed to have it treated but dentists closed and I was told that unless it hurts actively to wait it out. It didn't hurt actively but my gum hurt between the two teeth and it was uncomfortable to eat. \n\nIt started hurting again and the dentist finally gave up, saying that we will take it out on Friday and he put me on antibiotics just in case.\n\nI am scared I waited too long with a chronic infection in my mouth for months. I am scared I will develop sepsis or meningitis when they take it out in couple days. Has anyone experienced anything like this with a chronic painful tooth canal?

    "title": "2 implant bridge vs 4 individual implants teeth 7-8-9-10",
    "dialogue": "j4kskateboarding: Hey you all, I'm currently faced with a hard decision and am seeking advice. After having my top four teeth removed 4 1/2 months ago I now have the option of having a 4 unit bridge supported by implanting 7 and 10 or individual implants placed for each missing tooth. Financial benefits aside I just want what's going to be best in the long run. My main concerns of the implanted bridge is bone loss in the space of 8 and 9. Another concern is the hollow feeling that having a bridge there may cause. What would you do? Any insight would be helpful as I gather information before making this decision, thanks in advance. \n\nAttached is an Xray from the beginning of January 2020 MattKW: For the moment, I'd suggest you simply get a partial denture while you spend time and effort on the other apparent decay in  your teeth.\nNotably: 4, 13, 14, 18, 20, 29, and 31. There may be more that are not easily visible on this OPG - you'd need bitewings. You may end up extracting more teeth.\nThen I'd get the wisdoms removed. \nThen come back to implants, maybe. j4kskateboarding: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFor the moment, I'd suggest you simply get a partial denture while you spend time and effort on the other apparent decay in  your teeth.\nNotably: 4, 13, 14, 18, 20, 29, and 31.

Thanks for the response MattKW. Ideally I was hoping to get it all done, including the cavities, in one pass and if any others did call for extractions than go for immediate implants on those as well. I understand it may take a number of sessions to get to all of them though unless not then I'd be willing to get it done, or at least in the shortest window possible. MattKW: Have you had bitewings and do you have a treatment plan organised to show us? j4kskateboarding: I do have some that were taken from the beginning of November 2019 attached here. As for a treatment plan I don't. These were taken only a few months after having 7-10 crowned and just about a week before having them unfortunately extracted. Its been a rough ride so far. The dentist that removed the crowns was different from the one who placed them. Just before the procedure puss came out from the top pallet of my mouth where he had stuck the needle. I don't think it was necessary to extract all four teeth as only one looked in bad enough condition but he left me with no other option. It was a very unfortunate turn of events for me and regret it deeply having had gone to that dentist. MattKW: How old are you? Early 20s? j4kskateboarding: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHow old are you? Early 20s? Yea sorry, forgot to mention my age. Actually late 20s, Im 29 now. I don't do drugs. I do eat a lot of fruit. I was given many rounds of antibiotics growing up and one big dose 5 years ago that nearly took me out. Since then have learned that a history of antibiotic use could lead to teeth decay which is why I mention it. I also neglected going to a dentist since I was about 14 until just recently in the past year when all this happened. I did have decay on 7 and 10 but as for 8 and 9 I believed were crowned at the dentists convenience but I learned to late when all this drove me to research on my own the different dental procedures. I wasn't even aware of what crowns were until midway into the process of getting my four front teeth ground down. I was expecting some composite fillings on 7 and 10 at the most.. but like I said, I learned to late. Now Im just trying to go about the rest wisely. I know there's still a lot ahead of me and I deal with depressing thoughts everyday since all of this. MattKW: Antibiotic use doesn't cause decay. The pattern I see in your teeth is probably sweet drinks (or lollies) and neglect. If you don't get your hygiene and diet in good shape, then you will waste your money on anything you do. Implants are not necessarily better than real teeth and will fail if your hygiene is poor. \nWhen I have a bit of time, I'll work you up a Treatment Plan (TP) as I see it with sequencing, but ignore the Item Codes (Australian). You really need to get a proper TP from your local dentist with costing. This is going to take you quite some time and expense, and a few unknowns with the more  severely damaged teeth. j4kskateboarding: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAntibiotic use doesn't cause decay.

I really appreciate you taking the time to elaborate. I feel your passion for dentistry and if you do find the time to, it would definitely be of use. I understand hygiene is important just as much for implant care. Ive always kept up with brushing at least twice a day, once upon rising and before sleep but hadn't kept up with flossing much. I just feel like maybe the health challenges I faced after taking that round of antibiotics (2g azithromycin) for an infection involving my bladder some years ago has to do with the cause because the teeth most affected are related to the urogenital, kidney, and bladder meridians according to the chart. Since then Ive adopted a raw food diet of solely vegetables and fruits that's helped me manage symptoms immensely but maybe not so much my teeth. Anyways thanks for all as I battle these issues. Much love. honestdoc: Urologists usually recommend acidic fluids like cranberry juice and supplements to maintain and prevent urinary problems.  Cranberry alone is too sour to ingest thus sugar is added to make it tolerable.  These combinations are very damaging to your teeth as Dr. MattKW mentioned.  I would recommend 5000 ppm fluoride supplementation to prevent further teeth deterioration. j4kskateboarding: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUrologists usually recommend acidic fluids like cranberry juice and supplements to maintain and prevent urinary problems.

A) to implant 8 and 9 with a bridge to 7 and 10 as I seen done in many videos done or B) implant 7 and 10 and go that route? Just asking for opinions, thanks. MattKW: It would largely depend upon bone thickness and the likely aesthetic result. I'd think it more likely to have implants at 8 and 9, then cantilever the (smaller) 7 and 10. j4kskateboarding: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIt would largely depend upon bone thickness and the likely aesthetic result.

Im thinking now either 7 and 10 with a bridge or 8 and 9 MattKW: No one would want to do 4 individual implants; that would be unnecessary and too troublesome. As I said earlier, you'll probably be better doing implants at 8 and 9 where there will be more bone."

Surely, these savings can be passed on to patients by giving compensation for lost hygienist appointments. MattKW: No, it's not some kind of windfall for dentists to close up shop and lay off staff.

Otherwise the precautions should be that they don't have a packed waiting room (social distancing), that they have at least alcohol rub for your hands (please don't touch armrests in waiting room), and that they perform only enough treatment to deal with your problem. If the tooth has to be drilled to relieve the abscess, they should ideally place a rubber dam to minimise the aerosol generated by the drill. I have not yet heard of a case of a dentist or their staff contracting COVID from a patient, maybe because we treat you all as bags of germs - ha! rogertb: Excellent and very reassuring Matt, I'll call the emergency number tonight ... I'll wear gloves and keep my mouth shut ... of course that's not an option. Stay safe."

Teeth do not whiten from brushing no matter how long or how hard you apply.  Try to gently floss and brush (massage) the red gums and allow it to heal.  If they continue to be red, it could be hormonal fluctuations or medication related.  Don't use mouth rinses because they could cause further (chemical) irritation.  Your teeth look fine, just need to watch the redness in the gums. Ingabella: But you said that my teeth look damaged  I‘ve been told I have nice teeth.

X-rays turned up no issues with the procedure.\n\nI don't always feel pain, but if I press on the tooth or if I have to \"tear\" into some food, I will feel some pain either immediately or afterwards.

MattKW: It would be interesting to know why the 50yo filling failed; often it's when part of the natural tooth breaks away and the filling loses grip. \nIs this dentist trying another amalgam, or a composite?\nAny Xrays to show us? dragon53: MattKW:\n\nI had two 50 year-old metal fillings, applied at the same time, come out within a few weeks of each other. The new dentist told me I'm grinding my teeth which is wearing the tooth down, so maybe that makes it difficult for the new fillings to stay bonded. As I posted earlier, a crown is the other alternative.\nThe dentist did two new fillings on other teeth, and they are fine. I just had the problem losing three new fillings on the same tooth.\nI'm curious if losing three new fillings is normal under the circumstances. MattKW: So it's a bonded composite? More likely to fail in a high-stress situation like a back molar. It may be that there isn't enough thickness to do either a composite or amalgam. For 2nd molars, I often go for a thin precious (high-gold) crown."

    "dialogue": "berkeleydiego: I am 38 years old and have a canine (#6) with \"a class II cervical invasive root resorption on the distal extending to the osseous level.\" Images and further context can be found in this endodontics consultation report \n\nI've sought the opinion of an endodontist and oral surgeon in addition to my general dentist. The only consensus among them is that I will need to have the tooth removed at some point in the future. Each of their opinions on what to do now differ. My dentist recommends root canal with crown and crown lengthening, and thinks my tooth will last 5-7 years that way. The endodontist recommends root canal and is confident he can seal with composite filling instead of crown and crown lengthening, but isn't really able to offer any expected timelines. The oral surgeon recommends extraction & implant. Any suggestions on which is the best course of action at this time? Thanks in advance berkeleydiego: Wrong link above. Sorry for the confusion. It doesn't seem like I can modify the original post, so here is the correct link to the consultation report:\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Drive: Sign-in\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nAccess Google Drive with a Google account (for personal use) or Google Workspace account (for business use).\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tdrive.google.com honestdoc: I think the need for crown lengthening depends on how accessible it is to restore the distal defect.  There is a minimal biologic width requirement of 3 mm from the border of the restoration to the bone level which is 1 mm sulcular depth, 1 mm connective tissue of the gums to the bone and 1 mm epithelial tissue.  Composites are not as bio-compatible under the gums so I recommend a strong glass ionomer (Fuji Equia) or bioactive material like Activa.  For long term, it is hard to predict the life span of compromised teeth.  If you grind and clench, you decrease its life exponentially.  I think it is wise to prepare for extraction and possible implant so any problems won't catch you by surprise financially and emotionally. berkeleydiego: Thanks for the reply @honestdoc . I interpret your reply as a recommendation to go with the root canal now, and that I should be prepared mentally for extraction at any time after. Is that correct? I'm having trouble understanding the the benefit of going through the hassle and expense of the root canal if the extraction & implant is inevitable. Are you able to explain why it makes sense to preserve the natural tooth as long as possible versus just proceeding with the implant now?\n\nFor what it's worth I do grind and clench at night, but I have a nightguard \n\nThanks again very much. honestdoc: Are you having pain and or swelling?  If your tooth tests vital, then you don't need a root canal.  However, you may need it in the future or after the restoration.  If the tooth tests vital with no symptoms, do the restoration first.  After the restoration is satisfactory, monitor for future root canal.  If further damage occurs and you develop symptoms, you may consider extraction instead of root canal and consider implant.  Consider the conservative and least traumatic options first. MattKW: Crown lengthening will also adversely affect the adjacent premolar. Don't take it down with the canine. Do minimal treatment for the canine and prepare for eventual extraction. berkeleydiego: Thanks again @honestdoc . I had some pain before my general dentist cleaned out the decay and came across the resorption, at which point she put in a temporary filling. Currently there is no spontaneous pain, but there's is a bit of sensitivity to cold temperatures and it does hurt when I use my electric toothbrush in the rear of that tooth. Do you think that warrants root canal?\n\nIf I go the route of restoration, do you think there's a reasonable chance that the tooth could last the rest of my life? If that's the case it makes more sense to me to try the conservative approach first. So far I've gotten the impression that there's pretty much no chance of it lasting my lifetime, but I would like to learn otherwise if that's not true berkeleydiego: Thanks @MattKW for weighing in. I appreciate it. So you recommend going with a filling at this point to see if that's successful? Do you think there's a reasonable chance I may be able to keep the tooth the rest of my life? Thanks again MattKW: I would suggest you only try a glass ionomer. There is no benefit in using a composite. Ultimately, I think that tooth is doomed. berkeleydiego: Thanks @MattKW . So do you think the root canal is unnecessary at this point despite the sensitivity to temperature and the pain (albeit quite tolerable) when using my electric toothbrush in the rear of that tooth? Do you have any sense how much time I might be able to buy for the tooth if I end up with a glass ionomer filling? Thanks again MattKW: Root canal if the pain is intolerable. No idea how long that tooth will last. berkeleydiego: @MattKW and @honestdoc , the more I think about it I'm not sure I understand the point of bothering with the restoration if extraction is ultimately inevitable. Seems like I would just be throwing money away on a temporary restoration (not to mention an uncomfortable visit in the dentist chair) as opposed to just getting the extraction and implant done and over with.Are you able to help me understand your reasoning for pursuing the restoration even though it's just temporary?  I'm guessing I'm missing something. Thanks again very much honestdoc: If it was my tooth, I would go for the filling.  After the filling, if I have no pain, swelling, or problems functioning, I would just leave it alone.  If I develop pain (above 4-5/10 scale), swelling, any difficulties, I would like to re-evaluate with new x-rays and decide to pull it or do a root canal depending on how much damage.  Again I prefer the least traumatic option. berkeleydiego: Thanks for the reply @honestdoc . So does that mean you think there's a reasonable chance that the tooth may be able to last for the rest of my life after all? MattKW: Very unlikely. But maybe you'll get hit by a falling grand piano tomorrow and all your worries will be over. What I'm trying to say is - just get it filled, and wait and see. There is no definitive timeline to these things. honestdoc: Like Dr. MattKW mentioned, it's hard to predict the longevity of things especially teeth subjected to insane amounts of PSI & sheer pressures, mineral degrading acids, bone & gum deterioration, and neglect.  I would not lose sleep over it and just keep & maintain your teeth as long as possible.   I'll definitely worry about that grand piano falling on me every moment..."

I am wondering shouldn’t this have been, be, stitched??? Sorry horrible experience and I cannot live through any complications.\nI appreciate t he advice. honestdoc: Sorry for your traumatic experience.  Believe it or not your dentist did a good job.  Your case unfortunately can be hard for any dentist.   Bottom teeth are more difficult to anesthetize due to lower nerve anatomy and chronic infection makes it even harder.  Previous root canal treated teeth do not want come out and will break into many pieces.  You do not need a stitch there because the hole is closing with the blood clot.  Try taking Tylenol with ibuprofen to relieve pain and finish the Amox once you have started taking it.  If you haven't taken Amox and you have no swelling, then don't take it.  Taking antibiotics unnecessarily will lead to bacterial resistance. Kitcat: This is why I asked to be sedated. Hope it's better now"

I'm guessing it's only the part above the gumline that's fallen out. I have no pain as of now, but it's very unsettling. The tooth already had a root canal before the crown was placed. Will the dentist be able to build the tooth structure above the gumline and put the crown back there? Or will I need to have a new crown placed? Or maybe something else? Thanks in advance! MattKW: If it's sheared off at gum level, then it is probably doomed for an extraction. You can't put on a crown if there's nothing to hang it off. To even rebuild a structure above the gumline would be very high risk of failure, and I very rarely do it.

MattKW: Yes, but all the forces are then concentrated at the post in the middle, and they often fracture. The exceptions might be cast gold post-and-cores for molars, but rarely done because all the right factors have to be in place.Better to plan for an extraction, then either denture, bridge, or implant. sparta: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tYes, but all the forces are then concentrated at the post in the middle, and they often fracture.

MattKW: Can't tell for sure either. Some people get an amalgam \"tattoo\" if a filling gets pushed into the tissue which is sort of what your dentist is suggesting. Unfortunately that doesn't look a likely place for one, or the right appearance, but that's just an internet opinion. Good luck and let us know what they find out. honestdoc: It is very rare and the numbers are in your favor to have a lesion (in that location) that is sinister.  I think the most likely lesion is an amalgam \"tattoo\" like Dr. MattKW mentioned.  If so, it is harmless...I have it.  It should also show up on x-rays as white specks in the area.  In oral pathology, there is a saying \"when you hear hoof beats, think horses, not zebras.\"\n\nThe most common oral cancer is Squamous Cell Carcinoma especially in that location and your lesion does not look like it."

He's not a specialist in dental implants, he does like 2 implants per month and its fee is around £1800 for a straight forward case.\n - The other option is a implantologist that does much more implants, like 200 per year, during the last 10 years.

And it's a back tooth (one I would use a lot to chew) MattKW: Front ones are more difficult because the gum has to look exactly right. Straumann is the biggest manufacturer of implants and will be around for the rest of your life in case you need repair or replacement. It's worth the extra money. Maybe ask your regular dentist if he does Straumann too. When you get an implant, make sure to ask for ALL genuine Straumann parts and the scanned barcodes of ALL the parts to keep in your personal records. Sometimes the labs will use a cheaper knock-off, and that's bad."

If yes, would you recommend a RCT or extraction or other options? Also, please consider that my mom had radio-iodine treatment for thyroid cancer about 2.5 years ago, thus affecting her oral health.\n\nThanks. honestdoc: I think surgical extraction is more predictable.  I see a lot of structural damage and investing in root canal and crown has a high risk for failure.  However, with her history of radio-iodine treatment, ask the oncologist if dental extraction is OK.  There may be a risk for bone damage after surgical extraction due to compromised bone circulation (osteoradionecrosis of the jaw).  If the risk is too high for surgical extraction, then do the root canal, cover the root and remove the crown for over-denture abutment. MattKW: Extraction. The radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment will not affect the risk of the extraction. In RAI, the thyroid attracts the radioactivity, not the jawbone."

The only spot where I have trouble flossing is between my upper molar and premolar. My guess is that there is a cavity. I've also experienced dry mouth, gum discomfort under my mandibular teeth (I thing they were shrinking), frequent muscle twitching and night sweats which I initially thought it was because of some tooth infection (even though I didn't had any absces), but now I feel my submandibular glands swollen a little and I think my night sweats was because of salivary gland infection. I also frequently get swollen gums, mostly in the lingual surface of the upper gums and it's not because I have tartar, I can clearly see that I don't. I guess bacteria it is to blame. I also have an weak immune  system, I don't know if that has something to do with all of my teeth and gum issues.\nI've been to 3 different dentists, one of which I've explain what happened and didn't want to restore my teeth (actually she choose to pretend that she sees nothing wrong and said that my upper right first premolar is completely healthy), the other 2, I didn't explain what happened and choose to restore them.

What to do now, get a second opinion or avoid chewing on the right or start using 'sensitive' toothpaste ... any advice welcome (PS NB I have a limited budget). honestdoc: I would keep that area under watch.  The tooth may require a root canal.  If it does, I suggest seeing a root canal specialist since your root canal is probably receded (calcified) and very difficult to access and locate through a crown.  The root canal specialist will need an operating microscope to locate all the canals in your molar and properly clean, shape and fill down to the root tip. rogertb: Thanks HD - really good of you, may I ask a couple of supplementaries, when you say \"keep that area under watch\" what should I keep a look-out for ? also the procedure sounds really complex and therefore expensive, I really don't think I could afford to go down that route (excuse the pun). honestdoc: Intense pain and or swelling.  Pain (everybody has different threshold) may indicate damaged root canal from irreversible inflammation.  Swelling indicates infection from dead nerve.

    "dialogue": "Duchunter: Hello all! I am a 44 year old male from Mobile, AL. When I was a teenager I had a lot of dental work done including braces on my upper teeth. My dentist was not very nice and he made me deathly afraid of going to the dentist, he hurt me a lot. Largely because of that I’ve been to the dentist only once as an adult for a series of cleaning and fillings. I had some cavities filled in my front, upper 4 teeth (I wasn’t even aware that I had cavities). That was about 10 years ago and most of the fillings have fallen out. I’ve actually lost the second, upper tooth on the right side and the left, middle upper tooth is dead. The others have major cavities and I’m close to loosing them.  None of my upper teeth are in good shape really but I dread the thought of dentures. I would really prefer implants. Is it possible to just do a couple of implants at a time? My bottom front teeth are actually in decent shape so it’s just the upper front teeth I’m concerned about at the moment. I’m in retail sales and I just can’t let my teeth get any worse. I know every case is different but is there anyway to estimate what the potential cost would be for implants? I’m not rich by any means and of course I will have to pay out of pocket. I am willing to travel to a dental school or to a low cost dentist or whatever I would need to do to get the cost down. Any info and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. honestdoc: Implants are expensive anywhere in the US.  You can try \"Dental Tourism\" to Mexico or Dominican Republic.  You can try Dental Schools' faculty practice.  Good luck."

I told the hygienist I was sensitive to the ultrasonic and she offered to use some local anesthesia where the most sensitive area is (bottom front). She put quite a lot of it on there. During the cleaning it was running down my tongue and throat and I was feeling like I was going to choke. Afterwards my tongue felt swollen and sandpapery.  I noticed that day my lunch had no taste. The next day I was still noticing a loss of taste so I called them. They said it can take a couple days but I had never had this happen before. I called about a week later and they said I must’ve had an allergic reaction. They prescribed a mouth cleanser but I was wary of taking it. Went to an ENT who told me to give it some time, use a non-sulfate (?) toothpaste, and if it didn’t get better they could try cortisone (I think) on my tongue. I haven’t been back. I do have some taste but I know it’s not the same as it used to be. This dentist also did 12 x-rays which I thought was excessive. My tongue at times feels slightly burned. Is this permanent damage? Any advice? I really miss being able to taste things like I used to. DocT: Sounds like an allergy to me. You need to identify a component causing this reaction. So, see a doctor who can perform allergy test"

Why?  Because the brush moves and IT does the work of removing the plaque, not you, and it will help break that habit of \"scrubbing\" back and forth.  When you use the Sonicare, that brush just vibrates, so you will still need to hold it at a 45 degree angle and brush back and forth so the bristle can do their job.  Not the best choice for your situation.  Also, the BEST dental care products to use for any \"gum\" situation are CLOSYS II products...toothpaste and mouthrinse.  Why listen to me?

    "title": "Periapical abscess (price and dangers of draining?)",
    "dialogue": "bGlitter: I have a deep cavity (with a filling) that developed an abscess 8 months ago. Although there was a bit of pain when it first appeared, I took antibiotics from a dentist. The pain went away but the abscess remained. I know it is recommended to get this drained much earlier.\n\nI am still trying to preserve my tooth without root canal or extraction (although I recognize that could be a possibility). One thing I am worried about is if the draining itself could kill my tooth (assuming it is still alive). I live in California and plan to consult a dental practice in the area. The tooth is my upper second premolar tooth, which I have read can have 1 or 2 roots, each of which can have two \"canals\". My questions are:\n\n1) What dangers are present in the draining of a tooth abscess? Specifically, can the draining procedure itself kill the tooth (assuming it is still alive)? Worries to come to my mind are the practitioner being too aggressive around the tooth nerve, etc.?\n\n2) Can this tooth (upper second premolar) theoretically still be alive if one of its roots is dead (and it happens to have two roots)? If that is a possibility, how can I ensure the dentist does not interfere with a root is not even infected?\n\n3) What is the price of this procedure in my area (for someone without health insurance). For some reason, I cannot even find this basic information online.\n\nI have been putting draining it off for a long time because I just worry that sometimes treatments can cause more problems if done in incompetent (or overly aggressive) manners. This is why I appreciate any ideas so I can be armed with a wider net of knowledge to choose the correct practitioner and be active in the process to protect myself. honestdoc: I think you are missing the point.  Instead of treating the symptom (draining the abscess), you are ignoring what is causing the abscess.  Without x-rays, I'm guessing the the tooth is necrotic (causing the abscess).  The tooth needs a root canal or extraction.  Even if the tooth is multi-rooted and partially necrotic, the tooth will never recover (the vital part will eventually die).  Partially necrotic tooth will not abscess since it has some vital vasculature which means your abscess came from a fully necrotic tooth.\n\nI would not waste any efforts in draining the abscess.  Instead, I would focus on saving the tooth with root canal, core build up and crown or extraction and possible implant if appropriate for your oral condition and budget. bGlitter: Thanks for your response.\n\nI should be more careful with my wording. I do not know if I really have an abscess yet. 14 months ago, I had severe pain in the tooth. My dentist discovered that its filling was too large and was the only point of contact on that side of the mouth - so it was taking all the blunt force each time I chewed. She shaved down the filling and the intense pain stopped. She took an x-ray and checked that there was no black dot by the top of the root (in order to, I believe, check for an abscess or loss of bone structure). I was told my tooth was likely just bruised. 8 month ago, a tender bump formed above the tooth, which I suspect may be pus. I took antibiotics and still do not have any intense pain, other than very mild pain that comes and goes at times.\n\n1) Is it possible that I have a pus-filled region but the X-ray will show no black dots (loss of bone structure). In other words, is it possible to have pus (from an infection) without an abscess? I intend to get an X-ray to check for loss of bone structure (abscess) and, if present, will be more inclined toward serious procedures (like root canal and extraction). However, I do not want to undergo serious procedures prematurely should there not actually be an abscess and this pus infection can simply be removed.\n\n2) What is the general price of pus draining at a dental practice without health insurance in North America? MattKW: Xrays do not always show abscesses, and most dead teeth are diagnosed by other tests, e.g. cold sensitivity, tenderness, history of signs and symptoms. Did your dentist do cold tests?\nYou don't drain pus by an incision in the gums except in cases of large, soft swellings. You can clean out the root canal for lesser abscesses and start some healing that way. that's really starting a root canal treatment.\nIf you do have an abscess, then using antibiotics should only be for emergencies, otherwise repeated use risks the development of resistance and a dangerous infection. bGlitter: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\nXrays do not always show abscesses, and most dead teeth are diagnosed by other tests, e.g. cold sensitivity, tenderness, history of signs and symptoms.

I did a cold sensitivity test (where the dentist put a cold object on the tooth) and I felt the coldness. It was less strong than other teeth and a bit slower. I just repeated it at home with an ice cube and sometimes I do not really feel it but other times I almost certainly feel it. Some of my other teeth also seem to sometimes feel it and sometimes not. However, I do certainly feel the coldness in that tooth sometimes. The percussion test shows that tooth to be quite a bit more sensitive than other teeth. The tooth did experience trauma (constant biting pressure and deep feeling).\n\n2. The pus is large and soft (as far as I know as a layperson). It is not a concentrated point. Would cleaning the pus out through the root canal kill the pulp and tooth and/or weaken these structures? If so, I really hope to avoid it (at least initially) and simply drain through the gum incision. Is this ever done at the dentist and could draining through gum incision itself kill or weaken my tooth (i.e. removal of too much tissue that may or may even be dead)? What is the price for gum incision and pus draining?\n\n3. Thank you for this information about antibiotics. I have been doing massive research on this topic and I did not think about (come across) this danger yet. Fortunately, I have only used the treatment regime once (when the pus first appeared 8 months ago). honestdoc: In my location on the Pacific NW, the full fees for Incision and Drainage code D7510 is $387.00.  In California could be more.  Call and ask for the fees to code D7510.  What did your dentist diagnose your problem with?  I still believe it is best to resolve the cause of the swelling & pus and not drainage.  If you were to come in to my practice, I would diagnose your problem and not do that procedure. Sonia Salamuri: Root Canal therapy or Endodontic Therapy developed a lot, and I think that in USA even more, because it's the home of some well known endodontists, at least, it's what I think. I believe it's expensive, but a good root canal therapy can save your tooth."

    "dialogue": "seamatty: So I was having no pain at all but my dentist wanted to fill 4 teeth as I had developed “pits” in them. They were quite shallow fillings but he needed to drill out a small filling in one of the teeth (bottom molar)...to make a long story short this is the problem tooth now. \n\nI had these fillings almost 3 1/2 weeks ago. Since I was having pain with on of them my dentist redid the filling...that was 10 days ago. It got a little better but I am still having pain when biting on and off (doesn’t happen every time), cold and hot sensitivity on and off (not always). I also am having jaw pain and I do have tmj.\n\nI have seen 2 dentists and both believe this will clear up and I have to give it time. They also suggested I get a night guard as the reason I needed the pits filled was due to grinding and clenching. They think this is the issue. I have never had anything like this so it is certainly frustrating. \n\nAnyone have any input? \n\nI appreciate it! honestdoc: I can understand your frustration.  Any drilling to teeth will cause 2 problems.  First is sensitivity because of the trauma to the nerve (pulp) of the teeth and the second problem is it weakens the teeth depending on the size of the filling.  Drilling is very traumatic because it causes a lot of damaging heat against the teeth.  That is why water spray during drilling is very important.  Dramatic temperature change from heat to cold water can inflame the nerve.  Once the filling is placed, it can change the person's bite.  When a person is anesthetized, that person may not bite the same during bite verification.  Also as the person is laying flat in the dental chair, the bite may be different as opposed to being upright.\n\nI tell my patients after fillings to minimize cold beverages and foods because the teeth will be sensitive to them.  The bite must be comfortable or it will cause unending problems.  Bite guards can be very helpful for your TMJ pain.  When your jaw is at rest, you teeth are about 0.5 cm/0.25 inch apart.  When you clench, your TMJ and muscles are stressed.  Bite guards can stabilize and rest your TMJ and muscles similar to a knee brace. Thisbites: Hi Doc\n\nYes I am glad to read a dentis being so honest and straightforward about the simple facts of trauma to teeth \nduring restorative work.\nWe as patients dont realize just what the teeth go through when work is done on them. I think this is also why i get so anxiety ridden each and every time i go in, its like an instinct to protect my teeth and its so hard on them..the drill, the anesthesia, the cold water, pulling prying, clamping etc. not to mention the poor gums..\nAnd if you already have really sensitive teeth then its just worse.\nBut i wanted to  thank you for being so candid about the reality in the dental chair\nxoxo"

    "title": "Does this implant placement look right?",
    "dialogue": "Peddeh: Hi there,\n\nFirst post here, so go easy on me.\n\nBack in June of this year, I had 4 implants placed to replace my missing teeth (due to neglect - I had not visited the dentist in over a decade but I needed to change). The treatment included included bone grafting in 2 areas and a sinus lift. To cut a long story short, I visited the dentist on 6th of December to expose the implants, 'test' them and taking impressions for the eventual crowns.\n\nThankfully all the implants have bonded really well to the bone, and the dentist seemed very elated with the outcome, gaining 60% of my bone in the sinus area (I saw the big difference on x-rays).\n\nIt wasn't until I got home and looked at the LR6 implant, now exposed, that the positioning seems a little off to me. Maybe I'm just being paranoid, because surely the dentist would have brought it up, right?\n\nAm I right to worry that the positioning of this implant seems far too close to LR7 (image attached).\n\nThanks, MattKW: Too close for my liking. It's going to mean that the replacement crown is going to get a lot of tipping forces. Peddeh: I've dug out the report my dentist sent me before undergoing the treatment and have noticed that the placement doesn't even match this original plan (image attached).\n\nI think I might have to have an awkward conversation with my dentist...\n\nIs there any logic to why this might have been placed the way it was? MattKW: Yep, a discussion is required; I'm guessing he did this without a template guide and so the drill has followed the soft socket bone where the other tooth was extracted. Get a new Xray of where it is now. You might be able to get another implant in the remaining space, but this may not be the person to do it. The angulations of another implant and resultant crowns are certainly going to conflict with what you already have there. Probably time to see a prosthdontist. Peddeh: Contacted my dentist by telephone and he has stated that the implant is where it needs to be. He's told me not to worry about it and that it will be fine.\n\nNot sure what to do next. MattKW: Go in for an appointment. Be polite and keep calm; maybe take a friend or partner with you. Ask for an Xray of the current situation and upload a copy. Ask him to explain how the different placement from the original will affect the final crown. If not happy, ask for referral to a prosthodontist. Peddeh: Hi Matt,\n\nThanks for your reply. A one to one appointment has been made with the dentist so we can discuss my concerns. I feel really awful about doing this to him, I just hope he won't be offended, as I feel like I'm criticising his work.\n\nIn the meantime, I've booked an appoint with an implantologist a bit out of town, who is very reputable, who has agreed to see me for a review/second opinion.\n\nI did not think to ask if the dentist could send me an xray but I will request this tomorrow morning and upload it here if I'm able to get them to send it electronically, otherwise I will wait until my one to one appointment. MattKW: We all make mistakes, and if he's genuinely concerned he will take your concerns on board and help you out. He will have insurance which should cover any extra treatment. And I don't think there is a specialty as an implantologist, but rather a general dentist, periodontist, oral surgeon, or prosthodontist who have experience in implants. DocT: Well, I would not be so certain and monosemantic In regards to this matter. As far as I could see, on provided CBCT / 3D image with a virtual implant placement prior actual surgery from June, posterior or back tooth LR7 already appeared inclined, tilted, leaning forward. In 5-6 month, depends on how fast it was moving, tooth easily might show even more advanced inclination combined with tooth bodily movement in the absence of restriction from missing tooth LR6. In this case you have two options : 1 - limited orthodontic treatment to upright LR7 or 2 - implant level impression with customized gum contouring around implant platform to creat more desirable and physiological crowns contour and contact with adjacent teeth. MattKW: In 6 months, with no opposing occlusion, the LR7 won't have moved. And the dentist can't move the implant so any pontic will be unfavourably cantilevered. DocT: Dentist doesn't need to move implant - tooth on the distal of implant was tilted from the very beginning and can be upright orthodontically in a reasonably short time; approximately 3 month period .Half a year is sufficient time for tooth to move and inclined even further. \n\n \n\n\n\n\nIt is really hard to tell where implant was positioned in respect to remaining dentition when image is taken 6 months later - implant can't move, but teeth connected to bone via ligaments, definitely can and will. That is why people go for provisional for healing period. MattKW: What will be achieved by up righting the 2nd molar? I will assume that there is also an opposing upper 2nd molar that possibly locks it in. Nor will uprighting improve the poor positioning of the implant, and any crown placed on that implant will have a large cantilever effect. DocT: 1 - https://www.osseonews.com/mandibular-left-second-molar-tipping-how-should-i-manage-this/\n\n\n\n\n\n ... 16 weeks after surgical installation, I performed the Stage 2 uncovery surgery and found that #18 [mandibular left second molar; 37]        had tipped mesially into the space for #19 reducing the mesial-distal space available for the implant crown.  \n    A fixed retainer should be placed as a preventive measure (immediately after 1st stage surgery )\n    But now :\n    Orthodontic uprighting of mesially tipped 2nd molar...\n 2 - https://benthamopen.com/ABSTRACT/TODENTJ-11-466\n     Tipped lower molar over edentulous space is very common in orthodontics practice when adults seek treatment. \n 3 - https://www.intechopen.com/online-f...ual-spaces-of-missing-molars-decision-factors\n      ...In case of permanent molar absence, making decision becomes even more delicate. The practitioner must use his/her critical sense         and clinical common sense to make the right choice ...\n 4 - https://read.qxmd.com/keyword/23736\n      Orthodontic treatment to upright an inclined molar adjacent to an edentulous space is often necessary before implant placement.  \n 4 - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31784019\n      The severely inclined second molars were uprighted in 5 months, and the enhanced implant sites were ready for implant placement           without complications. \n             I would be extremely careful with any conclusions based on intra oral photo taken unprofessionally, under unknown angle and probably with cellphone. Without radiographic image we can't really estimate what the exact implant position in regards to the root of posterior molar. Uprighting tilted tooth on the distal of implant would allow to create parallel path of insertion / positioning of planned prosthetic restoration - implant supported or implant abutment supported crown. In single unit restoration you can't really create cantilever restoration due to limited space; besides, implant supported anterior cantilevered restorations are still widely accepted, unlike posterior cantilevered design. The only real concern in this situation is proper development of emergence profile, that still can be designed by customized tissue management, like custom healing abutment followed by implant level custom impression coping. Of course it would be more important decision in case of implant positioning distally, rather that molar tilting mesially. About overerupted  opposing dentition, I'm not an orthodontist and honestly do not know technical details, however I work in close proximity to the orthodontist. Between our two practices we have a lot of cases with misplaced and worn dentition required interdisciplinary approach MattKW: Perhaps this particular complication and extra work could've been avoided if the 3rd molar had been extracted before the implant surgery. DocT: It was not the matter of discussion, and yes, I would extract third molar and provide patient with provisional for healing period,( never go without space reservation) and if any ortho is needed it would be done prior implant placement ( personally I do not allow braces removal till implant supported provisional is in place). But we do not know what happen, not enough of data. Of course implant appears to be positioned posterior and asymmetrical; but for conclusion we need at least two images : x-rays or two CBCTs taken - first - when implant was placed and - second - after second stage surgery. Besides, patient might develop insufficient amount of bone at the site of the mesial root of extracted first molar and dentist positioned body of implant in the most stable well developed area for the most predictable result. As we all know, ridge width is a critical criteria. Besides that, as more I look at 3D image, as more I think that we are talking about third molar and implant positioned in second molar edentulous site - space b/w second bicuspid and existing / remaining molar is way too big for single tooth missing. In this case, first molar was lost long time ago, most likely without any ridge preservation treatment and might show significant horizontal resorption resulting in insufficient ridge width for proper implant diameter for posterior restoration. MattKW: Perhaps you misunderstand, but I was referring to the case you showed in previous answer. Not talking about the OP.\n\nEven without the most recent Xray of the OPs implant, don't you think that the dentist has allowed his implant drill to accidentally follow the softer tissue into the space created by the extraction? \nHis planning radiographs show where he intended it to go, but I think he didn't use a surgical guide and has made a simple error. \nTrying to put a crown on the implant where it is currently placed and angled will make for a very poor crown. Peddeh: Apologies for not responding, work and the Christmas festivities has had me tied down.\n\nI've since had my one to one with my dentist and unfortunately (or fortunately? I'm not sure what way to take it), my dentist still doesn't see a problem with the placement.\n\nHe filled the previous 'hole' (sorry if this isn't the dental technical word for it) with bone graft material that was left after the tooth extraction during the initial placement surgery, which makes me wonder why we didn't just wait for that to heal and then place the implant in the position where the tooth was but he re-assuringly told me that the placement of the implant is in the best place based on the quality of my bone.\n\nHe's told me if I'm still not happy after the crown placement, we can re-assess. I'm inclined to believe I should trust his judgement but I don't know, I'm conflicted. I guess all I can do is wait .\n\nI'm looking for a second opinion, specifically with a prosthondist (as you suggested, Matt), I just need to find one locally first.\n\nThe dentist told me they would send me digital copies of my latest 3D scans / xrays but I'm still waiting for them. I will chase them up after the new year (the surgery is closed until then, except for emergencies) and post them on here for your opinions.\n\nThanks, MattKW: OK, post up Xrays when available."

Hope the quality of the images isn't too bad to read!\n\n\n\nBaby teeth A and K never had any adult teeth come in underneath.

Worried about leaving #1 is my mouth for too long because how bad it seems. I think I once had very dull pain with it, but that stopped pretty quickly so I didn't think much of it. It is still sensitive to cold.

Hopefully you have enough financially to restore them.  Return promptly to your dentist when you can to treat your other concerns. DocT: Absolutely agree with honestdoc. Just would also include tooth #13 due to pretty extensive lesion / caries on distal; you definitely don't want another root canal, since #14 already requires one. So, I would start with #13-14 to \n1 - prevent root canal #13 and \n2 - emergency situation with #14.\n3 - A and K both have large decay under existing restorations and probably are going to go any way; wouldn't worry much about them, unless you are planning to restore them with also root canals and crowns\n4 - keep an eye on #29 since that one also has a lesion on distal and you never can rely on x-ray image in attempt to estimate the real size of defect\n5 - wisdom teeth most likely not going to cause any problems in the nearest future. jestss: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI think #A, K, and 14 are the most urgent.

Thank you so much for the advice! I have a few other questions after getting another exam and a full set of x-rays with a different local dentist recommended by family.\n\nFor A & K, one dentist recommended extraction and implant for both, while the other just recommended fillings for them. I expect I would still need to get implants down the line, but I am 22 at the moment, and have heard that it is best to wait until late 20's or later to get implants. How true is that? Would I be better getting them repaired and revisiting in a couple years when I'm older, or just leaving them until they hurt or fall out to do implants, presumably much sooner than if I got them repaired?\n\nI was also recommended deep cleaning by the second dentist, as I was told I have pockets and early signs of gum disease, which could get much worse if left untreated (x-rays attached). How urgent is this compared to 14, A & K, 13, and 29, and is there anything I can do to reverse or slow it down if I don't get it treated right away?\n\nFinally, the first dentist listed a lot fewer cavities (13, 14, 29) to work on than the second dentist (2, 3, 12, 13, 18, 19, 29, 30, and 31) than. Am I fine in assuming that the second dentist is just more aggressive in treatment, and that the other ones listed are lesser cavities I should be fine with leaving for treatment further down the line? I will definitely be visiting the dentist regularly in the future, so they should be able to catch any issues before they worsen, right?\n\nThanks again! DocT: When you are aiming restorative work, like fillings and crowns, panoramic x-ray is not the best one. Second doctor obtained much more accurate radiographic data and he is right, all those cavities are pretty visible."

I appreciate it very much. honestdoc: I agree with the dentist.  However, I see tiny incipient cavities between tooth #13 & 14 (UL 2nd premolar and 1st molar).  Those tiny cavities can be monitored since they may not penetrate through the enamel if you floss daily.  You may also have slight recession (bone) and gum disease (inflammation) due to no cleaning in ~10 years so deep cleaning and regular maintenance should prevent further damage.  Don't neglect your teeth or further irreversible damage can occur. ToothlessAggression: Thank you so much for your reply. I do indeed floss at least after every meal if not more.

I have been advised to come back on Friday (so, 2 days later) to have the remaining tooth removed which will be mid-course antibiotic treatment.\n\nCan anyone reassure me that this type of situation can happen? I am scared that I have picked a dentist for implants and the general dentistry isn't as good as the implant technology.\n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts. honestdoc: Putting myself in your dentist's place, the reason for the return visit is to minimize further trauma in removing the remaining root.

I couldnt even touch it with my finger and i mean like barely brush up against it. I immediatley made an emergency dentist appointment at a local dentist and he looked in there for 2 seconds and said \"Fractured tooth, antibiotics and possibly a root canal and a crown\" They didnt accept my insurance but the dentist i wanted to goto only did emergency visits on wednesdays so i had to wait 2 more days so i figured pay for this one out of pocket and ill go to them on wednesday and they can just fix me. I make the emergency appointment at my dentist (mind you very very good dentist ive never seen such a nice dentist office cozy and everything and they have amazing reviews so i feel like i trust them) anyways so im at my emergency appointment and i tell the woman who initially took me back what was going on she took some xrays and at this point the tooth wasnt hurting so bad. it would hurt every once and awhile when id eat ( i was eating on other side of my mouth at this point but sometimesthe tooth would hit another or my cheek just right and it'd hurt) New dentist comes in and she looks at the xrays she just took and said that i had no abscess and she couldnt see any fractures and that all my teeth on that side of my mouth looks beautiful and healthy. She then banged on the tooth and surrounding ones and had me bite down on some stuff which at this point the tooth really wasnt hurting anymore just every once and awhile it was really random when i'd get a jolt of pain. So the plan was to finish the antibiotic and she told me it was probably my sinuses. So now a week and a half later its still hurting so im thinking maybe first dentist was right and it is fractured because it was hurting everyday but it would start as a couple small jolts and move to becoming more constant probably because i keep messing with it but so far not as bad as that first day where it was sensitive to my finger touching it. but it has been sensitive to brush twice since then as well. So back on track, now i made a 3rd dentist appointment with the same woman who said my stuff was healthy. this time she did a full mouth exam and really did a thorough job i felt and she took like 22 xrays. I do still have my wisdom teeth as well. Now on this day of course the tooth hadnt bothered me at all the entire day which was a first time since i chomped on that bacon. So she banged on the tooth had me do some more bite tests had me bite on a piece of paper and she did say i was biting a little harder on that tooth so she shaved it a little bit. she also held a qtip with some really cold spray stuff on it but she id say it was a little bit of a delayed reaction but she said its because my pulp was higher up and she really didnt seem to worried about it. She said that she really felt that my tooth is not fractured she said every one of my teeth look healthy. i even said i wanted my wisdom teeth out and she said that she didnt even think it was neccessary she said they look beautiful and no cavities. so she said that she could tell i grind my teeth so she suggested a mouth guard which i went and got today (2 days after my dentist appointment) and my appointment was thursday so i didnt have any tooth pain thursday or friday. i did finish the antibiotic i was originally given as well. today is saturday and my tooth is hurting. Im not stuffy so i dont know abotu allergies but i will say this and i dont know if it means anything but my tooth i do not think has bothered me yet in the evening. I had been thinking maybe the first dentist was spot on with the fractured tooth but then the pain went away so maybe it really isnt fractured and it really is a grinding thing that im not noticing or a sinus thing even though im not swollen eyes or stuffy?\n\nI do hope i wasnt to all over the place with this. And i also know my grammar and spelling is horrible try not to fault me to much i was an infantryman so this really isnt my cup of tea.\nanyways any suggestions would be appreciated. svor1988: Sometimes that just happens as a function of eating. Sometimes, due to leverage a hard object may push or twist the tooth slighty. Further, your teeth move all the time to equalibrium. Your pain is gone. No problems.\nI'm suspicious of your first doctor for playing off of your anxiety.\nDrilling down that tooth likely wasn't absolutely necessary either, as the opposing force would push down the tooth just fine (then again she would know better). For insight: if there is so tooth opposing it above/below super eruption may occur. Go look up super-eruption. HUSKER222: i dont know how i even accidetally got to this. lol 4 years ago now since i posted this and i never saw the reply. Just want to say thank you. I havent had any pain since then \"Knock on Wood\" but yeah that first doctor was weird telling me i needed a root canal and it was fractured. 2nd doctor couldnt find anything and the pain did go away. We chalked it up to when i bit down on the bacon i mustve aggravated a nerve in the pulp? I was also pulling sheets of dry wall down doing some demo in the house a week prior to that and like a moron i didnt have a mask so i couldve had a sinus thing going on too because i did catch a cold from it.\n\nthanks again Svor1988"

A few days prior to the follow up appointment, the teeth around tooth 14 had throbbing pain. Sometimes the pain would be resulting of biting down, other times it seemed to just hurt. The throbbing pain would come and go. There was minor sensitivity to heat/cold. The morning of the followup appointment, I woke up and the upper left side of my mouth/jaw was swollen. Near the bottom left of the nose, toward the left (toward the left ear), not a great distance maybe 3-4cms. You could see that area was swollen.\n\nMy luck was that it happened the day of the follow up appointment. I visited the endodontist and explained the situation. He tapped teeth, put hot/cold instrument on the gum line, etc. I had a regular x-ray taken. He determined that a 3D xray (CT scan?) was needed. That was done in his office and he determined that tooth 15 needs a root canal. Antibiotic (Amoxicillin) was prescribed and an appointment was scheduled for root canal.\n\nI was hoping someone could help me with some dental health questions I had:\n\n1. Could the infection from tooth 14 spread to tooth 15? Is it easy to miss an infected root on xray? Would the infection have been spread sooner?\n\n2.The antibiotic has been taken for roughly 3.5 days and the swelling is almost gone. There is no throbbing pain as earlier. However, when I press along the upper left quadrant of my mouth, there is minor pain. If I press upward from the left canine tooth, I can feel it's a little swollen still and has minor pain when pressed. Can I be confident that the correct tooth (tooth 15) is receiving the root canal?\n\n3. I have been more diligent with promoting good oral hygiene habits. However, it seems that this infection is new, or was missed on prior exams. What else can I do besides brushing/flossing/mouthwash? \n\n4. Can I assume that with the dental exam/xray and the swelling being almost eliminated with the antibiotic that there isn't a tumor in that area?\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post."

I started brushing a lot the day it happened thinking maybe I needed to \"brush the inflammation away\", I thought maybe there was something stuck under my gum.

I didn't take care of myself in any way for a while after a very long depressive episode, that included my oral care. I barely brushed my teeth during that time. About a month or so ago I decided it was time to start getting everything back on track with myself. During that episode, I developed white spot lesions, again I am positive it is from bad oral hygiene. Cosmetically, I don't care what my teeth look like, I just care if my teeth and gums are healthy or not. \n\nI started working on cutting down on soda and drinking more bottled water. \nI brush my teeth twice a day with Crest Complete Flouride Toothpaste(Image below) with a manual toothbrush. \nI floss once a day.\nI chew sugar free gum containing xylitol. \n\nI won't get into my dentist office for at least another month, which I don't mind too much at the moment.

A_s: Hi,\n\nDo you take any medications? Any hospitalisations? Any medical conditions?\nDo you have water fluoridation in the area you lived in? What other fluoride aids do you use?\nHow frequently do you eat snacks per day (include fruits)? How frequently do you drink acidic drinks per day? Do you drink alcohol? \nWhich brushing technique do you brush? Do you brush at an angle of 45 degrees slightly towards your gums? Do you brush systematically from one side to the other side? Do you brush for 2 minutes? \nDo you do tongue scraping?\nDo you only expectorate after you brush instead of rinsing with a lot of water?\nAre you using a soft manual toothbrush? A soft one is recommended.\n\nSome advice includes but not limited to are:\nThe more frequent it is to snack, the more likely it is to develop decay. It is not about the amount, but the frequency (but the amount - can affect your general health). \nTry not to brush immediately before/after you consume sugar. \nTry not to eat anything else after brush at night. \nDo not rinse too thoroughly with water after you brush your teeth (we want the fluoride to be in your mouth for as long as possible, but do not want too much fluoride to be ingested at the same time). So can just expectorate, instead of rinsing with water too thoroughly.\nCan also try an electrical toothbrush (but the key is to have good brushing technique and have 2 minutes brushing time). \n\nMore advice will need more information from you.

That has meant I have so far had 3 sets of dentures due to the gum shrinkage.\n\nNow it has been 14 months since my teeth were removed will my gums carry on shrinking or should that have stopped by now? Hi ennogs,\n\nYour gum shrinks along with bone resorption after teeth removed. Most of the bone resorption happens in the first 6 months after teeth are removed, but this will continue throughout the lifetime at a much slower rate (around 0.05-0.2mm/year, this can also vary between each individual). The lower jaw bone resorption will be more than the upper jaw bone resorption.\n\nIf dentures are not fitting well, one of the alternatives is to do reline, but reline normally only lasts 1-2 years. So frequent visit to the dentist (around once a year) is required to change reline.\n\nA denture adhesive may also help, but must always be removed/clean thoroughly after removal of the denture.\n\nOr you can always have new sets of dentures if you are not satisfied with the current sets or reline. Dentures also take time to adapt, some can adapt to them in a few weeks, while others take years to adapt to. The lower dentures are more difficult to adapt to than the upper dentures, because of the anatomical structures (movable tongue, cheeks, etc) and more bone resorptions. \n\nIf you are really struggling with the dentures you have, another alternative is to have implant overdentures but that does not mean they will completely improve the fitting. This is just an alternative or something to try out but does not mean it will solve the problem. Also, the bone resorption will only be slowed in area where the implants have inserted (normally 2-4 implants for overdentures in lower and in the upper jaw). Besides, this has a lot of things to consider (e.g. cost, surgical risk, general health conditions) and require a lot of maintenance as well.\n\nHope this helps."

My new dentist found a dark spot on that root in x-ray so he did retreatment. He drilled the old crown, did the job and sealed the hole. It was okay. But when I came home, the hole wasn't fully sealed so I went back a week later. The nightmare began from then. He not only filled up the hole but trimmed down too low and I had a low filling. To compensate, my tooth 45 felt bigger, sore and gum got weaken. I went back to fix the filling, he refused saying it's because my clenching so I need a night guard. (I went to see a different doctor later and he said I don'clench). I tried to get by, but now it's almost three months past and my chewing and speaking felt different. First time, I doubted about TMJ but I didn't have any pain or symptoms.... I searched more, now I am wondering if my jaw muscles have changed to adapt the new occlusion. It's definatley different since it all happened. The new doctor said one tooth doesn't make those changes but I can feel them... I suggested a new crown but he turned down... I really don't know how to fix it...is it just my damaged old crown or changed jaw muscle to affect my alignment? MattKW: Too hard to say. Any Xrays taken before and after retreatment might help. Sammay: The before and after x-ray shows obvious change in height of tooth 35 as the previous dentist thought my crown was still too high and ground up to the the height to my molar beside.. I know high filling is more problematic but can a low filling cause a change? When I chew or speak in certain pronnounciations, my bottom front teeth hit behind the upper front teeth... it feels like something lightly off the balance since.... Sammay: And FYI, the previous doctor emailed me that he would offer a free crown but I haven't got back because I don't want him to screw up more... I remember he explained that he needed to split my old crown half vertically to cap the new one on but it doesn't make sense to me because I think there should be least damage to save the foundation.... MattKW: Crowns can be safely taken off by sectioning as he suggest without damaging underneath. As long as it's done carefully there is very low risk of anything going wrong. If he's offering to make a new crown, this is a part admission that the existing one isn't satisfactory. You would be better asking for your money back and going somewhere else."

    "dialogue": "rideforever: Hi\n\nI have some strange symptoms. \nMy Maxillary Molar UL6 has a constant dull ache and if I eat sweet food it hurts a lot; seems like tooth decay.\nBut the worst thing is just above it on the face I get a red patch right after I eat after about 5 minutes.  And I use an oral jet and quickly clean my mouth after I eat and then the redness subsides.\nIn the morning the redness is very pale but then I eat and bam it goes red again.\nThe patch has started to get bigger over several months.\nIn fact it has been going on for 2 years or so thinking back.\nIn the beginning the redness I thought might be suntan.\nBut definitely after eating it goes red and fast.\nI would say it's obviously tooth decay or infection, but the dentist can't see anything on the Xray.\n\nFrom the photo of the tooth it looks like the gum in front of it is a bit purple, like an infection.\nFrom the Xray all I can see is that on the left side the filling at the crown seems to not be joined up in a straight line to the tooth, as if the tooth has decayed away from the filling.\nAnd then on the left side of the tooth there seems to be a widened channel on the left side going into the gums, which is a bit strange.\nSo, I imagine that there is a bit of decay in the tooth near the gum line and it has made the gum purple and some food or saliva gets pushed in there when I eat.\nBut the dentist says she can't see anything when inspecting it visually.\n\nPerhaps someone can give me advice.\nthank you honestdoc: I cannot explain for the redness on your face everytime you eat something.  Only explanation for redness is your body's reaction to something like allergies.  Are you taking any medications, herbal supplements, new toothpaste, oral rinse, cinnamon products, and or some kind of substance your body does not recognize?  I don't see any cavities on x-ray or picture.  I see gum recession and exposed root surface on UL6 (tooth #14) that may explain your sensitivty to sweets.  With gum recession, you get some \"black triangles\" that could trap food and debris and cause discomfort.  If your symptoms of UL teeth discomfort continues, I would check the tooth in front UL5 (#13).  The filling is very close to the nerve.  If the nerve is vital and healthy then great.  If not, it may need a root canal.  Another possibility is sinus pain which can mimic teeth pain.  If you have more pronounced pain bending forward for going up & downstairs, see your physician for possible sinus infection.  Many times grinding & clenching can also cause pain & discomfort. rideforever: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\t.. Thanks for your opinion.\nSweet food hurts teeth with tooth decay but not soft tissues or wounds in the mouth ... as far as I know.\n\nThe most important thing is the redness as it has spread to the entire left check up to the nose and even some parts of the face on the other side, over many months.\n\nI can categorically rule out any sinus problems because I have had many since young swimmning so much.  But I haven't had anything for years and no longer swim.  And I would know.   This redness is the same every single day, every single meal.\n\nI can also rule out any skin condition.  There is zero sensitivity on the skin.  Nothing.   I get hayfever and eczema from time to time and have had a few rashes, fungal conditions and bites.   It is nothing like that.   This redness is the same every single day every single meal.\n\nAnd I am in very good health so no immune conditions whatsoever.\nThe redness is caused by the food and is cleared (at least partially) by irrigating that tooth.\nIt is the same every day for many months even more than a year when I was aware of it, and more than 2 years most likely looking back.\n\nSo, however difficult the symptoms might seem ... those are the symptoms.\nThe redness began originally just above the tooth on the cheek.\nI can only assume that the food or bacteria are circulating through the bloodstream from that tooth, because nothing else would make my face red after food and cleared after irrigation.  \nOn the pictures there is purple discolouration and white spots (might be the flash)  on the gum in front of the tooth.\nAdditionally pressing on the tooth UL6 hurts. MattKW: Did the dentist p[ulp test the tooth (a cold spray)? Have you tried desensitising toothpaste, and with what result? rideforever: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid the dentist p[ulp test the tooth (a cold spray)? Have you tried desensitising toothpaste, and with what result? Yes used cold spray but no big reaction.\nI am using a desensitising toothpaste but I am used to the dull ache anyway and it doesn't bother me.\n\nBut the problem is the redness is still appearing after food and it has spread out to the entire cheek, lower eyelid, up to the nose.  After I clean my teeth the redness is reduced but there is a residual redness.  \n\nIt seems to me the only thing that would cause it is an infection and bacterima. rideforever: Initially the redness was just over the tooth (UL6, or the left side of this drawing) but it has spread out left and right and after many months crossed to the other side.\nParticularly on the nose the bridge is solid red but at the tip of the nose frequently there was a red mark on either side.\nIn my opinion this is following the blood vessels, meaning the redness is caused by something entering the bloodstream upon eating.\n\nThere is zero sensitivity or irritation on the face.  Zero.  Therefore it is not rossacea or any allergy.\nAfter oral jet sometimes I am using Hydrogen Peroxide solution in it, the redness is much reduced.\n\nSo my only conclusion is that there is some infection that is entering the vessels from that tooth, even though it does not seem to appear from the xray.\n\nHowever on the xray on the left side there is clearly visible a channel on the left side of the tooth that is wide and goes deeply in the gum.  Why would that channel be widened ?  Why is it not on the other teeth ?\nWhy does the tooth hurt on eating sugar ?\nSurely the only answer is that there is some decay on that side of the tooth that is preventing the gum healing and closing that channel.\n\nI can think of no other diagnosis that works with the symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking closer at that area of the xray.  There is that black channel on the left of the tooth and if we look down (i.e. above the gum) the tooth is not solid white.  Is that not some decay on the surface at the gum line ?\nIf there was decay there that was causing an infection in the gum ... the photos show discolouration there, then that channel will not heal and food will go down that channel.\n\nDentists have told me that this black channel is on all teeth.  But on the xray it is not; it is only on this tooth.\n\nThe problem for me is that I can get the tooth removed no problem.\nBut it is large tooth and would be a loss, however I have no choice.\n\nI would like a dentist to do a filling at the gum line, but they are not keen to do so.\nIn my opinion it is worth doing or the tooth will simply be pulled out and lost. MattKW: If the tooth feels sweet pain or cold sensations then it is not dead and there is no uncontrolled infection.\nThere is no decay at the gumline. You may be mistaking it for radiographic burnout. Dentists don't want to do it because it is not there.\nDecay does not cause infection in the gum.\nIf the rash is going across to the other side of the face, then it cannot be related to this tooth.\nI think what you perceive as a black channel is simply radioluclent cancellous bone; there's nothing abnormal in the apperance of the bone.\nMaybe you should see a dermatologist.  This does not appear to be a dental issue. rideforever: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\nIf the tooth feels sweet pain or cold sensations then it is not dead and there is no uncontrolled infection.\nThere is no decay at the gumline.

Dentists don't want to do it because it is not there.\nDecay does not cause infection in the gum.\nIf the rash is going across to the other side of the face, then it cannot be related to this tooth.\nI think what you perceive as a black channel is simply radioluclent cancellous bone; there's nothing abnormal in the apperance of the bone.\nMaybe you should see a dermatologist.  This does not appear to \nIf you feel sweet pain then yes the tooth is not dead ... but this is a sign of tooth decay which is an infection.  Toothache.\n\nDecay (infection) which is in contact with the gum certainly can cause infection at the gum.  Why wouldn't it, it is one infection in contact with other tissues.\n\nThe redness began above the tooth, after many months it spread outwards, in all directions.   This is simply the spread of infection.  Knowing the history you can see the progress.  That is what the history is there for.\nThe pattern of redness indicates it is in the blood vessels.\nAnd on the photos is discolouration in the gum at the point.\nThat is a lot of evidence.\n\nThe black channel in not a bone !!!  It seems to be a space at the point in the gum which is purple on the photos.\n\nAccording to the symptoms it could only be a tooth infection.\n\nBut I appreciate no smoking gun is on the xray.\n\nI find your answers quite unintelligent in several ways.\n\nLooking at various dentistry photos I see that dentists deal with people with terrible teeth, big gaps, big black marks on the xray and so on.\nMy case is very slight because I take a lot of trouble with my teeth every day. \nPerhaps I should stop cleaning my teeth until this decay enlarges and the dentist can \"see it\".\n\n\nI remember being in hospital once after a football game, my leg didn't feel good.  I had 2 doctors inspect it and told me there was \"nothing wrong\" and proceeded to walk me around the waiting room.  But I refused to walk on that leg.  Then they got angry and told me to get lost and that I was wasting everyone time.   After 20mins of this abuse I refused and they finally xrayed the leg.\nClean break straight through the fibula.\nThen the doctors disappeared. No apology.\nSo much for doctors !!!

Good luck. rideforever: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tOK, I offered my free opinion based on the evidence you presented, and you choose to go your own way. Good luck. Thanks all the same."

What is my time limit and what happens after that limit?\n\nThanks honestdoc: The consequence of missing teeth will involve the supporting bone to recede, any opposing teeth left unopposed to erupt higher and any teeth behind to shift forward.  Depending on teeth positioning, the adjacent teeth as well as opposing teeth could shift to a more stable position. A lot of my patients can not afford implants and they continue on with their lives.  If you are considering replacement with implants, there may be other considerations such as bone grafting and possible sinus lift surgery.  Also if you smoke, you must quit as well as controlling any medical conditions such as diabetes to provide better healing conditions for the implant.

The pain is relieved but effect only lasts about 2 hours. I've also been using cold packs.\nIs this normal?? \nI'll visit my GP on Monday.\nThe pain is really unbearable.\nThanks for reading MattKW: No, go back to the dentist and have the socket redressed. In some cases it might take 2-3 dressings before you get comfortable. You say you went back on Friday (in pain again?), the pack was removed and infection confirmed. Was it repacked? A dry socket is NOT an infection so antibiotics are useless and unscientific. A GP might give you antibiotics for a dry socket but that's because they don't understand about them. Cygnet: Thanks for taking time to respond. The dentist said it was infected but didn't offer to repack it. To be honest when he took the dressing out it was less painful and did not smell too good.\nI had a weekend from hell, never had such a painful experience. I went to my GP earlier and got naproxen and extra strength co-codamol and so far so good but I am exhausted. MattKW: OK, you might be over the worst of it. A dry socket will eventually heal by itself but the dental dressings buy you time while the healing gets underway. Cygnet: Thanks for replying.

    "dialogue": "Du_deleted: Hi,\nI am having sinus infection and little toothache on upper molars. I went to the doctor and they told me to go for PNS x-ray to check if I have some infection. She told me that may cause toothache too. And she told me that there looks like infection in 2 of my sinuses. And have me antibiotics. She is a new doctor. I am planning to go for a second opinion too.\nI am just looking here if anyone knows to read pns xray? honestdoc: Not many dentists are trained in reading the ParaNasal Sinus x-rays.  The best bet is to get referred to an Ear-Nose-Throat specialist.  It is important to have the sinuses evaluated & cleared before evaluating the upper molars.  I had a case where this lady had pain with an upper molar.   Tests were very vague and I was hesitant on initiating any treatment.  This happened for 3 visits and with each visit, I advised her to visit an ENT doctor to check here sinuses.  On the 4th visit, she told me the ENT said there were no sinus problems (no images were taken) so I completed the root canal.  Shortly afterwards, she returned complaining of having the same pain on the tooth.  A different ENT took some images and sure enough there was a sinus problem. Nandhini K M: I agree with honestdoc. Sinus infection will give referred pain on the upper molar teeth. It is better to evaluate with ENT specialist before approaching a dentist. If you are doubtful, I would say to get the second opinion with your PNS x-ray with an ENT specialist before taking antibiotics. In the meantime, you can do steam inhalation which is pretty harmless and helps to soothe the nasal walls. MattKW: Simple test for sinus infections. Sit down, then drop your head quickly down to your knees and back up again. If that gives pain, then it's sinusitis, not teeth. Can also try treating as if a sinus infection (nasal sprays, steam inhalation, antibiotics), and if the pain settles, then it was prob a sinus infection."

Thank you for any info. honestdoc: It is possible to consume very sweet and acidic foods or beverages and still not get cavities.  There is a study that demonstrated acid in carbonated beverages can soften enamel and recommend not to brush until after an hour to minimize enamel damage.  If a person is fortunate enough not to have dental problems with high sugar consumption, he or she may be a risk for diabetes.

    "title": "I have no idea what happened",
    "dialogue": "PaulS: I'm in the UK and have always had a brilliant NHS dentist. A car accident decades ago required me to have my two front teeth pin crowned - no problems, no issues - regular check ups, two fillings and an occasional lecture. \n\nA week ago I bit into something unexpectantly hard and one of the crowns fell out. I went to my NHS dentist but, as I was not in pain, I would have to wait three weeks for an appointment - three weeks with a yawning gap in my front teeth !!! ... so I went to a private dentist\n\nFirst thing I was greeted with was a bill for £70, for making the appointment it seems, I hadn't even seen a dentist at this time. they sat me down in the plush waiting room and had me filling in a medical questionnaire - I had started to declare my type 1 diabetes, my heart attack and my warfarin treatment but was ushered in to a dentist chair and the incomplete questionnaire lifted out of my hands\n\nThe dentist told me I needed an X-ray (£20), so I had one. She then said she needed to redo the X-ray so I had another one (another £20) which was exactly the same as the first. She explained an infection may have pushed the crown out, I explained I had bitten into something hard. Undeterred she said that the X-rays didn't show any infection but it could be hidden, so she needed to do a root canal treatment requiring four return visits before the crown could be reattached - total cost £1,000\n\nI looked at the X-rays, I could see the original root canal 'post' in place; the X-ray (to my untrained eye) seemed no different to the attached crown right beside it, I couldn't see any infection or anything else. She ignored this and told me that she would have to drill out the original root canal but there was a risk she would destroy the remaining tooth root, then requiring an implant at £3000\n\nI told her I could not afford this and could she simply not glue the crown back on, I could then go to my NHS dentist for any follow up treatment. This only paused her  \"You're registered with another dentist ?\", before she told me I required at least three visits to the private hygienist, a complete check up, two further X rays all with her private practise - only £400\n\nShe was probing around in mouth constantly, while doing what I realised was a sales pitch. I recall her paying particular attention to one of my lower teeth, I thought she had found a problem\n\nEventually she simply glued the crown back on, charged me a further £300 for this and gave me a recommended treatment plan. My mouth was constantly bleeding, I told her I was taking warfarin, her reaction was \"Oh\" but nothing else. She offered me a private prescription for antibiotics, I asked her if there was an infection and she quickly said \"its precautionary\" - in hindsight I should have asked her what the proposed root canal was for if infection-control was 'precautionary'  \n\nI paid and fled, the 40 minute ordeal had cost me £410\n\nI went to my NHS dentist who confirmed that the crown had been reattached really well, he said he would have done it between patients at a maximum of £62.10 if I had known I was in the waiting room … I mentioned the requirement of a root canal, his reply was \"Why?\", I mentioned the requirement of three visits to a hygienist, his reply was \"that's always wise, but why three?\" … X-rays \"Why?\"\n\nTwo days later I started to suffer quite bad pain from one of my lower teeth, the one the private dentist had shown so much interest in. Scared her suspicions of a problem were correct, and in pain, I got an appointment with my NHS dentist (£22.70) - after a cursory glance, he asked if I had done anything to rock the tooth in its socket - I replied that I had not, but well aware that the private dentist definitely had - he said to give it a few days to settle down and sure enough, two days later, the pain that would have had me scurrying off to the private dentist had gone away\n\nI can understand the sales pitch, I really can, but it appears that she was willing to destroy a perfectly good crown to justify an implant and to sabotage a tooth to force a return visit …. anyone got any opinions, similar experience ? MattKW: Sounds like you got a bit of a poor deal, sorry to hear that. There are good and bad people in all walks of life and at all levels. There are probably quite a few bad NHS dentists too, but it sounds like you have a good one that you're very happy with, so take it as a learning experience and have a stiff drink! Busybee: Paul I am sorry you had such a bad experience with an unscrupulous dentist.  You should make a formal complaint to the private surgery and it's worth paying your NHS dentist for a written report so that you can get some of the money you paid back from the other surgery.  You should complain to the general dental council if you make no progress.    I hope you feel much better and that you will take the advice of having regular hygiene appointments. PaulS: Thank you both. Things have progressed ...\n\nI had three unsolicited phone calls, one from the surgery, two from the dentist herself ... key phrases were \"that temporary repair, it might last a week, maybe a year, I really need to get back to it\", \"You will have to cut up all your food really small and put it directly to your back teeth to be able to eat\" and \"You will have to eat soft food only until I have completed my treatment\"\n\nI said that another dentist had told me that the reattachment of the crown was very good, un-phased she simply replied that it was just a temporary measure - she could not reply when I said that I thought all crowns were surely simply glued on\n\nA little on the offensive I said I was considering a formal complaint to the surgery, that got me a curt laugh and a \"see where that will get you\"; I gather she is the owner of the surgery. I said that I had taken advice of offering a type 1 diabetic a tooth implant; she said it made little difference\n\nI phoned the General Dental Council this morning and filed my complaint, my NHS dentist said he would happily provide any report I needed (free !) MattKW: You can ask that they no longer contact you. This is going beyond \"duty of care\" follow-up, and is straying into unsolicited marketing for which there must be some laws in the UK if they persist. Perhaps a Consumer Advise body could assist you.\nIf you ask for copies of the records, then it might show thta the health questionnaire was incomplete or ignored.\nImplants are fine in Type 1 diabetic patients as long as you have good control."

If I don't eat or press on the gums/tooth there is very minimal pain. There is no swelling or redness. What could this be? honestdoc: We cannot diagnose off of your information.

If you have any underlying conditions that causes bad breath, the extra scented toothpastes may only mask it temporarily.

Dry sockets rarely develop after upper extractions, and become apparent 3-4 days post-op with enormous pain, foul breath, and really bad taste. Rinsing after smoking won't lessen the risk of dry socket - it's the smoking products in the bloodstream that make a difference, not the topical effects. Nickb: Thanks for the reply.

    "title": "Pain/sensitivity in incisor after NON-DRILLING filling",
    "dialogue": "tendent: Hey all. New member here. I feel stuck and not sure what to do.\n\nIn May of this year, I saw my dentist for my twice-annual cleaning and exam. She said I had some staining on my left lateral incisor, and she was going to put in a filling as a preventative measure. Well, that turned out to be a HUGE mistake, because now, almost two months later, I'm experiencing DAILY pain in that tooth. It is a mild pain (2-3 on the pain scale, so more of an irritation than actual pain) that comes and recedes in waves. It is NOT sensitive to pressure/percussion, but there DOES seem to be some thermal sensitivity. However, this pain is NOT happening when I am eating or drinking--it's at random times throughout the day. As far as I can tell from my self-diagnosis, it's hurting whenever I expose it to air: by breathing in and out through my mouth, smiling, or speaking.\n\nI've also experienced a MASSIVE shift in my bite that seemed to occur overnight, about 1-2 weeks after getting the filling. Weirdly, it's not the tooth with the filling that's changed--that tooth doesn't even touch any of my other teeth when I bite down. But I can feel my front teeth knocking together when I close my mouth, and I sometimes have problems getting my molars to line up.\n\nI also occasionally feel an intense itching or restless feeling, like I need to chew something extremely crunchy to relieve it. And I've detected a slightly salty taste in my mouth around where that tooth is. Oh, and for the first week after getting the filling, it wasn't smoothed down AT ALL--it was a jagged mess. Now, it IS smoothed out, but I can still clearly feel the edges of the filling each time my tongue touches that tooth, and it's hard to avoid a front tooth with your tongue.\n\nNow, the dentist says that there is NO WAY the filling caused the sensitivity or the other problems. I got a second opinion, and that dentist said the filling was probably unnecessary and sloppily done (he could also immediately detect the edges of the filling when he did the exam), but he doesn't think it could be causing the sensitivity since (in his words) they didn't numb me with a shot when doing the filling, so they didn't etch my tooth. In fact, both dentists say the tooth appears perfectly healthy. I asked if it was possible there could be food getting trapped under the filling, and he said no. But he could not explain the pain I'm experiencing or how to make it go away. He said it could be referred pain, but that doesn't help me much.\n\nI should emphasize that I experienced NO PAIN OR SENSITIVITY in this tooth before the filling went in. I have receding gums, so sensitivity is nothing new for me, but I'm used to only hurting at meal times, not ALL DAY.\n\nAny clue what could be happening or how I can treat it? Also, is it worth asking again to see if they can smooth out the edges? MattKW: The variety of symptoms you describe do not fit into a recognisable pattern related to the work done on the tooth. Nor could your bite change that rapidly. There is a small possibility of referred pain, so further testing of adjacent teeth would be useful, even perhaps giving the symptomatic tooth a dose of local anaesthetic (short- and long-acting) to see what happens. tendent: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe variety of symptoms you describe do not fit into a recognisable pattern related to the work done on the tooth.

Thanks for the reply, but I can assure you that my bit DID change overnight. Maybe it's not the teeth themselves that are shifting, but rather something to do with my jaw, but SOMETHING is definitely changing. In fact, just yesterday, I felt my bite change after eating an apple--it was my right front teeth that were clacking together before, and suddenly, it was the left front teeth. It went back to normal by this morning. It's so weird.\n\nAs far as the other symptoms, I can appreciate that it doesn't make sense to be related to the work done, but what then? What's causing the pain, and how can I get rid of? MattKW: Beyond the scope of this type of forum. You should head back to your dentist."

Each filling is a two surface, resin based composite filling on a posterior tooth, and it is on bottom teeth.\n\nWhen I floss in between these two teeth I get some minor pain, especially when I pull the floss out. I only experience pain when I floss. There is no pain from chewing or when cold or hot comes in contact with the teeth. The pain seems to be less and less over time, but it is not disappearing. I haven’t told the dentist about this situation and I haven’t yet paid for the portion that my dental insurance did not cover. I no longer have dental insurance and I need to be very cost conscious in dealing with this.\n\nWhat should I do about this situation?

    "title": "Composite veneers on upper teeth only",
    "dialogue": "CompVeneers: Hi there,\n\nI'm 23 and have a relatively small gap between my two front teeth as well as a slight \"kant\" (I think it's spelled that way!). My dentist recommended invisalign to improve my smile - but after close examination then instead recommended composite veneers - but only on my 8 upper teeth.\n\nFrom what he's told me - there are no drawbacks and no dangers to getting composite veneers.\n\nMy aim with the veneers would be to make my smile look \"good\", or at least \"normal\". However, my dentist has also told me that there will be a slight colour difference between the veneers on my upper teeth, and my natural lower teeth. Won't this look odd and ruin my smile?\n\nI'd really appreciate your thoughts! Busybee: Can you post a photo of your smile?  \n\nComposite veneers are not drawback free.  To attach the material you have to etch the tooth enamel with a type of acid.   Despite whatever dentists tell you, the composite cannot be removed easily and your teeth will never be quite the same if you try to remove it.  It gets bonded to your teeth.   I'm not sure whether your dentist plans to have these lab made or to put them on freehand.  If the latter then you are basically reliant on the dentist being really talented at making teeth that look natural and attractive.  This is not a skill all dentists have.   Some dentists think something looks natural when it looks nothing like a real tooth.   \n\nIt is the least invasive cosmetic dentistry process you can have but it's not as simple as you have been told.  The next alternative would be porcelain veneers which require removal of almost half the tooth.    It's find to do all these things as long as you are aware of the risks and the fact that it is never going to be an untouched natural tooth again.  You may need retouches and that might mean changing them all to ensure a good colour match.   Eight teeth is a lot of work.    But the best thing about going down this route is that you can keep having it redone with minimal trauma to your teeth.  Whatever you do, do not be talked into porcelain veneers.  \n\nI honestly do not understand why your dentist is thinking of doing this using a different colour from your natural teeth.  That makes him sound unethical and inept.  If your natural teeth are darker then that would force you to bleach them going forward.  Perhaps that is his plan, because bleaching is a nice little earner.  \n\nThere is no risk free dentistry but if you go down the composite route find a dentist that is really experienced at this and is really good at using the technique.  Some dentists are gifted at this but they will have examples of their work.  Or you can just have one peripheral tooth done to see how it will look and how you feel about it.  There's not much risk to that compared with all eight. \n\nIf it were me then I'd find someone good and just have the two front teeth done and see how you feel after that.  If done well you may not want any more work.. MattKW: Show us a photo of your teeth. \nFull coverage veneers sometimes just make it more compolicated than necessary, and make the front teeth noticeably thicker. In many cases it is easy enough to do a quick mockup of the composites without using etchant. After you have a look to see if you approve of shape and colour, they are flicked off. Takes me 5-15 minutes. CompVeneers: Thank you for the responses!\n\nPictures of my teeth before & after mock ups below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice quoted for 8 veneers: £2,200 ($2,765)\n\nSince the original pictures, I have had whitening as recommended. \n\nMany thanks! Busybee: I prefer your natural teeth to the mock up.  Not only is yours a nice natural colour but the shape is normal too.  The lateral incisors are a little smaller that's all.  If I were you I would not let anyone talk you into having 8 teeth done. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with the canines and premolars.  The gap between the front teeth is tiny.    You don't need a bright white smile and composite is not the material to try to achieve that.    If you start having your canines veneered you could end up compromising your bite in future years.    Has the dentist said that he/she plans to cut into your natural tooth before placing these veneers?    If you have lab made veneers then it's normal to shorten the tooth (to strengthen the restoration) and to reduce the front so that the veneers aren't too bulky.  This is irreversible. \n.\nMy personal opinion is that your natural teeth look nice, the shape is fine and the colour looks good.  What is it that most bothers you about them? \n\nThe trouble is that once you start going down this route, if you don't like the result then you can't just change back, particularly if the dentist cuts into the tooth for a lab made veneer.   With lab made veneers you can't bite your nails or get the kind of cutting edge that a natural tooth has.   You can end up with sensitivity and they can chip over time.   \n\nI think you're being sold a pup.   Particularly in being told you need 8 teeth done!  The result does not look natural in my opinion and composite does not carry a long term guarantee for good reasons.  Porcelain veneers only have guarantees of five years.    This means having to go back and have it all redone every decade for the rest of your life.  You may eventually end up with crowns or root treatments from all the trauma.  You cannot turn back the clock once you touch your front teeth. \n\nIf I were you I'd go for a number of consults and get a few different opinions.   There are some very good dentists who can advise you on the least invasive way to give you the result you would like.  Go with the dentist who goes for the most conservative route. CompVeneers: Thank you so much for the detailed response, I really appreciate it so much!!!\n\nThe dentist didn't mention anything about cutting into any teeth. The veneers are composite and will be put on by the dentist all in one day. I've been told that the composite veneers will need to be replaced roughly every 5 years.\n\nThings that bother me about my teeth:\n- Tooth gap\n- Front upper teeth are not fully aligned with the rest of my face (dentist said they were at a slight \"kant\" but I can't seem to validate if this is a real word)\n- Shapes could be better - the mock up veneers look a tad fake but also look amazing to me!\n\nCan non-lab made composite veneers cause extra sensitivity? My teeth are already sensitive so I am quite scared about this. Busybee: Yes non lab composite can cause sensitivity to get worse.   The process requires the teeth to be etched with acid which can make the tooth more sensitive. Sometimes this fades, Sometimes it doesn't.  It depends on how well the process is carried out and what is wrong with the tooth to start with.  The worst case scenario is a root treatment if you end up with chronic sensitivity/pain by a badly done procedure.\n\nShapes could definitely be better.   Has anyone checked that you will not have interference in your bite from these changes?\n\nThe front tooth gap itself is easy to fix and you don't need veneers for this.  Just a bit of composite on both teeth bonded by someone who knows what they are doing.  It's also very cheap (less than £200).\n\nSo spending £2000 every 5 years for the rest of your life is ok?\n\nI would go for more consultations and focus on the gap in the central incisors if that is what bothers you.  If you think about it, having to have these replaced every five  years - what harm is there in starting with what bothers you most rather than having 8 healthy teeth tampered with? MattKW: I think you're going the wrong way about this. Bleach your teeth first as much as you can first, then add composite to close the gap between your centrals, matching in the colours of your newly whitened teeth. \n\nAny veneer added onto the front of a tooth makes it thicker, and that makes it much harder to clean; I have seen a number of sad cases with decay develop unnecessarily and catastrophically between the teeth. I see this as a particular issue with your lateral incisors which are slightly set back mesially.\n\nThe rounding of the tips on your canines is very questionable. Usually the way you chew won't allow this, and they will fracture off. How many times do you think the dentist will replace them for free before he gives up altogether?\nKeep It Simple Stupid - the KISS principle. Don't do more than you have to, taking into account all the risks. You cannot ever get natural teeth back once you go down the restorative path. CompVeneers: My dentist hasn't even mentioned anything about bite - I'm not sure what this is? I also have wisdom teeth still to come through but the dentist said it is a myth that these move the other teeth and so they will have no effect on the veneers. \n\nIs there any way to perfect the surface and shape of the upper central & lateral incisors without the veneers? If not, do you think it would be possible to just have veneers done on these to improve the look of my smile, without leaving my smile looking odd?\n\nReally appreciate all the help! MattKW: By \"bite\", I mean when you move your teeth through all the motions of eating, the canines with their sharp points often pass tightly against the lower canines. Bulking out the upper canines will sometimes stop this easy movement, and the veneers will get a lot of pressure and snap off.\nTrue about wisdoms - they have no effect on the alignment of front teeth. The action of chewing as we do in a hinge produces an anterior vector of force unless you take out ALL the molars! A bit drastic.\nAs you might perceive, I am conservative in my dentistry. I'm not keen on veneers because they are often for cosmetic reasons, rather than functional reasons or If you have really discoloured teeth then it becomes a psychological issue. They come with risks that i don't see often explained to laypeople - this is not like having false fingernails. Your teeth are normal colours, so at most I would suggest bleaching as a non-invasive  procedure. My teeth are off this scale at ~D4.\nIf you want to tidy up the appearance, then maybe consider simple orthodontics, Just be ready for life-long maintenance. CompVeneers: So overall, you heavily recommend against the procedure right? CompVeneers: Sorry - I've just re-read everything all in one go. \n\nThe recommendations are to:\n- Go for various consultations and see what other dentists recommend for improving the shape of the lateral incisors and also the shape/slant of my central incisors\n- Try to go for the most conservative treatment\n- Don't get all 8 upper teeth veneered\n\nI'd just like to say again - thank you SOOOOOO much for all your help and patience with me! I really, really, really appreciate it! You may have saved me years of trouble and thousands of £! Busybee: That sums it up.  Please let us know how you get on. CompVeneers: Received an ultimatum from my dentist, need to let him know by 1PM today!\n\nI asked four questions:\n\n1) Damage to natural teeth - I believe you said there would be no damage to the natural teeth from composite bonding (and damage would only occur if a dentist made a mistake, or something along these lines?). I was told that the teeth are etched with acid during the process and the \"natural teeth will never be the same again\" - and that as a result of this I'll always have to get veneers going forward - I wouldn't be able to go back to just having my natural teeth without veneers and them looking the same. Are there any guarantees or is there a safety net in case of this? \n\n2) It was heavily recommended to me not to have my canines and premolars veneered as \"there is nothing wrong with them\", my \"bite could be compromised\" in future years and that given the shape of my canines, veneers would be likely to frequently fracture off. My real issues are with the slant of my two central incisors, the gap between them and the shape of the lateral incisors. Would it look weird or sub-optimal to just have these done?\n\n3) I've been told that the acid etching can in some cases cause chronic sensitivity. Is there any insurance or guarantees protecting me if this were to be the case?\n\n4) Would you be able to do a mock up on the day of whichever teeth we go forward with - as the mock up on the three teeth looks great - but I still don't know how my real smile would look with the mock ups done on either side of my mouth?\n\nResponse:\n\n1: I mentioned no damage as I’m not drilling your enamel. Etched is needed for any kind of treatment of bonding nature. Whether for braces, ceramic or composite veneers or normal white fillings\nThe only guarantee we give is that if the veneers are chipped within 2 years of placement then free repair or replacement is available\n\n2- the reason we agreed on the 8 veneers was for slightly wider smile. You could only have treatment on your 4 front teeth and forget about other teeth, etch is still needed for bonding on those, \nYour centrals not only slanted but slightly misaligned therefore you need some sort of full coverage on one to align with others otherwise best is Invisalign to align first and need to go about 5-6 months and then just some edge bonding which you didn’t want in the first place.\nYour canines may need edge bonding \nThese veneers won’t compromise your bite.\n\n3- I haven’t had any patient who has experienced chronic sensitivity however again there is no guarantee for this as normal teeth could become sensitive for various reasons.\n\n4- further mock up could be done in addition to the complimentary one you had before \nIt would however be chargeable. \n\nPlease do let us know by 1pm today should you want to go ahead with your treatment as I have booked you for the entire 5 hours.  In case you would like to cancel or alter the appointment we need to hear from you by this time to avoid administration fee which is equal to your deposit. \n\nDoes this seem a reasonable response? Any recommendations on whether to cancel (which would leave me too embarrassed to ever go back to this dentist) or proceed with having a mockup with just 4 veneers and seeing whether they look good? Busybee: Hi, you should not be psychologically pressured to have treatment if you are still not sure.  We cannot make the decision for you. But it's perfectly reasonable to postpone such treatment if you are not ready to make a decision and you are not sure whether you are doing the right thing.  You should not feel embarrassed about doing that.  If you do not feel comfortable going back then how can you feel comfortable you will be able to communicate any concerns to this dentist?  You have already paid a deposit?   You said you already have sensitive teeth.  Is your dentist aware of that?  The dentist mentioned that no patient had \"chronic sensitivity\" which indicates some have experienced short term sensitivity.  Etch is not needed for invisalign as far as I am aware.  But that comes with other risks and the need to wear a retainer usually for life.  \n\nThere is no risk free dentistry so if you don't need any it's best to leave your teeth alone.  But if you do want something changed on your front teeth it is best not to rush that decision because you will be living with the results. CompVeneers: Phoned up and was quoted £35 for the mock up on each tooth so I've cancelled that appointment. Will book consultations with other dentists to see what they recommend.\n\nThank you so much for all your help! Feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders now ! Busybee: If you feel like a weight has been lifted then you have definitely made the right decision.    You should never feel pressured to have cosmetic work done on your teeth when you are not ready.     Please keep the thread going when you have updates with different opinions.  I'd love to know what they recommend and the outcome."

I don't drink soda or consume plenty of sugar.\n\nI've visited two dentists in order to get two opinions, the result is: one of them says I have \"only\" two cavities and the other one says I have eight cavities.\n\nhere are the teeth (X-RAY): (one of them says I have cavities in each one of them)\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1BrZeHy-FtjuRuD98wl33n0NONwbDfIJH/view\n\n\nalso, I had a root canal in tooth #26 18 years ago when I was 11 with an amalgam filling. the tooth hasn't been crowned yet. the tooth is fine, I have no symptoms at all, but both dentists say it has signs of inflammation. one of them says it has to be redone and then crowned and one of them says I can get the tooth crowned without performing a retreatment.\n\n\nYour wise opnion will be highly appreciated! MattKW: Those are not the appropriate X-rays to look for decay. You need to have perpendicular bite-wings of upper and lower teeth. You are displaying periapical films which tilt the image and are used for looking at root tips.\nThe 26 has a very poor Root Canal Therapy (RCT) and you are just very lucky you're not having any pain. At the minimum, the RCT needs to be redone, preferably by an endodontist, or extracted. Anyone who puts a crown on that in its current state is crazy. THELAD: thanks for your quick reply.\n\nthese are the X-rays both of the dentists used in order to diagnose cavities in my teeth, very strange. no one of them told me to get another kind of x-ray.\n\nIn relation to tooth #26, since I'm a young man I prefer not to get the tooth extracted and do everything I can in order to keep it. I will stop seeing the dentist who told me it's okay to crown it. what are the chances of a successful retreatment of this tooth and how long should I wait before crowing the tooth after the treatment? I'm very afraid of getting the tooth broken during the Root canal operation and having to get a dental implant already at the age of 29. :-( MattKW: Here's an example of bitewings attached. They are straight-on to the side of teeth.\nI don't know your chances for success with the 26. An endodontist is your best hope. THELAD: Thank you very much!"

    "dialogue": "Rachykins: Hello! \nI had a rather big filling done last week. The dentist told me at the end that it was quite a deep one. Since having it, I still generally have the exact same pain as prior to the filling being done maybe even a little worse? It doesn’t hurt to bite, there’s no instant reaction to hot or cold. It just seems to hurt intermittently on its own accord. Is it just a case of it will take a while to recover? \n\nI went back today to ask dentist to take a look but he seemed to think it was just going to take a bit longer to heal- no xrays were done though to check! It seems annoying that after thinking I was getting my pain sorted... it has amounted to the same or more pain! honestdoc: Unfortunately you may experience pain and or sensitivity after fillings...usually the deeper the filling, the more pain.  I tell people not to overwhelm the tooth with anything too cold for it may damage the nerve (pulp) of the tooth.  We can't predict the time it takes for the tooth to settle down.  If you have intolerable pain, that means the nerve is damaged.  If you have swelling around the tooth, it means the nerve died and became infected.  Both of those scenarios means you need a root canal, core filling and crown to save the tooth or extract the tooth.  Don't wait for the cavity to get too big to get it fixed. Rachykins: Thanks for your reply! It’s not excruciating pain, It’s not the kind of pain that would keep me awake at night. It’s just annoying but I’m an anxious person and do tend to let myself get transfixed by things if I know it’s not “perfect” \n\nIt’s settled down today in that it isn’t hurting as spontaneously throughout the day. It does hurt a little if I chew on it however. I will go back to the dentist in a few weeks if it still hasn’t settled. He did tell me that he filled it very close to the gum line which worries me that it’s maybe a bit too close. MattKW: After deep decay, particularly if there has been preceding pain, then there is greater uncertainty as to whether the nerve (pulp) will recover from the damage leading up to the filling, plus the damage we have to do in order to remove the decay. As long as you're not requiring regular painkillers, and it doesn't disturb your sleep, then you are going OK, and I would wait 2 weeks or unless there is worsening. The tooth might even \"die quietly\" and seemingly settle down, just to come back with a vengeance weeks or months later."

If so my bridge will be no good I guess. \n\nThanks for any advice you may give. honestdoc: Xrays would be more helpful.  I don't see a pontic so I don't think you have a bridge.   A root canal tooth usually is not strong enough for a bridge abutment and can fracture due to immense stresses placed on it. Jmb77: Thanks for the reply I am currently living in Germany and they seem to do things differently here i am still trying to figure it out i will attach a picture of my prosthetic. honestdoc: What you have is not a bridge (fixed partial denture) but a removal partial denture (you take in and out).

My Dentist didn’t think it was gingivitis and encouraged me to go my doctor. He then told me to go to my dentist!!! \n\nThey are red around the base of the tooth and very paid higher up. Ok, until recently I had gone through a period of depression and was barely eating anything - what I was eating wasn’t very nutritious - bread, cereal, chocolate! \n\nCould the gum issues be caused my malnutrition?

Have you had a recent hygiene appointment and do you floss? Annabela: Hi Busybee, I have swapped dentists and this dentist didn’t even  mention lichen Planus. To be honest, it feels different from that. She suggested I see a gastroenterologist, as, she thought it could be inflammation caused by my digestive system being inflamed too. After all, the mouth is the start of the digestive system. I do have haemorrhoids at the moment, but I doubt that could cause inflamed gums, \n\nMy diet has improved now and a recent blood test showed zero vitamin deficiency, no caeliac disease and no other issues \n\nI do floss, twice a day.

I've done it before but woke up with a really bad dry mouth. Busybee: I doubt it's any good for the health of the soft tissues in your mouth.   The surfactants can cause irritation even during normal use. MattKW: Teeth are not bone, so even if you have osteoporosis your teeth will be as strong as the day they came through your gums. Your bones could dissolve completely and your teeth will be unchanged.\nThere's no harm in leaving toothpaste on your teeth, and it is recommended for people with high risk of decay. But that would normally be with a high-fluoride toothpaste like Colgate Neutrafluor. \nYou imply that your teeth aren't strong - why is that? Lots of decay? Busybee: IMO if the dentist asked you to do this then he should provide mouthguards so that the stuff stays inside and on your teeth and does not irritate the delicate tissues of the mouth lining.   Anything else will wash off with saliva anyway so basically pointless.   If we were meant to eat toothpaste it would be on sale in the food section of the supermarket! MattKW: You can indeed go to the extra lengths that Busybee suggests if you want maximal effect, but that will cost you extra for the mouthguard, and is normally only used for patients with severe dry mouth (e.g. following damage to salivary glands). It is not \"basically pointless\"  to let it slowly dissipate in your mouth if you are a normal person; you will get added beneficial effect. But then, Bb is not a dentist, and doesn't study the literature (quick search!), so you have to take her anecdotal suggestions with a grain of salt. gary2019: I'm just getting a lot of cavities even when I have changed to regular water. My dentist did mention putting it in my mouth but that was when I used a weaker toothpaste, they recently gave me 5000ppm toothpaste.\n\nI do have retainers, could i keep the toothpaste inside of the retainers? (that is of course If I should use the toothpaste at all. MattKW: Yes, the retainers will work well as a reservoir. You might also consider using a remineralising paste like Tooth Mousse overnight in the retainers. Although I don't know for sure, I'd suggest using the 5000ppm toothpaste when brushing (at least 2x daily), then put a smear of Mousse in the retainers overnight. The Mousse is not a toothpaste, so don't apply on a toothbrush - it is usually smeared on by finger. The Mousse will help remineralise your white areas near the gumlines. If you follow this regimen (and a good diet), I'd like to see another photo in 6 mos please. Busybee: You should use it exactly as your dentist has advised.  If the dentist did not say to leave it on overnight then check with the surgery before doing this.  \n\nNobody here has examined your mouth and you will have filled in a full health history at the dentists so they will be best placed to advise you on how best to use what they have prescribed. MattKW: We have the photo, Bb, and that's enough for me to see decalcification from poor hygiene around the brackets. And of course, I'm a dentist whereas you're not, and shouldn't be giving out your untrained advice. A full health history has exactly what bearing on this case? gary2019: Matt should I be getting fillings immediately? For the holes seen on my teeth? Or wait until they become sensitive/painful? Because my dentist is well aware of the holes, but hasn't done anything. \n\nOne of my molars have actually started to become painful. Second bottom of the left of the photo (so my right) gary2019: And, can I floss more than once a day? Should I be flossing between fillings?  (I have been but it's been sensitive) Busybee: You should floss between all your teeth including the area circled.  Try to be gentle but thorough.   It's important to change angle so that you don't shove the debris up into your gums.  But you do need to pay attention to the gum area.   If it's sensitive perhaps you should try a different type of floss.  There are different thicknesses, waxed/unwaxed etc.     Your dentist should really refer you to a specialist at a dental hospital.  You should demand this. MattKW: There are some small cavities that I would treat now. From your photos they are teeth 13, 23, and 34 (FDI). But there may be more that I can't see. Floss at least once a day - the \"angulation\" is unimportant as is \"pushing debris up into the gums\", that's tosh from Bb. You must get the floss slightly under the gums - there is a pocket (sulcus) of 2-3mm you can penetrate. If you keep flossing and brushing the tenderness in the gums will subside as your gums become less inflamed. You can then find flossing is quite fast - you will soon be able to do your mouth in less than 60 secs. gary2019: I do floss daily already, I was just wondering if I can floss for more than 1 time a day? \n\nI got referred to the dental hospital a few months ago and I am guessing I am still in a queue to get seen about my front tooth that got a root canal. (smallest tooth with the red ring around it) I am just hoping it does not need removed or anything. It's still sore after root canal treatment. The dentist didn't do it under any antithetic either, she just told me to mention when I could feel her touching the root with the pins, whenever I told her I could feel it she stopped doing it. I think there was some miscommunication as it was not painful, I was just telling her I could feel it. So I am guess that's why there has been complications. \n\nShe said many roots in my teeth have grew quite sort, but she didn't mention if I could do anything about that myself, or if she was going to do anything about it. \n\nare root canal teeth suppose to have a crown on them? Do I currently not have a crown as there has been complications? Busybee: If I had a root canal I would want a crown to protect the tooth.  I'm sure the dentists have a converse opinion as that appears to be the case quite often here!  But I would want the tooth crowned.   It should be a good crown with a margin that fits well.   As this is your front tooth, I would have it done privately so that it looks nice.   The NHS is inflexible in material choices.\n\nYou should always be able to floss more than once a day. You should be able to floss whenever you want.  Get some advice from a hygienist on flossing method.  They are the experts.   Have you seen a hygienist or did your dentist give you what they call a \"scale and polish\"?  That's not my idea of professional cleaning.  A dental hygienist should be high on your list of dental self care.   They really know their stuff and it's worth paying for a proper appointment with one.\n\n I'm surprised at the method of carrying out a root treatment with no painkillers and relying on you to say whether you can feel anything.  It's not your fault if anything was badly done.  She is the professional you put your trust in.   Did she have imaging equipment?   Did she show you the x ray of the completed root canal?\n\nThere is nothing you can do if you have short roots.   But it should not mean that you will lose your teeth if you look after them.   There is no point in worrying about this because from what you have posted you are already doing your best to look after your teeth.   \n\nif I were you I would pay to have a good private dentist give an opinion on your dental work and dentition.    It should not cost a great deal.   You should also check where that appointment with the dental hospital has got to.  Make sure you are still on the waiting list.  Make that a priority. MattKW: Shouldn't have been done without local anaesthetic (LA); the length is determined from Xrays, and if it is done by \"feel\" then there is a high chance that it hasn't been completed to full length. Get an Xray of it.\nCrowns are nearly always recommended for back teeth (premolars and molars). They are not always beneficial for front teeth, especially lateral incisors because the preparation for the crown sometimes weakens the front tooth more than it strengthens it, and that's why dentists often have a contrary opinion to Bb on this forum - because we know more. That's a combination of training, experience, and further learning. I spent 4 hours on Sunday at the library (no distractions) going through dental literature. gary2019: Can a tooth that's been through root canal treatment become lose from the gum/wobbly? As that was another major concern I had. I was prescribed antibiotics and that done nothing. gary2019: As for the tooth mousse situation, I have got some called \"GC toothe mousse\" and wasn't sure how much to put in my retainer so I tried to put as little as possible around the entire retainer and it came out of the retainer when placing it on. This is what the end result was. I'm not sure if I'm suppose to just leave it in the retainer over night now when I sleep? For the mousse that escaped the retainer, I rinsed it out with mouthwash. Probably next time I will put a small amount of mousse on the teeth then put the retainer on MattKW: Yep, that's the general idea. Just leave it overnight. Given how expensive the Mousse is, then a minimum amount is all you need so it's not wasted. This could take months.Great taste for a medicinal product. gary2019: I was actually unable to keep it on overnight as there must be a little gap or something in my retainer therefore I couldn't stop swallowing as I was laying down. Is there an alternative way?"

I am totally convinced my teeth click when I push against my upper front teeth. I was told that teeth have a natural 'shock absorber' and by another one that basically is in my head. I am trying with extreme self control not to push behind these upper teeth with my tongue. It does not happen all the time. Can any body shed some light as to what to do? I feel insecure about writing this post but it truly has me a little freaked out. Thank you. Busybee: When you say you are pushing, what are you pushing with? Smiles15*: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhen you say you are pushing, what are you pushing with? My tongue. I push against the back of my teeth. They dont click all the time, but it freaks me out. Dentists say that not all teeth are permanently cemented in our gums. I was told that teeth have like a shock absorber. Thank you for responding."

    "title": "Mystery gum inflammation",
    "dialogue": "petecap: Would be grateful for any advice.\n\nI currently have the following symptoms: unusual gum tenderness, rapid and recent recession of the gum in the same area, odd taste in mouth, discomfort (sensation of gum compression) that wakes me up at night. I have seen two dentists and an endodontist in the last two weeks, none of whom have diagnosed any problem needing treatment. I am concerned that they are missing something (decay under the crown?) as I do not feel the symptoms I am experiencing are psychosomatic. I am posting here for advice as I'm concerned enough to be considering asking to have the crown removed on my own recognizance, I recognise this might risk killing the tooth.\n\nThe symptoms are around a ten year old PFM crown on a molar (live tooth that I think weakened due to poor brushing discipline and cracked on top after biting on something hard). It has had a large gap with the adjacent tooth for a while but this has been OK for years with active tooth cleaning after meals. Nowadays my brushing and flossing discipline is good and dentists comment on this at the annual checkups. I have a full set of teeth otherwise, no recent cavities although many old ones.\n\nAbout a month ago I got a seed stuck under this adjacent tooth and did not realize it for several days (floss and pick didn't get it out, interdental brush finally did). I had bad inflammation around the area and gum tenderness. This kind of thing has happened before but never as long and the symptoms have never been as bad. I started to find I had a metallic taste in my mouth on that side and the gum was painful. The gap between the teeth felt larger. Swishing mouthwash there feels uncomfortable. There is tenderness and discomfort around the gums in the area. Chewing is not painful.\n\nDental x-rays show no decay although the dentists caveat that they can't see decay if it is in the crown. The endodontist saw no sign of infection and suspects instead trauma from too vigorous teeth cleaning with picks and floss. A few days of being more gentle in cleaning has not changed anything. She did point out that the interdental papilla between the crown and the other tooth has disappeared - no dentist has pointed this out before and it matches my feeling that the space has recently become larger.\n\nI feel out of options to address this issue, I am doing very occasional salt rinses, brushing gently with fluoride three times a day, and applying chlorhexidine digluconate as both the dentists advised.  If the symptoms persist more than another week or two I strongly feel I will have no choice but to ask them to drill off the crown and see what is under there (would replacing it with gold be a stupid idea now that the tooth has been filed down for PFM? Dentists in my area, perhaps any area nowadays, don't seem to even consider gold, which I think is how I got the PFM crown to begin with.)\n\nAs I said, grateful for any advice. Frustrated that the dentists I have seen don't see my symptoms as a problem (or perhaps view it as likely to self resolve). How long would you wait to do something? Busybee: Your dentists are right to ask you to wait because if it's only been a couple of weeks that is not long enough to see whether it's something more serious.   These things can take a while to heal and settle.  In the meantime they can be incredibly painful and distracting.\n\n If you have a problem with the gum then it is not a good idea to change a restoration until it has resolved.  If you have overdone the cleaning and flossing then you could have injured the gum.  It might recover but it doesn't grow back.\n\nI don't use mouthwash and I don't think it's helpful for sore gums.  If chewing isn't painful then it's not likely to be the tooth.   It might be the tooth but there are tests to check and if you have seen more than one professional I am sure they have done these.    I can feel like it's the tooth when it is just the gum area.  The gum area is really super sensitive. \n\nif you have an infection it could take up to two to three months to show on x ray.\n\nGold restorations have pluses and minuses.  They are really strong but they can develop a margin and buckle (letting decay in).\n\nAre you taking vitamin C or ensuring you eat plenty of vit C rich foods to help healing?  \n\nMaybe you could post a photograph of the area? MattKW: It's probably best to remove the crown. It sounds like you've had a good run with it but palliative treatment isn't working anymore. It may be as simple as re-establishing a good contact with the adjacent tooth, but that will need a crown. Having previously had a PFM, then it is best to replace with another PFM or ceramic. A gold will not add any advantages but cost considerably more because of the thickness you will now need. It is incorrect to say that gold restorations (sic) can develop a margin and buckle - that would be a soft gold alloy not used for crowns. There is no evidence that intake of additional Vit C will help you in this situation; a waste of time and money - replace the crown. petecap: Hi Busy and Matt,\nThanks for the replies. I meant to say periodontist, not endodontist.\nI will post pictures but they are poor quality ones I took myself, as the dentist did not take intraoral pictures.\nI will discuss crown replacement with the dentist then, thanks for the tip about crown types. I had read that gold crowns are generally more durable, is that when they are designed thinner from the outset, taking advantage of greater tooth retention then? Wish I had known/thought about this ten years ago but I did no research at the time.\nQuestion, if decay takes a few months to show up on X-ray, is that the time it takes for the decay to spread outside the area covered by metal? In which case would that mean it has already spread inside, possibly to the root? Or does decay in this situation generally start in the uncovered area that can be seen on X-ray?\nI think I do have a diet with enough fruits and vegetables.\nI do however have sinus issues that mean I sometimes wake up with my nose blocked, mouth open and dry -- I guess that could have exacerbated the gum issue, and the sinus issues might be worth treating as well?\nThanks again, really appreciate both of you taking the time."

    "dialogue": "gary2019: Hello,\n\nI writing this forum as I have just noticed a horrible lump or something right at the bottom of my mouth near my tongue. I don't think it's an ulcer as i've had it for years now, it sticks out now and then for about an hour and they just goes and comes back weeks later? I really cannot explain it.\n\nWhat should I do? What is it? Is it an ulcer? Can they last for years? Busybee: A salivary gland stone? honestdoc: I'm stumped as to why you had it for many years especially if you get it for only an hour and it goes away.   If it is a stone, a noticeable size will show up on x-rays.  I don't have all the information to make a good diagnosis.  Do you eat certain foods that can cause this reaction?  I'm suspecting an autoimmune response or irritation/traumatic response.  According to the first image, you may have a cavity on YOUR Lower Left molar (opposite side of the lesion). gary2019: No foods cause the reaction, I was just sitting on my computer and noticed a serve sharp pain under my tongue so I looked into the mirror and noticed that. When I mentioned the hour part I meant that it actually inflates and becomes really painful, but it hasn't done that since I posted this. It's just really small and non-painful anymore. I don't know what caused it to be so serve at points but I had to grab the camera immediately cause it looked like it was going to pop by itself. I didn't even know that it looked like what it does until the night I posted to the forum as I looked into the mirror. Previously before I thought it was just a vein that was bothering my mouth now and then. Yes I do have a cavtiy on my left molar which is really sensitive when brushing. I'll have to get a filling for that. My dentist is aware of many holes I have in my teeth but seems to only be giving me fillings if it is necessary such as if my teeth are in pain or sensitive. I mean, I thought it was important to get fillings in every tooth with a cavity I have right now, including the ones that are not sensitive or painful to avoid the holes enlarging but I think my dentist is not doing it as it's on the NHS. But she also put me on 5000ppm toothpaste, I don't know if that can just turn the black spots in my teeth white, or fix them, or if I need fillings. gary2019: I've just noticed on the other side of my mouth another one of those spots things. I have confused myself. It has been on my left side of the mouth (photo below) for years, but only just started appearing on my right side. frequently, or possible a long time. I've never actually noticed until I looked. I use to just assume they were veins.. gary2019: And as for my right side of the mouth, the first image, it now looks like the image I just posted. It's became no longer painful and it's colour has blended into my mouth but it is still there as I can feel a bump, but it will not leave. honestdoc: It appears as normal anatomy. gary2019: But what is causing it to appear like the first image I posted every few weeks? The bump is permanently there, but turns into the top image every few weeks which is confusing. Busybee: It could be a reaction to the new toothpaste.  I've had to change pastes myself for that reason.  Speak to your dentist about whether there are alternative toothpastes you could try to see whether the problem goes away."

    "dialogue": "cloa513: Hi, I live in Japan with my wife and child. I am Australian. I went to dentist on recommendation of my wife- I have seen others. This one has CT and an endoscope. The employee 30's dentist (the owner is older and they have quite a few treatment rooms) found that I needed an interdental filling (I later post a scan of the photos that they printed for me which are just OK quality) and it is going to need some exploration. That dentist is going to use his headset magnifier not the endoscope- I think it does 6 times magnification. My wife doesn't like the place as they keep to time and so likely are pushed to not do the best. I could maybe see the best doctor that will cost a lot- we don't have private health insurance. Please advise how important is it I get the best. How long should I search for a dentist? Busybee: Not good to rush such work.  Can you ask your dentist whether you can pay a little more for a long appointment? MattKW: Don't post low-res scans of photos up here, get digital copies (TIFF or JPG). \n\nI think you mean microscope, not endoscope.\nInterproximal decay is assessed from Xrays, not by exploration. An exploration suggests drilling when going interproximally. There are certain guidelines for considering intervention - this one is used at Sydney Univ where I tutor.\nKeeping to time is not a bad thing in itself. It can demonstrate that they have good time management and have learnt the time required for each procedure. It's not always perfect, but even students are assessed for time management. People time manage their lives and work every day. cloa513: And what if your dentist don't give you digital copies? I'll scan to high as quality of the pictures that I was given. The quality of the pictures is same what they showed on their screens.\nSure microscope- I didn't know that usage dental microscopes exist or look like.\nNo- he definitely said (by translation from Japanese and pictures) exploration- digging out weakened surrounding teeth to complete the gap for filling. As I said they already did a computer assisted tomography.  Keeping to time is good when the task is well defined but what if the task is being defined as you do it? Anyway we are probably going to change dentists but I still need consider cost versus benefit. MattKW: If they can put it on their computer monitor, then they have the ability to give digital copies. Do what you can.\nDecay is not diagnosed from CAT scans - that's for larger structures like roots of teeth. Standard dental Xrays, about 30mm x 35mm are used for fine detail of decay and the type of shot is called a bitwewing.\nThe task can be defined from the xray. Everyone does it. I plan the treatment into convenient periods of time, typically in increments of 10 minutes. A standard filling will take 30mins from start to finish. cloa513: They did a dental X-ray too after examination and before cleaning. That dentist was keeping exactly to time- I started at my time of 4:30 pm. My wife quizzed that dentist with dental medicine level awareness and he wanted that conversation to stop. My wife just did her own research for own situation. cloa513: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\nDon't post low-res scans of photos up here, get digital copies (TIFF or JPG). \n\nI think you mean microscope, not endoscope.\nInterproximal decay is assessed from Xrays, not by exploration.

He said yes and then didnt give me them. I took photos. Please confirm I have cavities since my wife couldnt see them. MattKW: Can't see anything of a photo of a monitor. Since they are digital images, every Xray software has the ability to export them to a flash drive etc as a JPG or TIFF file. You'll have to ask again. cloa513: I saw another dentist- he graduated from the best dental private university- and he said I don't need fillings. I said the full tooth is pre-C1 and the interdental is probably C1 but shallow. Maybe the software has that means but I would be loathe to let an unknown flash drive to connect to my expensive computer system and he doesn't have one for me. MattKW: He had a few options: \n\nBurn it onto a CD for you\nTake your USB and scan it with his antivirus or format it\nGive you one of his old flash drives. I must have about 10 lying around the place.\nAnyway, sounds like you're finally satisfied; good luck."

I bought a Waterpik at my dentist’s suggestion and I feel like maybe I caused this to happen so I stopped using it. Any thoughts? honestdoc: With a conventional 3 unit bridge, the dentist will need to drill on the 2 abutment teeth.  The drilling can cause a lot of sensitivity if the nerve/pulp/root canal is still intact.  If your bridge feels cold, then the nerve is still good.  Avoid overwhelming it with excessive cold because it can damage the nerve. Orizz: I only feel the sensitivity when I brush my teeth and especially floss under my bridge.

Now, after having a root canal, I have become very worried about my teeth's current state. Is it too late for some of my teeth to last forever now? Are they already destroyed? \n\nI have had MANY fillings now, I'd have to say around 10 just from guessing. \n\nIn the last year, I have begun to brush my teeth twice a day using an electric tooth brush, and have begun flossing as I never use to. My dentist has started prescribing me 5000ppm tooth paste, and instead of drinking coke I have began to only drink 0 sugar flavoured water. \n\nI have also attached a file with many questions about different areas of my teeth.

I went to the dentist and she said that x-rays are clear, not cavities or infection. She thinks i need to put a crown on the tooth since the filling is too big. But I am wondering - if I put a crown on a problem, how will it solve it? Or when she does a crown, she will take out the filling and clean the inside? Will the crown help it? What if I need a root canal and I have a crown on the tooth? Why is there nothing on the xray? Can it be cavity under the filling that we cant see? I do not want to pay for crown if it doesnt solve the problem, but this constant ache doesnt let me live normally and focus on other things. Thank you!!! Busybee: Your symptoms do not sound good.   Does it hurt after eating, in the morning when you wake or is it all the time?  Has your dentists done various tests to check whether you can feel hot/cold, whether there is lingering pain after putting pressure on (signs of a crack) or knocking it gently?   Can you post a photo of an x ray here? olgadowning: It’s kind of just aching all the time. It doesn’t react to hot or cold but when I floss on one side it’s hurting and if I put pressure on the gum on one side I can definitely feel it. Unfortunately I don’t have X-rays , they are at the dentist. What could it be and what can fix it? And why X-rays are clear? Thank you ! Busybee: If you ask the dentist they can usually email you the x rays.  But may be too early to see anything on x ray.  An infection doesn't always show up when symptoms start. olgadowning: Do you think my dentist is right by suggesting a crown? Or should I go for root canal?

Besides I have been suffering from migraines all my life and when I have migraine my teeth hurt as well. But this time it is separate from my migraine Busybee: Could be a bite problem.  Has your dentist discussed that possibility?  Has your dentist suggested a night guard to see whether the pain is better in the morning after using one?  Perhaps you already wear a night guard? olgadowning: She checked my bite, seemed fine... I do know that I grind my teeth and probably clench. I tried over the counter night guard for 1 night only for now. Do you think it would be aching all day because of grinding/clenching?  and do you think I should get rid of that old big filling and put a crown? MattKW: I can't even start to reply unless you put up at least 2 types of Xrays:\n\nA standard dental showing between the teeth (a bitewing)\nA standard Xray showing the tips of the most likely tooth (a periapical)\nA full mouth would also be useful (an OPG) Busybee: I think it's very important you have a proper diagnosis before you have any radical work done.   Your teeth can hurt all day if you grind/clench.  You can also have headaches from it and all sorts of other aches and pains.   How are your gums? Do you have any sensitivity?"

It's no longer red, swollen or has any pus coming out. The tooth appears to be straight and there's room for it to come through. It's partially covered by the gum, about 50% visible. \n\nI wasn't experiencing any pain after the infection cleared up but it's suddenly come back about a week later. It's no where near as severe as when it was infected but still not very nice. I have no other symptoms and otherwise feel fit and healthy. \n\nIs this pain normal and should I just take painkillers and make sure I keep it clean or is it a sign I need to get back to the dentists as soon as possible? Is a bit of pain just part of wisdom teeth coming through? Busybee: I had a lot of pain when my wisdom teeth were coming through and it was there for a while as they were coming through the gums and it took a long time for them to fully erupt.  I didn't even know what was happening at the time.  I was 21 and was having terrible headaches.    I didn't have an infection and they were fine in the end (not impacted)  If your dentist has not suggested removing them then they cannot be impacted so probably nothing to worry about.  If you get a fever or start to feel nausea or feel faint then go back to your dentist.  These days they suggest removing them. MattKW: It's very rare that wisdom teeth erupt into a functional and cleansable position. You don't say what the dentist said at the time. It's unwise to wait for pain, as with any health condition. You need it assessed and the pros and cons explained.\nWhat's your age, and do you have an Xray to show us?

The dentist said there was a localised infection and cleaned it up and basically just told me to keep it clean and hopefully it will clear up. They said they don't remove wisdom teeth likely and didn't prescribe antibiotics. Didn't take any X-rays. I'm 27.\n\nThe pain has now totally vanished but I can still taste some fluid which is obviously draining. The inside of my cheek appears slightly swollen. If there's no pain I'm not sure it's considered for an emergency appointment so not sure what to do!? Busybee: Make a routine appointment to check all is ok and then do as your dentist advises. Busybee: I am not sure where you are based, but in the UK the National Institute of Clinical Excellence has the following guidance which advises leaving wisdom teeth in place if they are not diseased or causing a problem to the dental health of the patient.  I am not aware that this guidance has changed since 2000 : \n\n\"The practice of prophylactic removal of pathology-free impacted third molars should be discontinued in the NHS.\n\n1.2 The standard routine programme of dental care by dental practitioners and/or paraprofessional staff, need be no different, in general, for pathology free impacted third molars (those requiring no additional investigations or procedures).\n\n1.3 Surgical removal of impacted third molars should be limited to patients with evidence of pathology. Such pathology includes unrestorable caries, nontreatable pulpal and/or periapical pathology, cellulitis, abscess and osteomyelitis, internal/external resorption of the tooth or adjacent teeth, fracture of tooth, disease of follicle including cyst/tumour, tooth/teeth impeding surgery or reconstructive jaw surgery, and when a tooth is involved in or within the field of tumour resection.\"\n\nhttps://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta...he-extraction-of-wisdom-teeth-pdf-63732983749\n\nIt is considered that where there is no evidence of disease, the risk of undergoing anaesthesia in the routine removal of wisdom teeth outweighs any benefit to the patient.  It is also considered a waste of money to routinely extract wisdom teeth and that there is no health benefit from doing so.  This is the UK guidance.  Other countries have different approaches and it's a controversial topic. MattKW: There is strong opposition to the NICE Guidelines from the dental fraternity, and some of the relevant parts of the detailed concerns by the RCS (2014) are:\n\n\" [NICE] has only delayed necessary surgery with the average age of patient at surgery rising from 23 years to-32 years; \nIt has not reduced the prevalence of M3M surgery (only delayed it) ;\nIt has resulted in significant damage to second molars due to caries (and resultant patient harm);\nThe charges associated with nonoperative management of asymptomatic, disease-free M3s will exceed the charges of operative management;\nThis evidence is sufficient for international Guidelines (Scandinavian, German and US) to have been amended in the last 12 months.\"\nPersonally, I see the NICE Guidelines as a stupid retrograde step in public health that should never have been implemented, and appears to have been embraced by bureaucracies more concerned with supposed cost efficiencies than health. \n\nDo you have an Xray to show us?"

    "dialogue": "oldtonew: Now just curious if something like this can be possible. I'll explain below ( top front teeth, numbered with #4 and #5 being the center 2 teeth - between them is the center line of my face - that should give an idea of what teeth they are )\n\nLeft > 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 < Right\n\n#1 - damaged by cavity on a side but otherwise in relatively good condition ( root wise I mean )\n\n#2 - was prepped 5 years ago for a crown, not finished, had a root canal that remained opened, damaged ( one doctor thinks it needs to be taken out, one thinks the root might be saved depending on what they find once they go in )\n\n#3 - was finished 5 years ago, has a crown, and a metal pivot supporting the crown - have no problems with it, no pain, seems to be standing firmly in place\n\n#4 - prepped 5 years ago for crown - never finished - root canal, left open, damaged ( 99% needs to be taken out - already got this diagnosis from 2 different doctors )\n\n#5 - same as #4 - 2 docs tell me it needs to come out completely\n\n#6 - same as #3 - in relatively good condition though this is the area where i got inflammations in the past few months - though doc tells me it's because of the ones adjacent to it since they're exposed - the crown is firmly in place, have no pain on pressure or anything\n\n#7 - same as #2 - though doc seems pretty sure the root can be saved\n\n#8 - no work on it, still has nerve, but outer layer completely gone, however plenty of tooth left above the gum line so most likely root can be saved.\n\n#9 - no work on it, still has nerve, half of it cracked and fell, but root is there and shouldn't cause issues\n\nSo ... my question is simple - I've already asked a friend of mine, known her for over 10 years, she's a dentist, practices and all that ( she started the work on me but since i freaked out and stopped going she didn't get to finish - the reason i don't go to her is i'm afraid, i trust her completely but she works in a small clinic and that IV sedation from this other big clinic is too sexy to overlook ) - she looked at my x-ray, she looked in my mouth and according to her yeah, i can get a large bridge put in for all 9 teeth. But extra opinions never hurt.\n\nSo ... as explained above ... assuming I have as follows Left > 1root 2missing 3root 4missing 5missing 6root 7missing 8root 9root < Right - can a bridge like that work ?\n\nI took the absolute worst case scenario where all the teeth I started working on years ago need to be taken out but as I said #7 for example is a good candidate for being saved - the root i mean, and there is a chance i might even save root #2 as well.\n\nI'm sorry for the long message but can't get valid opinions without all the details and to be honest ... my appointment is on Friday and it's gonna be an initial appointment, no work to be done ... but I'm already kinda freaking out about the whole thing that I'm about to embark on and knees are weak and all that ... my response to this is information. Get as much information as I can. Somehow it helps. So that's why I'm here. Just looking for opinions.\n\nYes, I know that nothing beats an X-ray and a close look so that's gonna be the final decision, not gonna pester the doctor based on what I read online, no worries.\n\nTo be honest - this is more of a \"is this possible\" kind of thing. Because wherever I see, I only see 3-4-5 teeth bridges, rarely more than 5.\n\nYes - implants are the plan for the long run but right now no money for them, and also ... that's a huge thing for me. I'm simply not prepared for something like that right now. I'd like to first do this, then a few months from now, save some more money, go again, get sedated, and do some cavities and fix teeth on left side, then same thing a few months later and fix teeth on right side. The hope is to get them all in a semi-functioning state over the course of the next year. And after that, with renewed forces, and bank account, to go for implants maybe in 1-2 years from now. \n\nThey're never gonna be perfect, nor 100% functional, but I'd like to get them to a point where I don't have to worry about inflammations and infections and them breaking down, and where I can kinda eat without doing gymnastics with my tongue.\n\nAlso ... it would be nice if I could talk to other people. 5-6 years of being locked up in the house, mumbling just a few words because I have no front teeth, no relationship, no social life. I wake up, I work, I go to bed - that's been my life ... it's not been easy.\n\nEDIT: if it makes any difference - as bad as they are above the gum line ... my roots are very deep, and very fixed. absolutely no problem with mobility or anything like that. Despite them being damage above the gum line, signs seem to point towards strong roots. \n\nAlso - no issues whatsoever with them except 2 inflammations in recent months, caused apparently by tooth #5 which needs to come out.\n\nI know, it's amazing to me that I'm not in horrible pain considering how destroyed my mouth is. But I'm pretty sure if I don't start fixing them, I'm gonna reach the land of horrible pain soon enough. Fun times ahead. MattKW: The primary reason that long bridges are not attempted is that there are technical difficulties when making them (distortion, shrinkage) that make it almost impossible to get a good fit on all teeth simultaneously. It can be done, but it would take a highly skilled dentist with a highly skilled lab, and it would cost you $$$.\nAnother reason is that you want to make a bridge that goes around a curve and effectively glues all the teeth together in a single bridge. This creates uneven biting forces and usually the bridge loosens off one or two teeth over time; then the whole bridge fails.Teeth work best as single units; bridges change that arrangement.\n\nFinally, bridging over teeth with RCTs is very risky. oldtonew: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\nThe primary reason that long bridges are not attempted is that there are technical difficulties when making them (distortion, shrinkage) that make it almost impossible to get a good fit on all teeth simultaneously.

As for the doctors there ... I haven't seen any kind of ratings or whatever ... but I would say this chain of clinics is one of the top 3 in the country. A rather famous doctor, at least nationwide, leading the clinics and they do all sorts of cutting edge stuff - at least comparative to all other clinics in the country. ( note: I'm not in the States )\n\nAs for #2 ... to be honest I am fully prepared for it not lasting too long. As I mentioned - I accept that it might be tricky and I might not get more than a few years out of it. Also I am fully aware that my days of biting into anything are long gone. Small pieces, straight to chewing from now on. \n\nAnd #3 ... have to admit ... did not know that. I assumed that since you can do crowns over treated roots, you can also do bridges. good to know. \n\nBut I do understand all your points and they're very good points. In which case ... would you see any option for me that doesn't include implants right now ? So ... assuming it's a no-go on the full single bridge ... is there a chance to do several smaller ones for example ? \n\nAs I said ... I'm just trying to work my courage up somehow ... again, fully realize none of this means anything until the doc sees me tomorrow and then sees my x-ray and does a proper analysis of the whole thing. MattKW: Wait until tmoro, tell me what they say, and put the Xrays up here pls. I've given you 3 good reasons why I wouldn't do it. Any single one of those reasons should make you very wary. oldtonew: So .. went and looks like I have no choice but to go through the whole implant thing. At least in my case. Looks like there are some issues with my bite so that needs to be adjusted. It's all very complicated ... it was just too much information.\n\nEventually just decided if I'm gonna do it - might as well commit to the whole thing. Next week I'm gonna get them cleaned since there's some tartar deposits on one side - the side I've not been using and they'll have like 2-3 different doctors to look at me and see which roots can be saved and which ones need to be taken out ( one endo something, one surgical and another one I think that deals with crowns or something like that ) since over the course of the treatment apparently I'll have 6 different doctors working on me - saw their names on the treatment plan they gave me.\n\nAnd I'm just gonna have to commit to do the entire mouth. From one side to the other, they'll adjust my bite, I'll do the implants, get rid of bad wisdom teeth and basically do everything.\n\nSeems that while there's a lot of work to be done - apparently it's not all hopeless. This doctor lady seemed very confident that if we do everything right I will have full use of my mouth and they'll also be nice to look at.\n\nGood news is they can put me to sleep through some of the more heavy duty stuff, they also have some kind of gas sedation which they claim will relax me ... so ... hopefully i will be able to manage my fears.\n\nBut yeah ... a crap ton of money and it will probably take 6-12 months to do depending on my finances ( could be done faster but I just don't have the finances to do it all in just a few months ). Right now I only have money set aside to cover almost half of it.\n\nOn the one hand it sucks ... but on the other ... I was gonna have to do it anyway ... might as well do it all in one sitting than spread it out over a few years.\n\nI could quite literally build a small house, maybe not finish it fully - but still, with the money it's gonna cost me )\n\nBut hey ... my mistakes, my poor choices ... I should be the one to suffer and pay for it all so can't blame anyone else but myself.\n\nSo ... that's the conclusion ... and the plan ... now begins the work.\n\nEDIT: I don't mean do the whole mouth in the sense that they'll take everything out. No, just a few extractions where needed, and implants and the rest will be fixed either by fillings where possible, or crowns where needed. But they all need a bit of attention and I have about 13 teeth that require heavy work ( either extraction/implant or crown )"

    "dialogue": "james2019: Hello\n\nMy frontteeth were cracked 2-3 years ago i decided to change that and went to some dentists. They told me that first id have to change my bite because otherwise the veneers wont last long. \nOn january 2019 I started an invisalign treatment to close my open bite. Everything worked out well and the doctor said that if i agree the treatment would be finished. My teeth are quite straight now but it doesnt look really asthetic. He sent me to the veneers specialist (at the same office). I showed him some pictures of what result id like to get. \n\nHe said that my front teeth are too wide (from an asthetic point of view) Especially the right one, he said that we would have to take about 2mm of it and with the help of veneering using the space to make the small teeth on the right a bit wider. So he suggested 4 veneers on the upper front.  I know that the width should be about 80% of the length. With me its about 1:1. On the next appointment another specialist was there and he was not a big fan of this option to make it smaller. \n\nSo the specialist thought about doing another invisalign treatment to make the front teeth a bit slimmer and move the other teeth more to the middle. I have invisalign full (so i wouldnt have to pay for another treatment) and the attachments are still on my teeth because we are not sure yet about how to continue. \n\nAre some dentists around here? I would really appreciate your feedback to these issues. My teeth are super important to me and id love to have a 1 of a 100 smile but i think its quite difficult with my situation.\n\nI also uploaded an exemple of a smile id like to get. Busybee: The width of your teeth looks totally normal to me.  The smile you would like does not look natural.   It looks like a comic book character.  \n\nit's up to you if you want to do this to your teeth, but bear in mind that veneers require the removal of a fair bit of tooth which you cannot reverse.  They require far more maintenance than alternatives.  They may need replacing in 7 to ten years as they can chip.  The gum can also recede.  You will need hygienist appointments regularly to keep your cosmetic work clean and prevent decay.   Veneers will also change the shape of your face, may be thicker than your current teeth, may cause dryness of your lips and sensitivity.   You may notice a change in your speech and pronounciation.  You may no longer be able to nibble or bite into apples with confidence.   The material used is not quite the same as enamel and  won't feel quite so strong.   Most importantly you may have all this work done and not be 100% happy, but you won't be able to go back to what you have now.  \n\n If I were you I'd keep the current width, which looks great and just have composite bonding (which does not require removal of any dental enamel).   \n\nYou may think this is what you want now, but I am just letting you know all the risks and problems you may encounter following the work.   So that you make an informed choice. \n\nI'm not a dentist but I had serious problems with veneers that a dentist talked me into.    They are not a magic solution.   If I could go back and change one thing in my life it would be agreeing to have veneers fitted. MattKW: That desired look is very feminine and \"American\"; they like long narrow crowns. It would look unusual on a bloke.\nThe width of your central incisors are ever so slightly wider than the \"ideal\" compared to the adjacent teeth. I personally would strongly advise you against any treatment that involves damaging your teeth. The tips or your teeth may be broad, but so is the gumline width, and that can't be changed with veneers. \nWhat type of specialists are you consulting with, pls?"

Of working with paedontists for over 35 years, I have never heard of a mishap.\nAntibiotics will only settle it for a while - don't keep giving repeated antibiotics or one day they won't work and you could have a real medical emergency on your hands and a child in extreme pain. You can't easily arrange an emergency GA for a child at an instant's notice. \n\nYou won't get a tooth out of a 5yo without numbing; they are by no means loose and can be surprisingly tough with a full set of roots."

During a routine check-up I told him I had sensitivity to air blown over a tooth and it being pressured/examined. The tooth has a bridge built on it. The dentist put floss under the bridge where the (adjacent) tooth is missing, then wiggling the floss back and forth he was able to go through the tooth (the one having sensitivity, holding the bridge) and come out on the other side of that tooth! In other words, the tooth under the bridge/crown has decayed completely! X-ray didn't show anything. MY question is: how is it possible that the tooth has completely decayed and I did not experience much pain or other signs, and my dentist has not noticed it either during regular check-ups at 3 month intervals?

I am 23 boy. 5 months ago I was eating and noticed two lumps on my sublingual gland. They are invisible.  I can only touch them with my tongue. The lumps located in the right and left. These days. The one on the right got a little bit bigger and it seems like two combined. The lumps are painless now.\nAdditional informations\nI was taking antihistamine 3 months before I noticed  the lumps.\nI have wisdom teeth.\nThanks in advance. See your dentist as soon as possible to make sure what is it? If general dentist can not recognize it, he will refer you to Maxillo-Facial surgeon or Oral Medicine specialist preferably in your state's Dental school. Below your tongue there are sub-lingual glands, most probably something wrong with pumping saliva from glands  into your mouth. Stone in the glands can cause this swelling. It could be other reasons. Don't be scared it is solvable problem just have to confirmed what is it and why is it? There is specific treatment for this. Good luck."

Yes, it is related to wisdom tooth, in most cases wisdom teeth now a days limited or no space on the jaw or the tooth is coming in a wrong alignment with other teeth in front of it. Your dentist needs to take an X-ray to find is there enough space on the jaw to accommodate it and is it coming in right alignment with other teeth or not? If there is not enough space on the jaw or not aligning correctly then this WISDOM teeth needs to EXTRACTED if not it will keep bothering you with pain,swelling, bad breath. So please let this tooth be checked by a general dentist."

Mohammad: Need to be checked by your dentist, if it is insignificant chipping then slight trimming/ smoothing is needed if not over the time your check/ tongue/ lower lip close the chipped tooth surface can cause irritation and ulceration if it is significant chipping then it needs to be restored by tooth colored filling to prevent further chipping or developing sensitivity over time!!

It's looking better than it did, but still wondering if it's on the right path to healing as I'm still taking Advil and Tylenol throughout the day and icing it to relieve the pain.  The \"white/grey\", which I'm told is normal, continues right against the last tooth.\nI'm also wondering why the back ( where my wisdom tooth was removed years ago) has some damage as well.  The dentist told me it was a complicated extraction, and it took some drilling and about half an hour before it was finally out. \nIt doesn't feel like a dry socket even though I have that black hole but it's definitely one of the most painful things I've gone through. honestdoc: Your 2nd molar extraction site looks good.  The \"white/grey\" discoloration is normal epithelial repair tissue.  Have your dentist keep an eye on the small bump on the 3rd molar area under the cheek side.  More times than not, the bump will even out.  If not, the bump may not get adequate blood supply for repair and may present as a bothersome \"skin tag\" depending on the size and symptoms may or may not need to be removed.

Rox: Thank you, I truly appreciate the advice/ feedback... I've already been to see my dentist twice since the extraction and I'll definitely keep an eye on that little bump.   I just can't believe the amount of pain this is causing.   That's why he said everything looked ok but he'd feel better if I took the antibiotics,  which has helped with the swelling and the pain a little bit so far. honestdoc: I hesitate to prescribe antibiotics due to increased resistance potential.  Lower molars are more difficult thus more traumatic to extract due to tougher anatomic bone.  Expect more down time with the healing process. Rox: He was hesitate as well but since he couldn't really explain or see why I was in so much pain,  he said he felt better if I took them.  I really dislike being on them but haven't taken any in years so figured better safe than sorry.  I didn't have any issues with past extractions, 4 wisdom and another back molar on the right side.   I have a high pain threshold so I'm really surprised at how much pain this has caused.  This is 8 days afterwards and I still need pain relievers about every 6 hours, my cheek is still slightly swollen and is very sensitive to the touch (on the outside).

Once again,  thank you so much for your replies. honestdoc: I think your extended pain is unusual and taking the antibiotics prophylactically maybe wise.  Be sure to finish and never skip doses.  The bump behind the recently extracted tooth down by the cheek could be excess tissue or fistula (draining abscess).  Both should clear up.

Here is the link https://imgur.com/a/BURQGUU \nWhy am i posting? Well my dentist thought that there might be something there, right side, that obvious maxilary sinus thing, first i had an xray done for C16, then he asked for the full scan. He then asked a person that is a surgeon if there might be something there, and he said that's just the way the maxilary sinus is. \nMore info:\nC16 had it's nerve removed and filled, as this is the main reason i went to the dentists, i sometimes had discomfort there, and decided to have it checked. This was in february. Last week i had a new pain, this time sharp and 10/10, i believed that it was the same tooth, but after checking with the dentist it seems that it was C14.\nMore info:\nThe pain from C14 was very sharp and it went away in ~10seconds if cold water was applied, and it went straight to 10 in 5 seconds if hot water was applied (coffee,soup etc), that's how he tested the tooth, applied hot water with a syringe at the base of the tooth.\nThat was yesterday, C14 now has a temporary filling and if the pain does not come back i get to keep the nerve. There was a small cavity that he found, had no sedation done for the work, it hurt a bit but was manageable.\nMore info: \nI have some discomfort at the right hyloid greater horn and from what i see in xray it went down a bit, no idea why.\nThank you for reading/replying! MattKW: I don't understand the tooth numbering system you're using. Can you identify in another way? FDI or UNS? thomr: https://i.pinimg.com/736x/76/3d/4c/763d4c093ecf82e8f3968b45b3e5df6f.jpg\nc16 would be Right 16\nc14 would be Right 14 MattKW: I think you mean FDI; here's your 2018 OPG renumbered. If I interpret your question correctly, the 16 has a temp filling; the 15 is root-filled (poorly); the 46 is very poorly root-filled. Hot/cold pain is likely coming from 16 as the cavity appears close to pulpal horn. If it settles, have it filled and all will go well. The hyloid horn (I think you mean hyoid) is insignificant - just caused by different positioning when the OPG was taken. Does this help you? thomr: Almost, 16 has its root removed two months ago and filled, so after the large xray was done, 15 was done in 2013 or before and the temporary is 14 because using hot water it reacted (16 did not) and it did had a small cavity mark, and when he drilled it went down a bit. I still have some pain now, not that sharp pain from hot but a pain that comes and goes, more of a nag than that 10/10, but seems to come from under 16, if i bump the teeth i feel a shock, he tested it however with some cold spray and said it was non vital, meaning the root was gone all the way.\nNow i'm afraid to fully test to hot, because last time(wednesday) it went very bad, could not stabilize and it lasted for 20 hours, meaning i had to hold cold water in my mouth (5deg from fridge) and had to exchange it every 3 to 4 minutes because when it got warmer(body temp) the pain came back. Thursday i had it checked and the temporary 14 was done but as i said there is still some pain around.\nI could ask the dentist for that xray for 16, i had i done this tuesday and the filling(root removed) is visible MattKW: thomr said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tAlmost, 16 has its root removed two months ago and filled, so after the large xray was done, 15 was done in 2013 or before and the temporary is 14 because using hot water it reacted (16 did not) and it did had a small cavity mark, and when he drilled it went down a bit.

Get me up-to-date OPG or at least a bitewing pls. thomr: Will try to get the latest bitewing from 16 but it would be just  two months over the 2018 OPG. I have an appointment tomorrow.\nA question would be, based on those two OPG's do you think that there might be something wrong there? That whole 16 area towards 15 thomr: Hey Matt! This is 16 bitewing. https://imgur.com/a/vESNpBZ \nHow does it look? \nThanks! thomr: @MattKW MattKW: thomr said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHey Matt! This is 16 bitewing. https://imgur.com/a/vESNpBZ\nHow does it look?\nThanks! OK, so 16 has had an RCT, and shouldn't be a source of hot pain, although there is a possibility of a missed 4th root (mesiobuccal-2) that might still trigger pain. 17 looks OK, 15 OK (very rarely 2 canals). If there's a nagging discomfort when tapping 16, then it may be that the RCT has not been successful. thomr: He found a cavity in 14 that he filled with temporary stuff. Since then, about 2 weeks ago, i still have that temporary, said he put some zinc calcium something there and it helps heal and leave it temporary until pain is gone and then fill. Every monday i went for a check.\nThat hot reaction went away with 14 being fixed, now just some small discomfort sometimes with even room temp or cold, hot reaction seems to have gone away.\n\nWhat long term issues can i have with 16 if it has a missed root? Knocking does not provoke pain just normal sensation but now if i try chewing something hard, 5 minutes later knocking feels a bit off. MattKW: If no pain, and you can eat with it, then it's going OK. but be aware that the RCT in 16 (and 15) are not good; the canals are underpacked and short of the apices. You may develop pain here in the long term. See how it goes. thomr: A quick update, the pain eventually stopped, so now i have no reaction to both hot or cold food, everything is normal. The temporary filling in 14 stayed there for almost a month and was filled.\nThanks! honestdoc: I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with your numbering system.  Here in the US, it is tooth #3 molar, #4 premolar (bicuspid).  It is difficult to judge the poor fill quality of the root canal treatments from the x-rays alone due to its 2D nature.  Filling the root canal short does not necessarily mean it will become a problem.  Almost all canals terminate short of the apex on one of 4 sides.  I will upload that article from my home computer.  \n\nThe best thing to have happen is there is no pain and no swelling.  I see potential food trap and open proximal contact between #3 & 4 which can cause some low grade chewing pain.  Hopefully, the teeth will settle asymptomatic and have crowns placed on them.  \n\nThe latest studies and information for upper first molar root canals have many potential pitfalls.  Obviously the MB2 canals is a pain to locate and instrument.  It can also bifurcate and have lateral canals.  The bacterial species Enterococcus Faecalis is resisting 50% bleach irrigation.  Unfortunately those molars tend to have high failure rates. honestdoc: Here is the attached article that illustrates length of root canals compared to x-rays. thomr: Hello, i am \"back\". I believe i am getting an abscess on that 16 that i did here last year. https://imgur.com/a/vESNpBZ\nI will go to the dentist this week but i'm pretty sure it's an abscess, periapical. My question is, given that i had issues with this tooth, had work on it done, and it's still an issue, should i just remove it to be safe? I'm not sure about removing it given how that maxillary sinus might evolve without it and the fact that it's not in the back aka a wisdom tooth. Can it be saved? What should i do? Change dentist maybe?\n\nOn that abscess, there's not much pain, just a small bump on the outside where the top part of the root should be, if i touch it it feels funny.\n\nadding the 2018 OPG from above for reference https://www.dentistry-forums.com/attachments/capture-jpg.1561/ MattKW: If you want to save it, then go to a specialist endodontist. Otherwise extract it. No effect on maxillary sinus; the usual risk of perforation is there, but rarely occurs.. thomr: I went to the dentist after i posted here, he said it's nothing and that was it. If i touch that area with my finger and press i get a sensation as if i'm pressing on an open nerve, not a very sharp stab but that's how i would describe it as it goes away after removing pressure. A month has passed and the same sensitivity to pressure is present. Here's how it looks. https://imgur.com/a/KAZTr37 thomr: I can feel something there sometimes even when i smile. @honestdoc @MattKW any input? Thanks! thomr: This was done this week https://postimg.cc/Yh6ysyh0"

So I avoided the dentist for about 8 years due to financial issues and bad dental anxiety.\nI finally went and of course had about 7 cavities. I was expecting worse, but still, ugh.\nSo I went in about 3 weeks-month ago to get 4 cavities filled on the right side of my mouth. The dentist I went to was pretty aggressive and it was clear him and his dental assistant did NOT get along. As soon as her finished I could tell that my bite was off, but I was so anxious and scared I could barely talk....plus he ran out in a hurry.\n\n     My filings were way too high, I couldn't even keep my teeth together. But I requested an appointment at the same place with a different dentist to correct this and get my other filings done. Unfortunately I couldn't get in till last night. In the mean time, I was dealing with severe pain if I bit down wrong....Especially in my own tooth. and sever sensitivity in all my left teeth.  I couldnt even chew on a piece of bread without a shooting pain. I was basically living on ibuprofen's to try to take the edge off. I cant even floss between my two molars because even touching the side of my tooth hurts. I understand that there is sensitivity after but this is insane. Doesn't matter if it's hot, cold, warm, air, water, my tongue.....if I touch this tooth it hurts. \n\n    So last night I went back and the dentist filed down my filings....what a relief ..right? well...kind of . So now I can bite down And I thought maybe that because my filing wasn't so high that my own tooth would ease off....I was mistaken. The one tooth is still so sore and super sensitive.....I bit into a blackberry and the seed ended up in that tooth.....sharp white pain...., I still can't bite down with it. I wasnt having any pain or issues before and now I can't even use my left teeth for chewing. So I'm using the right side (which just got filings) and are super sensitive still.

Usually, this pain that you talk about is soo intense because you are doing something called primary contact where a specific part of the antagonist's tooth contacts the new foreign surface.

    "dialogue": "grease: Two and a half weeks ago I got my wisdom teeth out. A few days after the surgery I noticed an area of exposed bone underneath the two molars that are in front of my bottom left extraction site. It’s been 2 weeks since I first noticed this area and it has grown in size. I have been seeing my dentist every other day since the operation, but he seems to think nothing is wrong. This is not a dry socket as this area of exposed bone is more forward in my mouth than where the extraction site is, although I’m being treated for a dry socket in this area as well. I have been on 2 different courses od antibiotics - a Z Pack and Amoxicillin and they have not done anything. My dentist has confirmed that this area is exposed bone, but is writing me off as melodramatic. He is not taking any action or telling me what I should do. I am in increasing pain every day, and today has been the worst pain I’ve experienced yet. Should I be concerned or see a new dentist? What should I do?

I have had 3 professional opinions which are below:\n\nOpinion 1: file down lower cuspids to make room for 2 upper implants (cuspids).\nOpinion 2: file down lower cuspids 0.25mm >  install veneers on them followed by installing the 2 upper implants.\nOpinion 3: he suggested to only install upper implants and do nothing to lower cuspids.\n\nTwo dentists plan to alter the lower cuspids. In your opinion(s), do veneers need be placed on the filed down lower cuspids?\n\nMy X-Ray is attached.\n\nThanks,\nJonathan Busybee: I'm not a dentist but I would say you don't want to interfere with lower canine teeth because once you change them you cannot reverse that change.   They are two of the most important teeth in your mouth.  I'm assuming that they are worried that the implants may be too weak to oppose high canines.    What you are having done is complicated because of the force the implanted canine teeth have to take in an normal mouth, but if you adjust the lower ones you will weaken them.  Veneers on those lower teeth are not ideal.  The lower canines take more force than the upper.  Anyone adjusting them really has to be 100% sure of what they are doing.  I have been told by a dental specialist that adjusting canines is \"the wild west\" of dentistry.  Un-chartered territory where anything can happen next.  \n\nIs there any reason you cannot have veneers or crowns on your upper cuspids?   Are you hoping to restore functionality as well as aesthetics?   Because as I said I am not a dentist but I cannot see how they could possibly make an implant that's stand alone as strong as a natural canine root.   I would personally avoid having those teeth out unless you really and truly have no other option.   You cannot put them back and nature cannot be replicated easily for these particular teeth. jonbart: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI'm not a dentist but I would say you don't want to interfere with lower canine teeth because once you change them you cannot reverse that change.

The upper cuspids (where the implants will be fitted) are baby teeth and both are ready to come out (one is  decaying).

Make sure you see someone with a great deal of experience and good outcomes.   If I was having this done I'd avoid touching the lower canines unless the implants when placed make it absolutely necessary.  I think they should make the implant crown such that it does not change the bite so that you have the aesthetics without the risk to the rest of your dental equilibrium.   \n\nI'd be really interested to see a dentist here explain how they manage to make canine implants strong enough to support the function they are intended for.    Hopefully a dentist will be along soon to give you an expert opinion. jonbart: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThat's a shame because it's a very complex area.

Do you have a photo of your teeth? I'm taking some this afternoon and will upload this evening =] MattKW: You may well have to file down the height of the lower canines (0.25mm is not significant) because the lower canines have slightly overgrown to compensate for the short baby canines. I don't see the need for veneers though. Canines are incredibly tough teeth and i don't understand how veneers will help them.\nIf they mean to shave back the lower canines inwards, then that is more tricky. It all comes down to how the proposed implant crowns will fit in with the existing teeth. Sometimes braces are required to move teeth fractionally before placing permanent implants. I would still be avoiding veneers for those lower canines."

I have been suffering significant tooth pain for the last three days, the pain ebbs and flows throughout the day and is worse after eating and causes sleepless nights. If I tap on the top of my three bottom teeth they both produce pain. \n\nI experienced this before (3 months ago) in the same area and visit my dentist who couldn’t see anything on the x-ray, 2 days later the pain was gone.\n\nToday I got an emergency dental appointment with the NHS, the young dentist was very friendly and did the cold vitality test which the results I gave him confused him as they were not consistent, I could feel cold on all three teeth(it’s really hard to be accurate). He did an X-ray and can see in abscess on the root area where two tooth roots kissed. He didn’t want to do a root canal on one just in case it was the wrong one. That sounds fair enough, he told me I should take ibuprofen and co-codamol as well as some antibiotics I already had from the previous visit which I never took(flucloxicilin). What wasn’t made clear is that will this go away again, I was under the impression antibiotics can’t ‘cure’ an abscess and a extraction or root canal was necessary. \n\nSomething to note was that he nor the previous dentist could find any cavity/cause. Although I have a darkened patch on the front of the tooth which is a genetic oddity according to my regular dentist but I did mention when I visit the hygienist when the water jet is sprayed on that patch it hurts like hell.\n\nI appreciate the fact that he didn’t want to destroy a vital tooth by mistake but should I go and see a specialist who has better diagnostic equipment?

Thank you. honestdoc: Unfortunately immediate dentures (making dentures before teeth extraction) does not fit accurately.  The denture technician removes the teeth from the model and \"guesses\" how the bone and gums will situate after extractions.  All of this should have been communicated with you at the consultation visit.  After 4 to 6 months when your bone and gums heal and stabilizes, you can have a reline or remake a more accurate fitting denture (at additional costs)."

My jaws don’t seem to line up the same anymore. Also I now am slightly sensitive to hot things and chewing on that side. \n\nBecause of my fear of dentists I have waited TWO MONTHS before going back in with these issues. I asked him to check the filling height and he said it was fine.

I really feel like this is the problem but he says no. Busybee: go to another (reputable) dentist, tell them the tooth is giving you pain, do not go into the history and ask whether there is any indication that it needs root treatment.   Ask them to check the bite.  It should not cost much to have such an examination. \n\nIf the filling is too high you should be able to feel it in your jaw muscle on one side.  The muscle will be tensing more on the higher side when you clench.   If it feels high then it usually is.\n\nWhich teeth did you have filled ?  (upper/lower, molar/premolar?) Were they both on one side and was it composite or amalgam? Hope: Thank you so much for your reply!! I have been contemplating going to have another dentist take a look so I really appreciate that suggestion. I agree that would probably be best at this point. I do have one more appointment with my doctor after I finish the antibiotics he prescribed me (he said it might resolve the issue, but I’m not really sure why he thinks that because he said there was no sign of infection on the x-ray). At this last appointment I will see if I can get him to check my bite.\n\nBoth fillings were in the upper second  premolar. One on the left side and one on the right. The right side is giving me pain while the left is only mildly sensitive to cold and sweets. They were composite fillings.\n\nToday I have been trying to check how the bite feels (clenching teeth) and now I’m having pain in the upper second premolar (where cavity was filled) and the matching tooth on the bottom. I’m also having pain that radiates into my jaw and ear region. It is not super painful but annoying.\n\nIf it is high (which I think it is) then it’s not very high. It doesn’t make my bite severely abnormal but just enough where I seem to hold my mouth different. Also, I noticed immediately after the appointment that the filling was rough and jagged and a small piece broke off the day it was done. I remember complaining to my husband that it was driving me bonkers because it felt so weird after the anesthesia wore off but over the last 2 months I’ve kind of gotten used to it. Hope: The weird thing is when he was doing the filling he told me how it was a super ROUTINE filling and would have been the perfect model for dental school. Said it was nowhere near the nerve. \n\nAnd when I went in with the tooth pain he said it was a very strange case but the symptoms sounded like they needed root canal. I’m just worried that we jumped so quickly to root canal for a tooth that is giving me some minor pain. MattKW: Maybe try some desensitising toothpaste. If they're upper 2nd premolars, then consider changing to amalgams; no-one will see them. Composites can easily have post-op sensitivity symptoms like you describe. I agree that jumping to an RCT is over the top unless simpler options have been tried. Du_deleted: Hi,\nI am exactly have the same issues now .\nIt's been 9 months after my fillings and I still have many issues with that. \nI went to a new dentist today to check that. I am having pain in my left side jaw joint near ear. New dentist didn't tell me the reason for the pain and told me to replace my fillings with root canal or crown at the upper back tooth.

Then I was told to wait 4 months for the porcelain crown to be placed. The same day I started noticing some tingle on the lips, however it was on the opposite side of the face, the dentist told me there was no nerve affected, so apparently it was not paresthesia. Something else I noticed is a metal taste coming directly from the implant. It's like having literally a 9 volt battery in the mouth all the time. Some days after the implant, I also started noticing some tremors on the fingers and some muscle contractions in arms, none of this was there before the implant surgery. Although the lips tingle is still there, it is not as strong as before, but still quite annoying, however I am also worried about the fingers. Visiting and telling the dentist about this, on the second week the dentist recommended me to be on antibiotics for another week to prevent infection. I am now probably going to see the dentist/surgeon again, and I am personally considering pulling the implant out. I feel like something is not right. Looking on the internet, but being no specialist myself, I suspect either \"oral galvanism\" or some kind of autoimmune response to the metals of the implant. Do you think this is possible? I have read that no implant in the world is 100% titanium, and that they always contain other metals. Depending on the metal, our system can reject it or show some allergy to the implant. Have you had any similar case or do you have any similar experience like this? I already have another titanium dental implant for many years without any issues, but after investigating a bit, I realized its from another brand. Apparently the other implant is better quality than this one."

    "title": "Question about charges for bridge work",
    "dialogue": "LR77: Long story short, I had a previously injured tooth (from childhood) that was ankylosed.  Had a veneer on it 20-some years ago and it was fine all that time.  6 months ago I found out that there was root resorption, tooth came out and was hopeful for an implant but no luck.  Not enough bone even after the graft.  SO that brings me to the bridge question.  I've gone for an eval and estimate which was much higher than I expected.  For each of the 2 abutments they're coding for \"core buildup, including any pins\" - is this necessary as a separate procedure?  From what I understand this is for significant tooth decay or such that it needs to be restored prior to receiving the bridge.  My abutment teeth are in good health.\n\nThey're also charging for \"unspecified fixed prosthetic procedure\" for all 3 units.... $187 x 3!!  This is not covered by my insurance and they did not really explain what it was for, only that it's part of the procedure.  My insurance company said the covered charge for the crown/pontic/crown units IS the procedure so I'm really confused as to why the additional fees are listed.\n\nLastly, they are charging for laser treatment for all 3 units which I understood as being something to do with preparing the site so I guess I get that and will have to swallow the $120 x 3 for that part but again was just taken back by the total of $3300.\n\nOH - and they're suggesting a \"deep cleaning\" because I have a permanent retainer on the bottom arch.  I've never been told there's an extra charge for cleaning around that.  Never.  \n\nIf anyone can advise as to whether I'm being ripped off.... I'd appreciate it!   This is a front tooth so kind of important cosmetically but I'm a poor teacher with apparently crappy insurance! Busybee: I am sorry you lost your tooth from resorption.  Get a second opinion about the bridge.   It's a big step so it's worth paying extra for only if you have a good dentist to look after you from start to finish. honestdoc: I believe all the extra charges you mentioned are a scam.  Deep cleaning is for gum disease with attachment loss probing depths at 5 mm or deeper.  How did you find this dentist?  Ask people who they like and check him or her out.  If you are unsure about charges and fees, chances are the dentist is hungry. LR77: This practice has great reviews... and I liked the dentist!  Until I got the estimate.  I'm thinking people just blindly think whatever they're told is honest and true and pay what's asked.  I'm getting another opinion next week.  I just wanted to know that I'm not crazy! MattKW: Scammer. If your supporting teeth are in good condition then there is no need for cores or pins.\nLaser treatment for the gums perhaps? Doubtful.\n\"Unspecified\"? ask them to specify and justify. Would you take that from a car mechanic without questioning?\nAll that said, $3300 is a good price; I'd be charging over $4000 for high-precious PFM bridge."

I am going to switch back to a different toothpaste but will it revert back to how they were? They were quiet nice teeth before,shiny,not blinding white or yellow (just how theyre supposed to be), im really scared that my teeth wont go back to how they were because of the damage fluoride may/can cause to the teeth,hopefully they will be fine since i havent used it for too long.\n\nWhat are your toughts on this? Will they go back to how they were or not?\n\nThank you,any help i will be internally grateful for. Busybee: I've never ever heard that you can stain your teeth with fluoride paste.  I can't see how fluoride could permeate enamel.     I have read that having fluoride in drinking water can lead to stained teeth in some children if they have too much fluoride during dental development.   \n\nI think what can happen is that some pastes have more abrasives than others.  If you go back to using a more gentle formulation that suits you then you should find that your teeth recover.   It could just be that you have brushed some imperceptable staining off and when you stop using it the teeth will go back to normal.  It's what happens after dental bleaching.  Perhaps you tried a whitening colgate formula?   I always avoid any paste which mentions whitening."

    "dialogue": "Alina D: Hi everyone,\n\nI've had a porcelain fused to zirconia crown fitted a few months ago, but I think it looks too big and that the colour is completely off compared to the rest of my teeth. \n\nI've had one premolar removed in that area because I required braces since I had crowded teeth. So, this molar is very visible when I talk and laugh and I would like it to blend in with the rest of my teeth, which is sadly not the case now. \n\nI was wondering which crown to choose considering that I would need something both resistant and translucent. If you have any other recommendations besides of the ones I suggested in the title, please let me know. Thank you in advance. Busybee: It's down to the skill of the technician.  Your crown only looks different because they did not get the colour and shape right.  But the choice of material is good for that tooth.   It's really disappointing when dentists do not see the importance of the appearance of a molar crown in the smile line.  Some think that only six or eight teeth are important.  \n\nYou may hate the appearance now but there is the risk of bigger problems if you change it.  How long since you had it done? Alina D: Hi Busybee,\n\nThank you very much for your reply and for the suggestion. I will choose then another crown of this kind, but with a different colour and shape. I've had it placed 6 months ago and there is plenty of tooth structure behind it, so I hope that replacing it with a new one won't create problems. Thank you again and I wish you a good day. Busybee: Alina it's a risk to change it even if there is plenty of tooth structure.  Make sure you ask the dentist not to remove more natural tooth.   Try to get your original models so that they can match it to the natural tooth.  A good technician will match the appearance to the same tooth on the opposite side.   I understand that zirconia is not easy to work with aesthetically but a good technician can make anything look great. Alina D: I understand better now and I will follow your suggestions. I remember last time she said the only way of getting the crown to look smaller is by removing a bit of the tooth structure. Now that I know more, I will insist on not doing that. And since it's going to be the second time, I hope they will take it very seriously and that it will turn out well. Thank you again. Busybee: She may be right Alina.    It's a compromise of dental health vs aesthetics.   Ask about whether having a purely zirconia crown is possible.  It's challenging to make zirconia only crowns look as good and you may need a specialist prosthodontist and a really good technician.   If you have it redone you want to get it perfect the second time.  So make sure you have a wax up to show you how the tooth will look.  Make sure you see the technician for a colour match.   Take your time to get it just right before you take this crown off.   Don't let the dentist rush you."

I have a small jaw so growing up my adult teeth couldn’t come in properly. I have many crooked teeth. Some have been forcefully pushed onwards facing my tongue. I try very hard to keep up good dental hygiene but it seems I just have bad genes. I’ve had 4 teeth removed. Mostly I. The back, I had wisdom teeth coming out which forced so hard that cracked the teeth in front of them which resulted in abscesses and then removals. I have had two root canals done in the last 4 years. Both teeth are within the first 4 top front ones. The infections were so painful. One tooth that had the root canal broke off in October of 2018. Now since Friday passed a piece had broken off the other tooth I had a root canal on and it got infected again!!! Now on antibiotics and pain meds. I’m just so darn fed up with my teeth. I’m so sick of paying all these hefty prices only to turn around shortly after and spend almost triple the amount to fix them. I paid 850$ for my first root canal. 450 for my second. Around 120$ for each filling, and removal I’ve ever received. I’m only 28 years old! The dentist tells me to get this one tooth fixed (the one that broke off) will cost me around 2000+ to get fixed. That is more than my monthly income . They don’t offer any payment plans or financing so I am expected to pay full price right away. And with what I have going on right now besides that broken tooth I’m looking at a lot more than that. I just don’t know what to do. \n\nI live in a small rural town in Quebec Canada and the dental services around here are limited. They can only do so much. They used to offer payment plans but some bad apples ruined it for those of us who did pay. \n\nI’m just wondering if anyone has any advice on what I can do to get my teeth fixed if possible all one shot?

This is unlike a medical immunisation where they aim for safer areas. \nYou will also often get haematomas that are deeper and you can't see, such as for block injections of lower teeth.

At the time, x-rays looked good and it appeared as if the bone had fully integrated with the implant. The implant looked good in November 2018 when I went in for my 6 month cleaning.\n\nA week ago, I noticed the crown would move slightly inward if I touched it manually, but when I pushed down on it, it would be more firm and not move. Sometimes I could hear a mechanical clicking noise when it moved after being pushed down. I called my dentist and I am seeing him tomorrow. I have no pain, redness, swelling, gum recession or anything like that. Physically, it looks like nothing is wrong. \n\nI think the crown was cemented onto the abatement, but I have no idea if there is a hole in the tooth to access the screw.

The pain used to be already present when biting down without food, but I explained my complaint to the dentist. He said it was probably due to my bite (my back upper molars are crooked). He edged off a tiny bit of my tooth, and the pain when biting down was immediately gone. He took a bite-wing X-ray (of which I don't have a picture). However, the pain is still present sometimes when I eat something tough. I didn't go to the dentist a second time with this problem yet.\n\nIt is probably not unimportant to say that I have a small filling in that molar. My dentist closely examined everything and didn't mention anything. I asked specifically if it could be the wisdom tooth pushing against it but he said it was deep still and was unlikely to cause problems at this point.\n\nI would like to note that I don't care about the pain. While it can be strong at times, I have to deliberately bite down with that spot to trigger it. Better said: if it stays like this, no problem. I just don't want it to be a ticking time bomb.\n\nThe attached pictures are the molar I'm talking about and a very recent x-ray.

I got one removed today actually, other one in a few months.\nShould I mention the crack idea to my dentist? I actually had it checked out again today by a different dentist, who also said the pain was most likely from a crooked molar possibly in combination with pressure from the wisdom tooth. I find it a but strange none of them mentioned the idea of crack, they’re both good dentists. MattKW: Raise it if they haven't mentioned it already. The fact that pain was relieved a bit when your tooth was shortened says that at least it's related to that tooth, and that it's related to the biting pressures on that tooth.

After looking at x -ray(see the images attached) doctor said it didn't went to the bottom so we do a permanent filling and then if it is not working then we go for nerve filling. So after the permanent filling whenever i do mouth washing i feel some weirdness in that teeth(like water go inside the teeth) and whenever i touch the teeth i got a little pain (not a big btw). anyway i waited for nearly for ten months and went to see dentist. Dentist told me that there is a broken place in that teeth that is why i got that weired feeling. So he again did permanent filling to that broken place(said old filling is good and will do nerve filling when necessary). From that day i don't get that weird feeling when there is water in my mouth. But i got little weirdness after i wake up(may be due to saliva) now. Plus weird feeling(little pain i think) comes and goes time to time from that teeth and when i touch the teeth same little pain comes.\nPlease let me know what to do. Can I save this teeth?

After fillings, the teeth may feel strange.  If your tooth feels cold, it is normal, the nerve is working.  If your tooth feels intense pain that can wake you at night, your tooth nerve is damaged.  If you have swelling next to your teeth, the tooth nerve has died and became infected. Gayan: Very much thanks for replying. I highly appreciate it. I am from sri lanka. I went to to see another dentist and i was told that i get this feelings because the filling is a metal one and the filling is deep one near to blood vessels. I was asked to take x ray (which is here https://ibb.co/hR5Ntr6 and you can get which teeth got the filling by here https://ibb.co/dpSSD9T ) and informed me that no need to go for nerve filling (told me that after nerve filling teeth will break after 10-15 years). But dentist cleared the gap between two teeth( gap between the teeth with filling and other teeth). So I get the feeling from this teeth for whole time(well most of the time). Can't say it is a pain. How can i get away from this feeling? Is there anything I can do rather than waiting for nerve filling? And no i don't have intense pain in that teeth and no swelling next to that teeth. Thanks in advance! honestdoc: Unfortunately your cavities are pretty big and you may have sensitivity after the filling.  Hopefully the sensitivity will lessen over time.  The only way to rid of the sensitivity is to do a root canal or pull the tooth. Gayan: Ok. Thank you so much for the info doctor."

It's like nerve pain mixed with an ache spreading through most of the teeth on that one side and even into my sinuses/eye/neck/jaw... I went to the dentist and got an x-ray of the tooth and he said the filling is NOt near the nerve but there is a dark shadow under the filling which could be an air space ... But I don't understand how this could be causing me all this pain... he recommmended replacing the filling before considering root canal...? Please give advice, im worried, thanks! honestdoc: Please provide x-ray image(s).  Most likely the dentist placed a tooth colored filling called composites.  Modern composites shrink about 1 percent during light curing.  This shrinkage can create sensitivity, micro gaps,  and bonded teeth micro fractures.  On x-rays, there may be a dark line under the filling.  We don't know if it is a gap, a cavity, or extra bond that pooled underneath.  \n\nMost dentist will disagree with me but I like the latest glass ionomer filling.  It bonds naturally with no shrinkage and naturally desensitizes the nerve.  Traditional Glass Ionomers do not have good wear strength but the latest Fuji Equia had shown similar wear strengths as flowable composites.  An even better product is called Activa Bioactive restorative composites which is stronger and mimics natural teeth.  Most dental clinics don't use this product because of its high costs.  Many dentists in the US don't use amalgam \"silver fillings\" anymore.  Amalgams have a longevity track record.  I find them to be stronger than surrounding tooth structure and in larger fillings (less tooth remaining), the teeth tends to chip or fracture.  I hope the bioactive restorative materials will be more available in the future. Ferny1414: It is a composite filling, i dont have the xrays but i remember seeing a very distinct horizontal shadow directly below the filling.\nIf it is a gap or something? Is that known to cause pain? honestdoc: Pain may result from factors such as recent drilling, proximity of filling to nerve (pulp), possible gap or marginal seal deterioration, bite may be off, or isolated/routine grinding and clenching .  Again, it is hard to determine if the black line is a gap or pooling of extra bond.  I don't think it is a cavity since it was recently restored.  I'm very conservative...less drilling the better.  When fillings get replaced, there are more drilling on teeth involved.  The best scenario would be to assess the filling and maybe not replace it if appropriate.  The sensitivity most likely cold can lessen with time.  I tell my patients that if the tooth feels cold, then the nerve of the teeth is working properly.  Just don't overwhelm it with too much cold which can damage the nerve.  If the pain gets too intense such as waking you at night, then the nerve is damaged and the tooth will need a root canal."

MattKW: I can't tell much from a photo one day post-op. If you get a dry socket it will usually occur ~3-4 days post-op. You will get severe, unrelenting pain, a bad taste, and a foul breath. So, wait and see - nothing else you can do to influence the outcome now. As long as you can handle the post-op pain well with normal painkillers, then you don't have a dry socket.

    "dialogue": "hammondjulia: I have had pain on my lower teeth on my left side for the past month. Specifically it's teeth numbers 20 and 21. It's a dull pain and I wake up and worry about it every day. I have seen TWO dentists who have both said nothing is wrong and have performed every test imaginable to see if they can find anything wrong with them. They even did an official check-up to see if it was referred pain, but nothing. Sometimes the pain will shift to my molars, and other times to my bottom anteriors. They thought maybe it was grinding or clenching, and they grinded them down, but they still hurt. I am on Clinpro 5000 toothpaste as well as MI paste, and I feel like I am going insane. I have seen an endodontist, and nothing. They are sensitive to hot, cold, and sweet foods. I do have depression and anxiety, and I have been messing with them all month long. I keep pushing them with my tongue and tapping on them, to test their sensitivity. It's hard to sleep without thinking about them, and I keep convincing myself that I'll have this pain for forever. \n\nHow can I stop thinking about my teeth? If three dentists have told me there is nothing wrong, how can I convince myself to stop messing with them? Is there any reason why they could still be hurting? honestdoc: I agree with the previous dentists that you may be grinding and or clenching your teeth unknowingly.  According to experts, your teeth touch only 20 minutes a day including all meals and function.  Grinding and clenching could easily exceed 20 minutes of teeth contact per day and can cause pain & damage to you jaws, TMJ, and teeth.  I recommend a custom night guard that is hard on the outside and soft on the inside to accommodate you teeth.  I even recommend you use it during the day in addition to night use if you don't have to communicate like in meetings, etc.  I had a similar problem and it took about 5 years for my pain to subside.  I believe you may have unresolved stress in addition to anxiety.  Hopefully you can manage it or get professional help because it can destroy you.\n\nSweet sensitivity may mean you have exposed dentin or roots.  In addition to grinding which may cause cervical abfraction damage, you may be brushing too hard and traumatizing your gums causing gum recession.  Your dentists would have detected gum recession.  The Clinpro 5000 as well as MI paste could help with sweet & cold sensitivy by helping the exposed areas remineralize. This won't happen overnight and will take about 2 months of constant use. MattKW: If your pain is there almost continually, a faint possibility is ask for a long-lasting block LA (bupivacaine or ropivacaine) to see if that stops the pain. If it does, then I'd go for the same LA around the premolars, and finally the anteriors to move towards the front. It's a rough method and not always accurate, but it might narrow it down. In the past 2 years I've had 2 patients with imperceptible cracks in perfectly good teeth (a 15 and a 30) that were hard to narrow down.\nIf the LA doesn't work at all, then it might be time for a neurologist, and possibly a psychiatrist for the anxiety that might be contributing to your pain perception."

    "title": "Rationale behind brushing in morning",
    "dialogue": "Slobo: Dear all,\n\nThere are many sources that claim that we should wait at least 30 minutes to brush after having a meal. The reason being that pH increases while we eat (and demineralization of enamel occurs), which makes our teeth \"less hard\", and it takes some time for the pH to stabilize.\n\nOn the other hand, many sources suggest that we should brush in morning. But also many sources state that our saliva is the most acidic in mornings. Moreover, I have performed some tests with pH strips on myself, and in fact my saliva is usually more acidic in morning that right after having a meal. It drops below 7.0 almost only in mornings.\n\nSo, why brushing in morning doesn't damage teeth given that saliva is acidic then? Also, do you know how low acidity of saliva of a healthy person drops during the night?\n\nThank you.\n\nBest, Busybee: I have no idea how acidic my saliva is on waking, but I always brush straight after getting up in the morning rather than after breakfast. Slobo: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI have no idea how acidic my saliva is on waking, but I always brush straight after getting up in the morning rather than after breakfast. Thanks. I do exactly the same, and in addition I avoid brushing teeth for at least 40ish minutes after a meal (e.g., a dinner). But still, it would be good to know what is the difference (if any) of acidity caused by processes in mouth during night, and the processes occurring during/after meals. Busybee: My reasoning is that if you remove any overnight plaque before eating then there is little there for a plaque acid attack from breakfast.   I would still floss after eating, but you don't have to wait to do that.   Also you get the max protection from fluoride etc. MattKW: Saliva maintains a close balance of between 6.8 and 7.0 over a daily cycle in the absence of eating food. I've never heard of it changing more severely than this because the body works hard to maintain homeostasis.If you cleaned your teeth before bedtime, then there should be very little plaque growth overnight (no snacking!). So, the next intake of food at breakfast will result in plaque growth, metabolism, and hence pH drop. But if it's a normal meal and not acidic e.g. citrus fruits, then there is no need to wait 30mins before brushing Your oral pH has to drop to about 5.5 before you get softening of teeth. This is more associated with acidic foods and drinks like soft drinks, sports drinks, etc than everyday food. So, you brush the plaque off your teeth AFTER breakfast. there is no advantage doing it before breakfast. Busybee: It works fine for me MattKW.  I do drink fresh squeezed orange juice at breakfast. MattKW: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIt works fine for me MattKW.  I do drink fresh squeezed orange juice at breakfast. Then you should rinse out with water and wait 30mins before brushing, giving time for the saliva to reminineralise your teeth. Slobo: Thanks for your replies, and also thank you very much for the article. If you have more on this subject, I would appreciate if you share. I search for them when I have some question, but usually it is hard to find a right one.\n\n\n\nMattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSaliva maintains a close balance of between 6.8 and 7.0 over a daily cycle in the absence of eating food.

Oh, I never got exactly what happens when the teeth are softened. Does it mean that at 5.5 layers of teeth start dissolving and ‚‚disappearing'', or only means that it is easier to damage the surface by hard objects (e.g., tooth brush)? MattKW: It is softened, therefore if you leave it alone for 30mins, the salivary minerals will allow rehardening. It's all a matter of moderation. If you just have the occasional acidic drink, like BusyBee's OJ in the morning, then you'll probably get insignificant erosion. Some people, esp tradespeople who might have a vending machine and do hot, thirsty work are the one who drink a lot and get severe erosion.

Some people, esp tradespeople who might have a vending machine and do hot, thirsty work are the one who drink a lot and get severe erosion. Oh, I don't drink those drinks. The only acidic drink I have is coffee, almost exclusively in afternoons. Do you think I should report to a doctor that my UWS is at low 6 in mornings?\n\nBy the way, the reason why I asked whether lower pH dissolves layers of enamel or not is that many sources on the web say that stomach acid \"wears away\" tooth enamel. So, not sure how to understand that. MattKW: I would be very wary of pH tests that you can buy from shops or online; there can be wide variation in accuracy.\nStomach acid becomes a problem if you have reflux, or bulimia and are then bringing up stomach acid. It develops a particular pattern of erosion on teeth that is easily diagnosed. Busybee: i'm wondering how fast saliva neutralises acidic food.   If saliva has a normal healthy PH surely it gives excellent protection pretty fast?

I see now that information, for instance, at https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/e/tooth-erosion-and-acid-reflux. Out of curiosity, why the inside surface of teeth suffer more than the outside surface? Indeed, they are more exposed to products coming from stomach, but also more exposed to saliva which neutralizes acid. Slobo: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\ti'm wondering how fast saliva neutralises acidic food.   If saliva has a normal healthy PH surely it gives excellent protection pretty fast? From what I understood from many sources on the web, in a healthy person it takes around 30 minutes to stabilize pH level and having re-mineralization do its job. As I recall, some sources, but very few, mention the time of one hour. 30 minutes seems to be the rule of thumb."

    "dialogue": "Angelique29: Anybody have an opinion on what to do next? Here's my story:\nI've had on and off random \"stinging\" in the upper right quadrant. My PCD thought it may be CTS but nothing ever tested positive to any cold/hot/percussion testing etc. PA's looked fine. We added this symptom to a watch list and checked on it every routine check up but we could never duplicate the stinging I was experiencing. \n\nMoving forward 5 years, I move to a different city and changed PCD's. Since i moved I noticed an increase in the sensitivity but can't actually duplicate it. Express concerns but there were suspicions by the dds that this was related to my allergy issues because they as well cant create the pain and nothing shows on pa's. They thought maybe since my allergies are so bad and my sinus cavity almost looks like it overlaps with my roots that it creates this sensation when my allergies flare up?  I admit they were pretty bad and I'm in treatment for it.\n\nThis November comes around and I started feeling pain that flucuated between my ear, jaw and upper and lower quadrant but never consistent. I went to urgent care and i was advised that I have an ear infection although my ear canals looked fine and he prescibed sudafed.\n\nThe following day, my face was swollen, and assumed it was an abscess and I wasnt comfortable with the ear infection with fine canals theory... I also found a little lump that was in the pocket of where my cheek and the top of my gums would connect (lack the term for this). I sought a second opinion with a dds that was on call due to the holiday who stated no abscess or any concerns with neighboring teeth. He also noted that I have very long roots and my sinus cavity is very low. He Suggested I go to ENT maybe but didn't look like dentistry. \n\nOver the course of that weekend  my face swell so bad that I could see my cheek from my eye lol and had to eat/drink from a straw. I went to go check with my medical doctor because at this point I'm maxing out ibuprofen and tylenol and nobody was willing to give me antibiotics and the pain levels ed l was at as max.  Doctor said I had a blocked salivary gland. He asked another doc in the office to come in and look - he also agreed. I was prescribed \"finally\" antibiotics and the infection went away after a few days. However, during the wait time for my ENT appointment the lump felt like it grew. Later I was put on a second round of antibiotics as the growth started to get bigger and pain was returning as I waited for my appointment with the ent. \n\nFinally got to the ENT who stated it couldn't be a blocked salivary gland because of the location. He also noted that it could be a sinus fracture and requested a CT scan to rule out all of the above. CT though came back fine. \n\nIn the mean time, this little itty bitty lump started mostly in the pocket of my cheek and has grown  to where it \"feels\"like two inches. It's becoming difficult to brush without touching it. I've consulted different professionals in different fields and nobody has a clue what it is or what to do. I'm paying for xray, visits, prescriptions etc. And I'm not getting anywhere.\n\nThoughts on what to do next? honestdoc: Could you provide an image?  I'm guessing the inflammed, irritated, or blocked Stenson's duct which opens into the mouth from the parotid gland.  The ENT should be aware of that.  A salivary stone should be evident in the x-ray/CT scans along with any tumors, cysts, pathology.  If is is not the teeth, it may be beyond a dentist's scope.  You may consider a referral to Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeon for evaluation."

I have impacted lower second molars that grow sideways on both left and right side.  The second molar is pushing the tooth in the front (I believe that's the first molar).  I had bad cavities on both of the impacted lower second molars and first molars because food easily got trapped.  I remember my dentist mentioned that the cavities were deep near the nerves.  My dentist managed to fill the cavities around 3-4 years ago.  However, when I eat / drink cold, the tooth reacts to cold and it gave me like a throbbing sensation on the lower second molars area.\n\n\n\nMy left hand side is even more complicated.  The situation is worse because I lost my lower second premolar 12 years ago and I haven't done any bridge to fill the gap.  The upper second premolar starts drifting down which I believe is called super eruption.\n\n\nI did some researches online, many articles suggested to upright the second molar at young age.  I wish I would have gotten a chance to do brace when I was still a teenager.  At my age of 30, Is it too late to do the brace? \n\n\nI am also planning to have a baby in this year or two.  I am not sure if doing the brace works well with pregnancy plan.\n\n\nInstead of upright the second molar, the study mentioned to extract the second molar as a least effective approach.  If I choose to extract the lower second molar(s), I wonder if the wisdom tooth is going to come out?  Any other alternatives besides these two?\n\n\nI would like to get the problems as soon as possible but right now I am so dreaded at the same time.  Any advice is truly appreciated.\n\nAttached is the X-ray of my lower left (impacted second molar, first molar, and missing second premolar) - image was taken last month. MattKW: 1st molar is hopeless; extract it.\n2nd molars might be able to be uprighted, but should initially take out 3rd molars before trying. The 2nd molars can only easily be uprighted by tipping backwards. Moving them forward as well would be difficult and probably not worth trying. You would fill the gap with either a denture, or implants, or possibly a bridge.\n\nAs an alternative, if you extracted the 1st and 2nd molars, hoping for the 3rd molars to come through - this will NOT work satisfactorily."

    "dialogue": "Bungle73: Hi.\n\nI've got a tooth that I've had trouble with for quite a long time. Just over twenty years ago I had a filling replaced and a root canal done on it. Subsequently I've have had to have the filling replaced a few times as it fell out. The last time left hardly any support for the new filling, after the drilling, and that eventually fell out too. I left it quite a while (years) before seeing another dentist, and when I did see one he told me that there was some decay because I had left it so long, and it may need to be extracted. Seeing my reaction to this he said that he could try and save it by drilling out the decay putting a crown on it, which he did. This was in September/October 2017. The tooth was fine after this, until about a year later around the end of August last year. At this time I had some hot food burn my gum in the same area of my mouth. Ever since then I have had  a re-occurring puss filled spot just above the crowned tooth, which I believe is an abscess. What I'm concerned about is this due to the burn, or was that coincidence that it occurred at the same time, and there is something wrong with the tooth? Also, what I'm really worried about is exactly what the treatment the dentist is likely to do, as I've been reading worrying things on the internet about it. I have no pain, but as I say, the tooth has had a root canal.  Am I worrying about nothing? Bungle73: I've been trying to treat it first with TCP, and then with Corsodyl gel but I'm not sure it's doing anything. Bungle73: This is what looks like atm. MattKW: It's an abscess, unrelated to the hot food. \nIf root canal therapies get reinfected from not being sealed with a good filling or if decay gets in there again, then it can take months for the bacteria to work down the inside of the canal to set off an abscess. Maybe this is what has happened to you. Considering that the last dentist wasn't keen on saving it, I regret to tell you I think your chances of successful retreatment are now even less. Go to a dentist.

I've already put off one appointment that I had scheduled for a checkup, because I was apprehensive about what he would do about it......... MattKW: Well, he can't force you to do anything about it if you don't want to. But better to find out the situation now and plan for it rather than have unexpected emergency that makes you suffer at an inconvenient time. And don't do what so many people do by simply taking antibiotics; at best it might suppress the abscess for a while, but it'll never fix it.

It has been a while since I have been to a dentist (three years) but am making an appointment.

Go to your dentist and see what he says. They are usually very easy extractions."

I was then put on antibiotics and when I went back she said the tooth needed to be removed and it couldn't be saved. I then went to another dentist who said the tooth was fine and he couldn't see anything wrong with the tooth itself and that it could be because my filling is deep into the tooth and also because of the trauma. If worse comes to worse he will do a root canal. He was more bothered about fillings I apparently needed on other teeth. I just want this sorted. Also both x-rays looked very different. Would a 3rd opinion be a safe option?\n\nThank you MattKW: Well, here's your 3rd opinion here if you can get up copies of the Xrays.

My dentist said everything looked really good after the root canal and prescribed clindamycin. My final dose will be this coming Tuesday morning.

Of course I’m going to call my dentist first thing in the morning and ask to be seen ASAP, but I’m starting to get worried that I have a failed root canal and am anxious for what will happen next. MattKW: Were you getting a bad taste before the RCT? Did you have a gumboil (abscess) draining into your mouth?\nNormally it is not necessary to prescribe antibiotics after an RCT; one of the rare side effects of clindamycin can be a change in taste perception.

I am now 24. knew from a prior dentist that filled a back molar i would need more as my grooves are deep. i visited a dentist for a checkup, got some x-rays and the next day had two fillings.\n\n\nI can't afford to get all the work done being a poor intern and I'm due to go back next week to get another filling and she wants to redo the x-rays. However, the fillings do not match at all. The back molar was the one filled by a prior dentist and as you can see it matches perfectly. whereas the fillings this new one added on the sides of my teeth look absurd. Am i right in thinking this and should cancel my next appointment to stop this happening again? and can anything be done about the mismatched fillings? MattKW: Well, they are only going to look absurd to other people if you go around holding your mouth open like that! Looking at the colour density, I think they may not be composites, but glass ionomer cements (GIC) or resin-modified GIC. They are actually a good choice because they contain fluoride and release it into the surrounding tooth, unlike composite which does not have those properties.\nAnother thing to consider is that for places where the appearances aren't critical (like back teeth), I generally put in a slightly whiter filling than the real tooth because it makes it easier to check in the future. Also makes it easier to replace if required because the dentist doesn't have to do it by feel. I would even consider amalgams there for the same reasons.\nIf you really want matched fillings everywhere, ask for it next time. But there's nothing wrong from a technical viewpoint for those ones.\nAs an aside, when my old molars eventually crack again, I'll be having gold crowns because they're the best material. I want something that's going to last for a bloody long time."

I went to my regular NHS dentist and he said why not get it done out there as it is cheap and of good quality. So I had root canal work done there and then caught a bad cold so I could not be worked on further (manufacture and fitting of crowns). My work project was finished and I returned to the UK before further work could be done on my teeth. Just before I booked to go back to my regular dentist a crown on the other side came loose.\n\nHe took a look and said you need more root canal work and you need fibre pins, I can only do steel pins under the NHS, some of this work will need to be done elsewhere privately, all this is going to cost you £600 per tooth, you need 3, that’s £1800. Surprised I said I’d think about it.\n\nChecked out the NHS website, no mention of these conditions:\n\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/dentists/understanding-nhs-dental-charges/\n\nNothing about these items that are supposedly outside of the NHS, it even says ‘bridges including any pin or post aids to retention’. No mention of cover for steel but not fibre.\n\nIt seems to say that all the treatment I require, i.e. root canals, crowns, and pins are covered under the NHS (Band 3 £256.50). It feels as if he is making it up as he goes along.\n\nSo I thought to give up with this character and see if another NHS dentist would take me on.\n\nFound one up the road, rang them, yes we have vacancies. ‘Why do you want to see us?’ Loose crowns, missing bridge. ‘Oh, well we’d need to do those privately, we can’t treat existing conditions under the NHS, and only after that is done could you enrol under the NHS’.\n\nNo mention of this on the government website.

If you are having problems with a particular dentist then contact NHS England or your local CCG. oldspa: Many thanks Busybee, that's the sort of answer I was looking for!! oldspa: Contacted NHS England and queried my dentist further. Apparently because 2 of my root canals are re works of old root canal treatments I have to be referred to an endodontist. Apparently this is not covered by the NHS and this has been confirmed by NHS England. However NHS England said I could ask my dentist to submit an individual funding request to cover this, which may or may not be successful.

Never had issues with fillings before) honestdoc: You may consider getting a x-ray of the area to check for gaps in between the teeth and make sure the filling is intact.  \"Funky taste\" should be discussed because that is not a good sign.  Hopefully you are not getting food stuck or trapped.  If so, that needs to be corrected. Busybee: I don't think dentists should be routinely using composite on back tooth fillings.   The whole war against amalgam is misguided and leads to more problems in the long term.   Some dentists are simply not good as good as others at working with the material and that's not the dentist's fault.  It's horrible stuff.   I've come back from the dentist on more than one occasion having to create a gap between teeth when composite has got stuck in between teeth.  I also had major issues when a dentist decided to build up my bite using composite.   Just led to sensitivity, pain, and a worse bite.   \n\nI hope you get your issue resolved TDior."

I thought I got it under control when I got my professional night guard that my dentist charged me $700 for but that only helped at night. Last Friday I was going through some stress and I clenched my teeth and heard a crack and out came the bottom half inch of one of my bridged teeth. Will I need a whole new bridge or can this be capped in any way? I still have the part that cracked off and even when I tried gluing it back on it didn't look right so I left it off. My issue is I have gone through about 4 bridges in just the last 15 months as they either become unglued or teeth break away. This last set with the chrome backing I received in May of this year. I thought that they were indestructible. I always took great care of them but like I mentioned before, I have a terrible time controlling my daytime clenching. I was told years ago that I also have TMJ so I dont know if that has anything to do with it. Not only do I worry about fixing this broken tooth, I also worry about the future.Should I be fitted for dentures instead of this bridge or is the dentist giving me inferior bridges? Any advice would greatly be appreciated as I am almost afraid to put any food in my mouth at this point.\nThank You\nJM honestdoc: My opinion will differ with many dentists.  I am very conservative and I don't like most bridges (drilling on teeth to put false teeth in).  I think bridges can be very barbaric because of the amount of drilling it takes.\n\nNow how badly is the bridge damaged/ failed?  The best case scenario is to conservatively remove the bridge and repair porcelain.  That removal of the bridge and repairing porcelain may not be predictable.  There is a product called Metalift crown removing system that may be able to remove the bridge.  I've never used it.  Talk to your dentist about the options and try to achieve minimal drilling if possible.  Another option is to leave the fracture porcelain or smooth the area.  Bonding with resin is not durable.\n\nAnother scenario if you had root canals under bridges is possible root fracture.  That would be a nightmare especially on long span bridges.  \n\nClenching and grinding can be very destructive no matter how well you take care of your teeth.  You may have to use your night guard during the day if you find yourself doing that.  If you have TMJ pain, you may need to see TMJ specialist. jamccor: I have actually started doing just that...wearing my night guard during the day under certain circumstances like driving. If I can avoid having to take out the bridge I would do it because it's been hell keeping it in. It would fall out every month. I asked the dentist if he could glue it in permanently and he did in July and so far, except for the fracture, it hasnt come out. He did mention to me that my next step may be to start saving my money for implants. I took this to mean that if a further failure occurs, that may be my only option. He know  i can't afford implants as I am still paying off the bridge. I wonder if I should get a second opinion by another dentist? I am really trying to baby this bridge as it is an investment but sooner or later I need to get the fracture fixed whatever it costs. honestdoc: If the fractured part of a bridge can just be smoothed, that may be the best scenario. jamccor: The bottom half inch of one of my bonded teeth has broken off. What is the process of smoothing? honestdoc: Smoothing involves the dentist running a drill on the broken surface and later polish it with rubber burs.  The broken porcelain cannot be bonded back on (the bridge needs to be off for it to be bonded in an oven).  The bridge would stay in the mouth the whole time.  If the broken area is in an esthetic zone, you may have to take the bridge out which may not be easy without destroying it."

No sensitivity whatsoever. The weird thing about these episodes is that they are episodic: I will get 2-4 month spells of this pain (dull, aching, worse at night), which will eventually subside and I may then be free of pain for as much as two years. Over the past 6 years, I have been getting these 2-4 month episodes of pain at worst every 6 months, and at best once every 2 years.\n\nMy past dental history is that I have had x2 fillings of my first left lower molar (composite in 2010, amalgam in 2016) and a wisdom tooth extraction on the left lower side in 2015. I also have an overbite with some frontal crowding of the lower teeth.\n\nIn 2015 the pain was attributed to an impacted left lower wisdom tooth which was extracted. However since then I have still been having these recurrent episodes of pain unchanged from before. On 3 occasions since 2015 (post wisdom tooth extraction) I have been to my dentist regarding similar toothache: no signs of infection, annual x-rays show no damage to the teeth, filling of the first molar healthy, with no nerve involvement. The usual outcome is that I have a course of oral antibiotics which doesn’t resolve the problem, however the pain will usually subside independently of this at a later date.\n\nI attended my dentist again last week who took another x-ray of my left lower teeth, and has told me (for the first time) that the filling is slightly deep, and there is features of inflammation of the underlying ligament underneath the first molar. Again I have been advised to ride this out with a course of oral antibiotics, however this time I was told that the next option would be root canal treatment as a filling replacement would only increase my infection risk.\n\nWhat does anyone make of this? I have spent many hours doing (uninformed) research about this – whether this is chronic pain post-wisdom tooth extraction, tooth decay, nerve involvement from the fillings, sprained tooth syndrome. I am just a bit sceptical about the fact that I have experienced zero sensitivity with all this, and pain that is always associated with lying down flat. Literally every time I lie flat (either in bed or on sofa) I can feel the pain coming on within minutes. None of this appears to be common in any of the literature that I have read. The aching feels very much like toothache however I have been reassured by numerous x-rays that there is no evidence of tooth decay.\n\nAny thoughts on what the underlying problem is/what I should do what be of huge help.\n\nDan honestdoc: Did your dentist do a pulp/vitality test on the tooth in question?  How intense is your pain on 1 to 10 scale?  Are you experiencing any unresolved stress?  Maybe you can provide x-rays if possible? danzig: Hey, thanks for your response. Unfortunately I do not have access to the x-rays that have been taken, and no vitality/sensibility tests have been performed.  I would say the pain during the day time is 6/10, but at night/lying down is 9/10. This doesn't seem any different to me when compared to how it has been episodically for the past 4-5 years. honestdoc: If dentists aren't able to locate the dental source i.e. teeth/oral structures, it may be of neurological origins like trigeminal neuralgia.  You may visit a neurologist for possible evaluation. MattKW: Antibiotics are a waste of time. A pulp test is necessary as a minimum, and there is no such thing as a \"sprained\" ligament for teeth. I would get a second opinion - take along copies of your records including X-rays. Would love to see an X-rays posted up here. danzig: Thanks - to be fair though the sprained tooth syndrome was not something my dentist suggested, that was just part of my misguided research. Are pulp tests routinely performed as part of pre-assessment before root canal treatment? This wasn't suggested by my dentist. I've read that they aren't very reliable though - if I have a good response to vitality testing that could still represent a false reading and the vascular integrity could still actually be quite poor right?\n\nI think I will seek a second opinion. If I get access to the x-rays I will upload them here. MattKW: The other way around - you can get false negatives to pulp tests. So, if the dentist puts a cold pellet on your tooth and you feel it, then your tooth is still alive. If you don't feel it, then it may be dead (abscessed) OR it may be a tooth that doesn't feel cold easily - which is why it's important to also test adjacent teeth to get a baseline. honestdoc: Many inexperienced dentists use Q-tip instead of cotton pellet to test cold.  Q-tip does not get cold enough to get accurate results."

    "dialogue": "bellaboone0314: Hi, I had my first tooth extraction yesterday and after many hours, finally got the blood to clot in the wound, although I still have that bloody taste when my tongue hits the socket. My guess is it will stay that way until it's healed? \n\nMy question is about the dentist's instructions to rinse with salt/water 5x the following day. I've read that rinsing can cause the blood clots to dislodge and that could cause 'dry socket'. Is it safe to do this now? Also brushing - I'm afraid that will also dislodge the clots. Is there a really safe way to do both of these things to avoid dislodging the clots, or has enough time passed now that it doesn't matter? \n\nThanks! Cygre: The bloody taste is normal. Don't spit it out, though. You'll create a suction kind of pressure and pop the blood clot out. You could swallow, or rinse out with salt water.\n\nJust sort of gently swish it around, and gently let the liquid out. Dry socket usually happens with infection of the wound. As long as it's clean, you run a low risk of developing dry socket.\n\nSince 24 hours has passed, you can brush gently while avoiding the area of extraction. Don't spit the toothpaste out too forcefully. You should be able to resume cleaning the area of extraction for something like 3 days later. Meanwhile, don't poke around the wound with your tongue. It'll disturb the clot. joss: Sorry, but dry socket usually happens with dislodging the blood clot, not infection."

    "title": "Permanent crown nerve pain",
    "dialogue": "Sheena: When my temporary crown was placed it caused a lot of pain due to the crown not being cemented correctly and sitting too high. The dentist adjusted the temporary and re-cemented it and it felt 100% better. Today I had the permanent crown placed and felt so much nerve pain during the whole process. Now about 10 hours later I still feel constant nerve pain. My bite doesn’t feel off. The gums around the tooth don’t feel sore it’s just this intense nerve pain. I’m taking 800mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours just to manage. Is this normal? Why didn’t the temporary feel this bad? How long can I expect this nerve pain? It’s giving me the worst headache and I’m not even applying any pressure to the tooth. MattKW: Temporary crowns are usually glued with a soft cement containing eugenol, which also helps soothe tooth pain. The permanent cement for the real crown is different, and usually an acid-based reaction, and may also generate a bit of heat during setting, so can set off the sensitivity again.\nThere is about a 5-10% chance of crowned teeth not settling down, and requiring a root canal therapy. You'll just have to dose for another day and hope it settles more. honestdoc: How you know you need a root canal is if the pain is waking you up at night and or you notice swelling around the crown.  Getting crowns involve drilling around the tooth which traumatizes/injures the nerve (pulp).  The nerve will hopefully get better or get permanently damaged or dies. Sheena: The gums aren’t swollen but still need to take 800 ibuprofen every 6 hours to eleviate the pain. How long does it usually take for the nerves to recover? honestdoc: It is hard to predict the duration and intensity of your pain.  A last resort idea may be to discuss the possible use of corticosteroid dose pack like prednisone, medrol, or decadron with your dentist.  What these medications do is reduce inflammation of the nerves in your tooth more effectively than ibuprofen.  However, there are many contraindications and side effects for these agents because it suppresses your immune system and if you have any pre-existing conditions, it could be risky/dangerous.  \n\nIf your pain is significant, you may need a root canal to remove the damaged nerves in your tooth. Sheena: So it’s been over a week. I went back on Tuesday to get the crown adjusted. Now the pain is less but I still get the nerve pain that travels to my head and ear if I don’t take something. I don’t have to take as much pain medicine as I was but I’m still taking Tylenol every 6 hours. Does it sound like it’s on the track of healing or potential root canal? What’s so frustrating is my tooth had no pain prior to this whole crown procedure. I have a crack in my tooth and now pain honestdoc: Hopefully the tooth feels cold of short duration (nerve is vital) and not waking you at night (nerve is damaged).   Damaged nerve presents as intense unbearable pain. Sheena: Could I have an abscess? When my tooth hurts it hurts pretty bad and spreads to my ear and temple on the same side of my toothache. Ibuprofen and Tylenol successfully relieve the pain but it is strongest when I’m eating something that requires a lot of chewing. Sheena: Sorry for some many questions but my dentist isn’t very helpful. I may find another dentist for a 2nd opinion. MattKW: If you're getting hot or cold sensitivity then you have an angry pulp (nerve), but no abscess. However, here we are nearly 2 weeks post-op and you're still dosing with painkillers. You're almost certainly going to need an RCT; this is not going to settle down."

I found some worrying comments on the web. Also, I usually use mouthwash before going to sleep. Since the production of saliva is lower during the night, the impact of mouthwash could be even stronger as there is less saliva to dilute it. So, I am a bit confused of how to properly use and whether to use mouthwash, e.g., Listerine. Please let me know if you have any advice on this topic.

    "dialogue": "Z994: hi,\n\nI had a filling in my first molar almost 5 weeks ago and yesterday I started to feel pain when drinking and eating. The pain is instantaneous and i stop feeling it immediately after i stop.\n\nIs this a normal thing?\nI brush my teeth almost 2 a day (sometimes i forget the second time) and floss almost everyday.\n\nWhat is happening? honestdoc: There is usually drilling involved to fill the tooth.  After drilling, the nerve (pulp) gets traumatized depending on how big and deep the cavity is.  The sign of a healthy nerve response is cold sensitivity of short duration.  Your teeth is telling you that too much cold can damage the nerve so try not to overwhelm it. Z994: I also feel the pain for very hot drinks. Is it normal to feel this type of pain when you had a filling more than a month ago? honestdoc: With sensitivity to hot, the tooth may be needing a root canal treatment.  Have your dentist check it out. MattKW: I always tell patients if I expect them to have some pain afterwards, and for how long. Anything more than a week is of concern. But I also tend to do amalgams in the bigger cavities because there is much less risk of post-op pain than composites. A lousy amalgam can work in lots of messy and difficult situations whereas a composite needs careful placement under ideal conditions. Z994: I went to the dentist yesterday and she tested it, and she took x-rays too. she told me there is not sings of any need for root canal and the cause may be hyper sysitivity. I am doing a follow up in two weeks. \n\nI have the x-rays too, I am posting them here. can you tell me if you notice anything. honestdoc: I'm not seeing anything significant.  I believe you have hypersensitivity.  Avoid and minimize temperature exposure. Z994: Thanks a lot! Really appreciated MattKW: Nothing special. It's hard to gauge the depth of the filling because this is an angled X-ray (a PA). You can always try a desensitising toothpaste but it may take a week to kick in. If still no significant relief then I would redo the filling as a first step. You could use composite again, but seeing as it's an upper tooth that's not very visible, I'd tend towards an amalgam the 2nd time around."

I've been back to the dentist a couple times since the extraction the most recent being 5 days ago (1 week following the extraction). She said there was no sign of infection or dry socket but that the  wound was healing a bit slower than she would like to see, she re-induced some bleeding to hopefully help this process.\n\nIt's now been 12 days total since the tooth was pulled and I'm still getting the same dull throbbing pain in the extraction area. It's especially bad if I have to bend over to pick something up, or if I have to run/jog briefly. Sometimes it feels like its coming from the teeth near it or above it on the top. \n\nAt this point I've convinced myself that either a) I pulled the wrong tooth to begin with or b) its going to throb for the rest of time.\n\nIs it possible for it still to subside at this point? Two weeks seems like a long time for just regular healing and pain to subside given that there are supposedly no other complications in play.\n\nAny thoughts? MattKW: Check other teeth, and don't forget to look at top ones too. honestdoc: Have your medical evaluate for possible sinus pain.  Tooth pain when bending over, run/jog, walking up & downstairs can indicate possible sinusitis. Daniel.S: Surrounding and opposing teeth were tested today via percussion test, with nothing found as far as that is concerned. They did mention sinus's but didn't seem to think that would be a factor because of no percussion sensitivity. I don't feel \"congested\" at all...but perhaps a trip to my GP would be worth exploring. \n\nAs far as my dentist can tell the extraction has been healing well and shouldn't be causing me problems at this point, so certainly a secondary factor seems to be in play...\n\nThanks for the reply's - the communication helps a lot with my health anxiety! Daniel.S: Remarkably 18 days after the extraction I'm finally starting to feel much better. I guess everyone's body is truly unique. To anyone else out there like me who tends to look at typical healing times and create anxiety and pressure for yourself based on it.

She did do percussion tests the last time I was there, but I didn't have any pain and there wasn't sensitivity to cold. I should mention that the filling was redone because I had a back piece of my last molar break off in June, they say from clenching. That spot in my tooth looks dark to me, do you think that could be causing the pain? MattKW: Darkness may not mean anything at all, and doesn't justify treatment on its own. You have to look at all the factors before making a treatment decision. When you say it wasn't sensitive to cold, did she use cold spray, or just blow air? And did she compare the response from a number of teeth? This is the assessment guide I use. GeorgeNelson1989: So a lot has occurred since I last posted here...and I'm still having pain.\n\nI went back to the dentist on October 31st and had the first part of a crown procedure done. I was in a lot of pain after that procedure so I ended up going back in a week later on November 7th and the endodontist said I should do a root canal. They squeezed me in that day. Since then, the pain has been worse, and pretty much constant. It's all in the left side of my jaw/tooth. I've been on amoxicillin & clindamycin since this all started, now done with both. On Monday 11/26, endo told me to see a periodontist to make sure nothing is wrong with the gums. I went there today 11/28, and she said she didn't see any signs of infection or gum disease. I'm going back to my regular dentist tomorrow to get the permanent crown put on my root canal'd 2nd molar. I'm attaching various x-rays taken over the last few months...and I'm wondering if anyone sees anything? After I left today I noticed a dark spot on one of the x-rays...I pointed to it with an arrow on the attached image. If anyone has any insight, that would be great...\n\nMy main question at this point is...why am I still in pain?\n\n(The pain is in my left back molar, and underneath the left side of my jaw. At times it radiates to the back of my head, up to my temple, and down the front/side my neck. It's a dull aching that lasts pretty much all day, but doesn't wake me up at night. It's usually better in the morning and gets worse as the day goes on.) honestdoc: My first impression of that dark spot is normal bone trabeculae.  It doesn't appear like a cyst or similar and other images just doesn't confirm anything.  The root canal looks good.  Has your pain changed after the root canal procedure or remains the same?  The radiating pain on lower left jaw and neck area may be remotely cardiovascular.  You may check with your physician to rule that out...hopefully not a heart attack. MattKW: This is not adding up. I was surprised to see that you've ended up with an RCT, but it's hard to assess in a forum where we can't test teeth ourselves and have to rely upon what you can tell  us. Antibiotics were probably unjustified, as there never seemed to be evidence of a ful-blown infection.\nA nice-looking RCT. The darkness is probably submand gland depression and all looks quite OK."

    "dialogue": "zormelo: Hi,\nI have a strange problem with a tooth that has been stumping a few dentists. It is on the bottom second from the right. It had a few filling, one was deep and close to the nerve. When I chew softly on it the tooth is ok, but when I chew hard it hurts for about 15 minutes. If I continue eventually the gum gets very sore between it and the tooth on the end. They thought it might be uneven on the top, filing down on edge helped a bit. Another dentist decided the tooth was fractured and put on an orthodontic band, but this had no effect. The pain feels more like it is under the tooth, like pressing down hurts there. honestdoc: Have your dentist periodontally probe for attachment loss and have you bite on a tooth sleuth.  After biting onto a tooth sleuth, if you notice pain upon release, it may indicate fracture.  If your tooth feels cold, then it should be vital.  If it doesn't, the tooth may be necrotic and needs root canal or extraction.\n\nIf the tooth is intact and vital with no attachment loss, consider crown.  Also consider a bite guard as you may be grinding and or clenching. zormelo: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHave your dentist periodontally probe for attachment loss and have you bite on a tooth sleuth.

Gum recession and pain from frequent infections mean that my health has suffered as well as my confidence. But I am still worried about going ahead with this. Has anyone who's been through the extractions and has complete dentures any advice or encouragement that can help me make the decision to get false teeth? MattKW: Sometimes you can try having partial dentures first by saving a few teeth, even if only for a couple of more years It can help you get used to them before taking out all teeth. \nEven keeping a couple of lower teeth can be very helpful.

That's very good advice which I should have taken several years ago, but is not an option any more. I guess I'll just have to go for the first stage now. honestdoc: There are 2 types of dentures you can discuss with your dentist.  One is called immediate dentures where they make your dentures before your teeth gets extracted.  After your teeth are extracted, the dentist will fit the completed dentures.  The disadvantage is that the immediates don't fit as accurate due to the changes in bone and gums after teeth extraction.  After about 6 months of mouth changes, the denture may be relined but may still have limitations.  You may have to consider a new denture depending on how ill-fitting it is.  \n\nThe other type of denture is waiting until all of the mouth changes are stabilized after 3-6 months to fabricate the denture.  This type is definitely more accurate and better fitting.  But you will be without the denture until it gets fabricated.  You can consider doing both which is double the work and cost.

    "title": "Gum recession and the art of worrying way too much",
    "dialogue": "Jkr91: Hello everybody\n\n\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I have been diagnosed with severe OCD, which means I worry... A LOT! Overthinking and worrying way more than I need to is what I do best. And this might also tie in to my current problem, which is why I'm mentioning it.\n\n\n\nSo for the past 2 years or so, I've realised that I suffer quite a bit from gum recession. I gotta be honest, up untill two years ago I had no idea that you could brush your teeth in a wrong way much less that you could actively damage both your teeth and gums by doing so. So for the first 25 years of my life I brushed way too hard and probably used the wrong tooth brush a large part of the time. As a result, my gums are receding. Nowadays, I am extremely careful that I brush as gently as possible while also using a soft toothbrush. However, I can't help but feel that the problem is still getting worse. I am currently seeing a gum specialist (I assume such a person has a special name that I am not aware of), but for the past 2-3 months I have been worrying A LOT about my gums. If they just stay the way they are now, I can easily live with that - I just don't want it to get worse! However, at the same time I also feel like it actually IS getting worse, because I feel like more and more of my teeth are starting to hurt. It's gotten to the point where I genuinely anxious to brush my teeth, because I feel like even the slighest touch of the gums is going to worsen the problem. Now here's my question: Is it possible that I, beacause I worry and overthink so much, feel the pain BECAUSE of that and not because it has actually gotten worse? Is it possible that the pain is all (or atleast mostly) in my head? Have any of you dentist worked with patients who felt this way before? Or do I just have to face the fact that it is actually getting worse by the day?\n\nThank you. honestdoc: I can understand your worries.  What you're experiencing happened to me before I went to Dental School.  I brushed so hard that I have severe toothbrush abrasion and gum recession.  This was about 25 years ago.  After my discovery, my gums haven't receded.  I do have an anterior open bite so my lower incisors have hyper-erupted.  I tried to manage my open-bite as well as grinding and clenching with a custom bite guard.  \n\nI would find the softest bristle toothbrush.  I like the Sunstar GUM previously made by Butler in a compact head and with a \"Super tip.\"  I also use a Sonicare.  Other people like the reciprocating spin head of the Oral B and I have that unopened as well.  MAKE SURE your bristles aren't flattening when you are finished...the bristles on your brush head should look new when you throw out after 3-4 months use.  If they are flattening after use, you are causing damage.\n\nLook into a custom bite guard as well.  With OCD, you may be grinding and/or clenching and not know it.  You can cause a lot of teeth and joint damage if you are."

I had a root canal done to it and stuff, I'm now noticing that the tooth has moved up further in to my gum. What  would have to be done and also how much would it cost? Any help or insight would be appreciated thanks. honestdoc: I'm suspecting possible external root resorption.  The dentist will have to take an x-ray and study the root & bone anatomy.  Most likely prepare for possible bone graft and implant. MattKW: Most likely it has ankylosed (locked into the bone) and undergone surface resorption. Your other teeth may have grown down a bit and the ankylosed tooth has stayed in same position. Replantation of knocked out teeth is not often worth it anymore except as a very short term measure. Be prepared to have it extracted and at least a 1-tooth denture for the moment. Long term probably an implant, although you could be lucky and have a Marylands bridge (unlikely)."

    "dialogue": "Trac: Hi, does anyone know of approx. cost of filling to lower teeth?\nThanks! honestdoc: It depends on your location and number of surfaces for the filling. Trac: Many thanks – the location is bottom jaw  tooth into the gum area (lower right on pic) – not sure why a filling has been suggested for this area – dentist said she would try a filling rather than gum graft (which terrified me) – the purpose of filling is to fill a rupture in my gum next to root of tooth. I’m not sure if this rupture could heal itself.\nis this something I can get on NHS? I assume the filling would need to be white to match my teeth honestdoc: I'm sorry, I have a hard time seeing the image.  Could you get a couple of closer views?  You may be traumatizing your gums by brushing too hard.  Try to spend more time and brush less aggressive and use a soft bristled toothbrush. honestdoc: In the US, the cost of dental work varies even within the same metropolitan area.  The same dental labs that fabricate crowns and other prosthetics charge dentists according to how affluent their zip codes are.  I'm not sure how costly it is in the UK, but it varies so much here.  \n\nThe US also utilizes numerous 3rd party dental insurance and each has its own discounted fees. Trac: Many thanks this is really useful - I think it could be caused by brushing trauma but there is also much plaque around by lower teeth so I was wondering if this would eventually impact the root  - I have started to take cordysal mouthwash and have started to use Oral B Pro gum and enamel tooth repair paste but I don't think this will heal the gum - my upper teeth seem to be better than my lower in terms of plaque and I think the only way to clear this plaque on lower teeth is to have a scale and polish\n\nhere is an image - hope you can see the bit I am talking about - 2nd tooth from right, ugly! - can you see the root of tooth and then the trauma point? The dentist has suggested putting a filling there - Ive no idea about dentistry but I assume this will make my tooth appear longer - she then suggested root canal and mentioned a gum graft......many thanks Trac:  honestdoc: I agree that you will need a filling.  In the US, I would code for a 1 surface anterior composite filling.  You may need a gum graft.  Before considering a gum graft, you and your dentist need to figure out why you are having gum damage there or the future graft will fail. \n\nFirst, do you have any medical conditions such as auto immune disorder, immune deficiencies, diabetes, or heart conditions?  Are you taking any significant medications, blood thinning agents, and/or herbals supplements?  Second, I recommend using Sonicare or Oral B electric toothbrush.  You should not have any plaque left there or any grafts will fail.  You need to brush more gentle but thorough.\n\nIf you have an anterior open bite where your lower teeth are not touching your upper teeth, your lower teeth may continue to hyper-erupt.  I personally have this condition. Trac: Many thanks this is so helpful and I appreciate your time and advice.\n\nMy dentist has quoted this (I am in the UK) £135 for composite filling (that’s the one that I have indicated on photo  and talking about here) but if root canal is required it would be from £114-£360 depending on roots or referral to specialist.....\n\nI can’t recall how this happened – it may have been with a manual toothbrush and in the past I have been rather heavy handed – I now have am Oral B electric with round head and I have started to use Cordsaol mouth wash and significantly cut down on my sugar snacking\n\nIve not idea what root canal involves but I’m hoping I won’t need it that it can be prevented with filling but not sure – I guess only my dentist would know.\n\nWhat is an open bite and  hypereruption? Gosh my teeth are ugly\n\nMuch thanks for your help though – I shall keep poste what happens Trac: My plan also includes 2 posterior composite fillings!..so the numbers are all adding up to pounds £!\nI wonder if I should get a second opinion? honestdoc: The fees for the filling is more expensive than I thought.  Our price is $160.  I don't keep track of fees since most of my patients get government assistance.  Hopefully you don't need root canal.  How you know you need one is if the pain keeps you up at night and or swelling.  Many times you don't know you need it but the x-ray indicates some disease at the root tip usually after a history of trauma and or large cavity/filling on the suspect tooth.\n\nTry to brush more gentle yet thorough.  Anterior open bite is when your back and side teeth comes together but your front teeth don't (they don't touch).  Teeth erupt until they hit the opposing so with open bite, there may be hyper-eruption.  My lower anteriors have erupted higher than the back teeth and they still aren't touching.  I wear a custom bite guard to protect against grinding and clenching and to minimize their hyper-eruption. Trac: Many thanks, so helpful and informative.\n\nI hope I don’t need a gum graft – I shall book appointment for filling.\n\nI do use an Oral B electric brush – is the Sonicare better>\n\nI have been brushing morning and night and flossing. I am using Oral B gum and enamel repair alongside an oral B waxed fluoride floss! I am impressed with this toothpaste.\n\nI hope to have the filling done within the month.\n\nI read something about ‘oil pulling’ to help teeth and gums and was wondering your thoughts on this method?\n\nI have read that coconut, olive or sunflower oil can be used  and must be swilled around mouth/teeth for 5-20 minutes and then spit out. Also is it best to brush before oil pulling or after? I read that before is best as to leave the natural bacteria in mouth???\n\nI am also going to book in for a dental hygiene session – a scale and polish and will ask the hygienist if they can assess the state of my gums.\n\nI believe in UK we can ask for NHS prices or private. Those rates were for private.\n\nI really hope I don’t need root canal and will try all possibilities to avoid this route! ‘Oil pulling’ seems to be a good option to try something holistic. It’s worth trying!\n\nI have no pain in tooth but I think the xray showed some weak point at root area.\n\nYes, I do have anterior bite! Now I know the name of it this helps! I shall look into a bie guard – do I wear this at night? Do I need to get one measured up?\n\nI shall keep you updated on my progress.\n\nMany thanks! MooChi: Hi, I have just found your post. I'm new on here but just wanted to ask how you got on?\n\nDid the oil pulling help as I have been considering it for my loose teeth. Figure it can't make anything worse at least right?!"

Usually when I would go to the dentist, they might find 0-2 cavities (maybe because my diet is low in sugar). Anyways, after the scraping and polishing my teeth would always look nice and white and feel smooth.. However, I haven't been to the dentist in maybe 3 years and probably can't go for a while, but I want to take steps to be able to improve my teeth as much as I can in the meantime.\n\nI bought a basic set of dental tools on Amazon and am shopping for a good mouthwash. But my question is about if it's appropriate to use the tools on my teeth, considering their condition. I just wanted to double check that this substance is indeed plaque and scrap-able. I see this yellowish buildup on top two front teeth (8, 9) and similarly at the base/up the sides of the front bottom teeth (#23-26).  Somehow today either when I was brushing or flossing a good chuck of it came off the front tooth, exposing a nice white underneath it that matches the rest of the tooth. After I noticed this I used the back-end of a floss stick trying to get some of the bottom tooth and I manage to get piece off that was brittle and crumbled easily from the friction from my fingers. I attached a picture. I couldn't seem to get a picture that didn't have glare and thus colors are a bit inaccurate. But you can see the places where I chipped off the (presumable) plaque. The \"C\" or crescent shaped moon on the top-left front tooth and then directly below it on the inside part (closest to center line) of the bottom tooth. It seems kinda deep on that bottom tooth but I think it's just a solid layer of plaque?\n\nThanks for reading! honestdoc: What are the reasons you haven't gone to the dentist?  Was it time, money/insurance coverage, anxiety, etc?  I notice some gum inflammation on your lower anteriors.  If you can overcome your obstacle(s) of seeing a dentist, get your mouth checked with x-rays and gum probings to check for gum disease and attachment loss.  Gum disease can be very deteriorating and can lead to tooth loss.  In addition to checking your gums, the dentist will also check for cavities and possible mouth cancer.  Earlier this year, I had encountered a lady with her left side of her face swollen and she felt numb in the area.  She had the swelling for ~4 months and x-ray revealed an aggressive tumor invading her left jaw bone fracturing it.  She had no teeth on that side and the bone was already thin.  The tumor and swelling was so severe, she couldn't move her head or open her mouth very well.  She had a hard time eating and presented with fever and severe malnutrition, I estimated she had less than 2 weeks to live."

    "dialogue": "HRTR: Bear with me on the many details!\n\nI'm 23 years old and went to the dentist early this year for my first cleaning in quite awhile. I found out (yes this sounds crazy that I didn't know before) that I genetically don't have wisdom teeth or my second molars on my jaw. I have second molars on the top and my wisdom teeth on the top never came in.\n\nAt my first cleaning the dentist said my teeth looked great, but my second molars erupted and are pretty low. He claimed that while my teeth are great, it was pushing my teeth forward slightly and that getting invisalign or braces would push back the teeth and in turn pull up the supraeruption. He said I wouldn't have any issues though until I'm 40-50.\n\nA few weeks later I ended up going back for an unrelated visit and I saw a second dentist at the practice. She said that the supraeruption was not pushing my teeth forward and that it's possible to just put a brace on the two second molars and pull them up. Or, I could wear a mouthguard at night and it would provide 8hours of an opposition and help prevent it moving down more. She said invisalign wouldn't help and she didn't seem to concerned.\n\nI just went for another cleaning today and the third dentist I've seen at this office had a completely different opinion. He said that there is no way to pull it back up using a brace. He said I should have it filed down, crowns placed in, and dental implants put on the bottom. That is quite a bit of surgery and money and totally different from what the other two dentists said. I'm concerned about receiving dental implants when there were never molars or wisdom teeth in that spot before and idk if the bone could handle that. It's very expensive and there are a lot of risks with all of that work. I'm also concerned that I have three different opinions from this office when each of them said they've never seen a case with a person genetically not having bottom second molars. I also asked today if they would grow down anymore and he said no because they're already hitting the gums. So would it even be worth getting it fixed if I've had this for years, am not in pain, never had second molars and it's already hitting my gums? What would be the best way to fix it if it's absolutely necessary?\n\nThanks! HRTR: Here are the pictures as example. This is how it is on both sides MattKW: Your teeth are not being pushed forward.\nYou cannot push the 2nd molars back up.\nYou cannot simply crown those 2nd molars without killing the nerve and doing RCTs. It's possible to deliberately do an RCT and then a crown to change the height, and I've done it, but there have to be exceptional reasons, and there are risks.\n\nIf you did 3., then you definitely need to follow up with lower implants ASAP or the upper 2nd molars will come down again.\nIf the rest of your teeth are in good health, especially the 1st molars, just take out those useless 2nd molars. You'll function quite OK without them.

My first thought was either to leave the 2nd molars since they're not causing me pain or have them pulled if it ever did become an issue. The second dentist I saw seemed concerned about pulling them at a young age, saying there could then be bone loss and it could shift my other teeth or cause issues.

What treatment do you think will need to be given? MattKW: Dec 5th isn't far away for this sort of problem. This is going to be a large cavity, and you'll probably escape with a large filling. In the long term, this will be a very weakened tooth and an eventual fracture and extraction is likely. The decay appears to go under the gum level, so you won't have much hope of placing a crown.

Went to the dentist today and they cleared the decay and placed a temporary filling in until the 5th December. Do you know how far in the future it’ll be when I have to have my tooth extracted if that’s the case? I’m just self conscious because it’s noticeable when I smile. MattKW: No idea. At least the temporary will help to prevent any pain. honestdoc: We can't predict how far into the future but you will know when to extract the tooth.  If you experience intense pain that wakes you from sleep, it means the nerve (root canal) is damaged.  If you notice swelling, it means the nerve died and became infected.  If you are eating your favorite foods like crispy bread and the tooth broke off, then you know it is time.  \n\nGet all of your teeth checked and establish good dental habits & diet to minimize these unfortunate conditions."

    "dialogue": "Enamel: Hello people,\n\nI have a history of receding gums and inflammations. I have it mainly on the teeth, so now also the ignition especially there. I am from The Netherlands.\n\nA week or two ago I had a clear gum inflammation in which there was even spontaneous blood from the gums of 1 tooth. The rest of my gum was also inflamed. I am traveling in the coming months and when this happened I was in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I went to a dentist there and the practice looked very old and dirty. The doctor's coat also had stains. In short, it looked unreliable and it was a bad experience.\n\nHe said that I indeed had an inflammation and prescribed Peroxide gel for me (30 ml / 32g, 0.2%). He did not clean anything or anything like that. I have used this drug for a week and it looks like it is not gone.\n\nMy question to you is whether you can see from the pictures below whether the inflammation is already gone? The first picture is in the morning before brushing and the second picture is after brushing. If there is still an inflammation, should I go to another (better) dentist abroad to clean it or something similar? Or can I treat it better and if so, how? With saltwater rinsing it looks like the gums are becoming whiter. Maybe I put too much salt in it (1.5 tsp salt for 1 sip of water).\n\nI now brush my teeth at least twice a day and I have been using an interdental brush since months ago to clean between the teeth. Furthermore, I always have a white tongue, even though I always my tongue with the my electric toothbrush. Perhaps it is because I regularly sleep with my mouth open.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nin the morning before brushing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust after brushing: honestdoc: In general, inflammed gums look bright to dark red and swollen looking.  In between teeth papilla for inflammed gums will appear loose.  Your gums look light pink and tight.  I noticed some abfraction damage from possible grinding/traumatic biting.  Many times stress could induce grinding/clenching especially during extensive travel.\n\nThe only way to diagnose gum disease is to take x-rays to evaluate bone levels and perio probe to check for attachment loss.  I don't recommend peroxide.  It has the potential to irritate and cause mucosal damage.  If your attachment loss is ~5 mm and greater, consider 0.12% Chorhexidine rinse for 2 to 4 weeks.  Prolonged use can discolor you teeth.  Be careful not to brush too hard.  You will know if your soft bristles are flattening after use.  You can cause permanent gum & teeth damage."

    "dialogue": "Slobo: Hello,\n\nI am using Curaprox ultra-soft and super-soft toothbrush (I alternate between them). I was wondering what is rule of thumb on which to choose? For instance, is there any reason to always prefer one over the other. Also, do they have some type of RDA value? \n\nI would appreciate any advice along these lines. Thanks.\n\nBest, honestdoc: For me, the rule of thumb for getting a toothbrush is how comfortable is it to use and how likely is it you will continue to use it.  It would be worthless if your hygienist/dentist recommends something that you have a hard time using.  Before I became a dentist, I used to brush very hard and have damaged enamel and receding gums so it is important for me to use a comfortable and soft toothbrush.  I like Sunstar Gum (previously by Butler) soft compact head with the Super tip.  I find Oral B soft manual toothbrushes to be too hard and previously used their extra soft/sensitive gum bristles which is harder to get.  I also use Sonicare brushes for the past 15 years (my previous clinic sells them) and have great results.  I have an unopened Oral B electric given by a rep and will use it in the near future.  Another dentist in the forum Dr. MattKW likes Oral B's reciprocating brush head and he gets good results with them.  It is like buying a daily use car/motorbike/bicycle/etc...find one you feel comfortable to use every day.\n\nAnother rule of thumb is to not brush too hard.  People think the harder you brush, the more clean and whiter your teeth gets.  Spend more time being thorough but gentle.  You know you brush too hard when your bristles are flattening after you are finished.  I tell people that when you throw out your toothbrush or electric brush head after 3-4 months, the bristles should still look straight and not flattening out.  You can damage your teeth and gums like I did if they are flattening. Slobo: Thanks a lot! This is a great piece of advice."

    "title": "Dental cleaning concerns",
    "dialogue": "WorryPot: Hi all\n\nI realise I may be overthinking things, but just wanted to get some advice.\n\nI’m 30 years old and have had all my wisdom teeth out. I’ve never had any issues with my teeth growing up and so I really don’t have a fear of the dentist generally (although I do admit being a bit neurotic at times!) I brush regularly and floss, I avoid sugary foods/drinks etc, and am pretty meticulous with my teeth. However, I did start smoking again this year. \n\nOrdinarily I would see my dentist every six months but on this occasion a year had gone by (a relative fell ill and passed away and so it’s been a tough year in general). I went in for a routine check up and clean. The dentist said my gums were looking good overall but that there was one spot where my gums were receding a little, and gave me a bit of a talk about brushing and suggested I start using piksters. No worries. \n\nThe dental hygienist then gave me a clean and suggested i come back in a week. She didn’t really say why, but, hey, I do what I’m told. I got a bit worried about this, because I’ve never been asked to come back like this after a clean, but I figured this must just be their protocol or something.\n\nI’d been extra careful about brushing and flossing and started using piksters, and wasn’t worried about the upcoming appointment. A different dentist saw me (apparently my usual dentist was off sick) and she said she doesn’t normally work at this practice. She had a look at my teeth, agreed that there was some receding, but that this was in a completely different area to the one the other dentist mentioned. She then suggested I come back again in another two weeks. She said she’d  book me with my usual hygienist, but struggled a bit with the computer software, so she said she’d book the appointment for an hour but that it wouldn’t take that long. It would just be another check up. Again, I’m a bit worried by now, because I’ve never been asked to come back after a scale and clean, let alone twice. I spend the next two weeks continuing to be really careful about brushing my teeth. \n\nTwo weeks later I go in for my appointment and a fourth dentist comes and gets me. I didn’t ask why she was seeing me and not my usual hygienist. She immediately says we are doing another clean that day, which is not really the information I had been given two weeks prior. But whatever, fine, I’m happy to get another clean if they think I need it. It seems to be like a usual clean, just a lot more thorough and more painful than I’m used to. This whole thing goes for about 45 mins. She tells me there’s only a thin layer of plaque but that it’s quite tenacious. I was honest in the paperwork that I had started smoking again, but felt quite embarrassed when she asked me if I was a smoker. I wondered if it must be obvious that I smoke, even though this has never been raised as an issue before. She tells me that smoking doesn’t cause plaque but that it dries your mouth out and hardens plaque a lot quicker. She tells me I have “lovely teeth” and I nearly burst into tears, because how can that be true if I’ve now been asked to come back twice and needed to get a second clean. She encourages me to book an appointment for another clean in four months, which I realize is a shorter time than usual. By now I’m totally confused and worried I have some serious disease they are not telling me about. \n\nWhen I get home from the appointment my gums are sore all over, but this passes for the most part after an hour. Except for in one corner where my wisdom tooth used to be. I noticed this little hole which was the source of the pain, and figured she must have stabbed me accidentally with that little hook thing they use. It’s now been five days and the pain is still there. I’ve been brushing the area more than usual, flossing etc and when I stick the pikster in there it bleeds. I had no issues with bleeding gums before all this started. \n\nIt’s the last thing I want to do, but I’m wondering if I need to go back in to get this soreness checked out. I know googling your symptoms isn’t a good idea, but I’ve been reading all this stuff about abscesses so now I’m worried that’s what I have back there. Mostly I’m just confused about what all this fuss is about. I thought that maybe I’m brushing and flossing too hard, but the third dentist assured me this isn’t the problem. \n\nI would really welcome any thoughts or advice!! MattKW: Plaque is rarely tenacious, although it can become quite sticky - it's usually seen in grotty teenage boys! However, subgingival calculus (tartar) can be rightly described as tenacious, and you'll see it as dark margins under your gums. This is usually seen in patients who don't get regular cleaning and don't maintain hygiene - this doesn't sound like you at all.\nHowever, we all pick up extrinsic stains from foods, and obviously smoking. It's fairly easy to spot a smoker from the distribution of stains. That said, such staining might be unattractive, but it is not harmful, and it reforms quickly. It can take a bloody long time to take it all off. I don't always take it all off unless someone requests it.\nI think this is what has most likely happened to you. You've gotten into the hands of an over-zealous dentist or hygienist who has probably thoroughly cleaned your teeth, more than was necessary for your health. Repeated scaling and cleaning will damage your teeth, so I would go back to your usual check-up schedule with your usual dentist. But still keep working on giving up the fags. honestdoc: It is not ideal to constantly see different providers.  You don't have the continuity of care and you hear different and confusing opinions and suggestions.  I worked at various group practices where the dentists are always leaving and a new, inexperienced one would take over.  Try to find an experienced dentist that has been at the same location for a while (may be a rare case, he/she may be very popular and booked way out).  Hopefully you will feel comfortable with the dentist and stick with him or her.  When you are booking your next visit, make sure you know who you are seeing.  If you see a new dentist for any reason and not sure about the treatment, reschedule with your preferred dentist.\n\nFor example, I work with a lot of inexperienced and other part-time dentists, and many don't do surgery and root canals.  The inexperienced dentists may see emergency patients in pain.  Very quickly they will refer or \"dump\" those cases to me charting the wrong tooth and wrong diagnosis.  In many instances, the pain does not require root canals or extraction.  After their initial visit, almost all of the referred patients wanted me to be their dentist because I listened, asked many questions and can perform the referred difficult procedures.

Upon further inspection I noticed there seemed to be a crack at the 'bottom' of the tooth where it protrudes from my gums (from being pushed so far back behind my other teeth).

Hopefully photos to follow. Cheers Toothy2:  Toothy2:  Toothy2:  Toothy2: The redness is probably from aggressive brushing to keep it clean. MattKW: Looks like a previously root-filled tooth that was given a final restoration of a big white composite. That is hopeless, and should be extracted ASAP. The teeth either side of the gap are heavily filled, and I would therefore suggest a bridge rather than an implant so that you get the additional benefit of strengthening the adjacent teeth. The redness is simply inflamed gum. Just keep it as reasonably clean as you can, and prepare for an extraction when you visit the dentist - eat a good meal beforehand, have some painkillers ready to go straight after the extraction, plan a quiet day at home. Toothy2: Thanks, good idea about the bridge. Yeah I'm the generation where brushing wasn't well promoted and the motto was drillem and fillem... \nInteresting to see how the amalgam is more or less still holding together but the 'new improved' ceramic has cracked and shrunk (?).

Toothy2: Well... actually there is a localish dentist an hour or so away BUT (off the record !) he's not very good, especially at extractions, he doesn't have a very good reputation lol, so I'd rather wait til I can get to see my regular dentist  \nBut someone has mentioned having him take any sharp edges off and apply some glassionomer until I get to the city, any thoughts ? MattKW: The brown stuff is stain and plaque. At the most, I'd have the edges smoothed off. If you try and cover it with something like GIC, there is a chance you'll set off a problem. Let sleeping dogs lie... Toothy2: Cheers,\nthe edges are not sharp or annoying me, and my tonuge will be fine if I get over my obsession with licking it. I brush twice daily but would putting a dab of flouride toothpaste or tea-tree or cove oil on it at night be of any benefit ? \nIt is not sore at all and I'll be careful not to chew on it, just so it lasts 2-3 weeks before getting to town. if it did start to flare up whats something I could do quickly to mitigate.\nI'd like to compliment you on your helpfulness, thanks. MattKW: No benefit. If it flares up in pain, then simple painkillers. But I think it might already be dead, so this is unlikely."

There is no pain, but I was wanting to know if it is just staining. If so, how can I fix it. I went to a dentist this past Tuesday and he did not mention it, but I'd like your opinions as well. Thank you honestdoc: Your dentist will have a better look at it.  From the image, it looks like you have a filling which developed a stain or possible recurrent cavity.  Either way, you may need a new filling."

    "title": "Constant flow of  teeth problems",
    "dialogue": "anthonytcollege: Hello everyone. I have been having problems with my teeth for the past three months.\n\nThen: Early June i started having throbbing pain on one of my lower front teeth. After going to the dentist it was revealed that I had a serious root infection. The dentist took care of that problem, but the same day it healed and stopped bothering me, my furthest back, bottom left molar started hurting. Turns out, that the filling I had there had been cracked for some time, allowing it to develop decay, which resulted in yet another root infection. Since the dentist that had done the filling basically bridged my two molars with one big filling, instead of individual fillings, they both had broken fillings and required crowns (on top of one needing a root canal). A month later after that was fixed, and weekly visits for adjustments since it would start hitting shortly after they adjust the crowns , my wisdom teeth started hurting, along with the molars above the two molars previously mentioned.\n\nNow: Wisdom teeth pulled, and crowns made, I now am having soreness on a older crown on the opposite side of my mouth, close to one of the wisdom teeth sites. The dentist believed it was due to having 4 crowns (currently with temps) on the opposite side, causing me to bite more on my right side, causing it to be sore. My questions is, the soreness comes even if I do not eat on that side, and it shifts from the front molar (the one with the crown from years ago), to the back of my second molar, and finally to the back of the extraction site of the wisdom teeth.\n\nThe wisdom teeth extraction was done 2 weeks ago, and the crowns on the top left molars done 1 week ago.\n\nI went to the dentist again this past Tuesday, and he could not find anything wrong, other then a small spot I could be hitting in, which he adjusted. It may be me being incredibly paranoid that it's another infection, or decay not being seen, but I don't understand how it could become sore on it's own, if I have not been eating on it since yesterday morning.\n\nAlso, June was the time of my last cleaning, and x-rays didn't show anything on the teeth currently giving me problems.\n\nWhat could it be, if not decay? What do you suggest I do / Ask my dentist to do? honestdoc: Try an over the counter bite guard.  If you are noticing improvement, consider having your dentist fabricate a custom hard&soft bite guard after all crowns and fillings are completed.  You may be experiencing stress, change of daily routine, job and/or school, deadlines, etc. anthonytcollege: Thank you for such a fast response. I will definitely try that. I also have a side question, mainly to help me calm myself down. Is it likely/possible for a tooth with a crown n it, to develop a cavity? I've had pain somewhere in my mouth every day for the past 3 months, so every little issue gets me worked up now lol. honestdoc: It is possible for a crown tooth to have recurrent cavities.  Do you drink sodas, sweetened coffee, energy drinks, any sugary/acidic beverages?  Have your dentist check it.  Having sensitivity does not necessarily mean you have a cavity and vice versa.  Many times you don't feel sensitive with cavities. anthonytcollege: No, i drink almost nothing but water. I saw the dentist tuesday, and he didnt see anything, but then again he didn't notice that I had decay under one of my fillings before, until he went to do the crown prep for it. I'm concerned because that is all he said, that he didn't see anything wrong. He didn't say anything about what it could be. honestdoc: There may be a lot of factors and details in your case that I'm not aware of.  If the  tooth and filling look clear on x-rays and clinically, undetected decay under the filling is minimal and many times entombed or inactive.  Same as under a crown.  The dentist may use an explorer under the crown and if the tooth is solid, any undetectable decay is minimal.  The dentist may take multiple x-rays of different angulations to verify.  Drinking mostly water is the best.  Sugary and acidic beverages bathe around your teeth and can cause extensive decay. Busybee: All the work you've had has clearly led to an uneven bite where you are putting too much pressure on certain teeth.  You may have been grinding before and that could have led to the broken fillings.   It will be difficult to fix.  Dentists give you a hard guard in order to diagnose whether the bite is the cause.    An over the counter guard won't necessarily give you any relief as these should be custom made to your bite.  If you have this problem biting on a guard that isn't specially made could give you more pain.    You probably need some teeth adjusted down but it's complex to fix this and you should see a specialist prosthodontist.   I am not a dentist but I know all about this because I had a similar problem. honestdoc: Depending on your location, a custom guard where I'm located costs about $350 to $450.  Unfortunately most of my patients can not afford it.  I usually tell them to try an OTC guard for about $20-30 and save up for a custom one. anthonytcollege: Forgot to come back and reply. I went to a second dentist Tuesday and after an examination he determined that the temporary crowns I have on my opposite side of my face are the problem. When my dentist made them, he made them too low, so my right side is hitting first, making it sore."

This continued whenever I had something cold, and once or twice whilst smoking, though not often whilst smoking. The pains were very bad and i am embarrassed to say i was nearly in tears a couple of times.  After  a few days the pain seemed to be spreading kind of. Not the same excruciating pain localised at the root of one tooth but a more general soreness on the inner left side of my face around the original tooth which then spreads to behind my left eye and forehead. as if feeling a bit sore after being punched in the face (though I never have been punched in the face thankfully). \n\nİnitially I thought maybe there was a hole which then got infected and spread but after going dentist today he said there is no hole, and no tooth decay after taking an X ray. He said it must be sensitivity and gave me sensodyne toothpaste which I gave back to him.\n\nHe could be right but I am unconvinced. Ibuprofen helps but I don't intend to take ibuprofen forever.\n\nAny ideas or recommendations would be very welcome honestdoc: Without intraoral images and x-rays, I'm only able to guess you may be grinding/clenching and/or brushing too hard.

Busybee: The weather has no effect on your teeth and a filling will not fall out because it's wet outside but because it is not bonded properly.  A composite filling requires the correct equipment including a special light to make the filling materials bond to the tooth.    The tooth also needs to be prepared correctly for the filling to be strong.   It's also possible that the tooth needs different treatment because it may be that a filling of this type is not suitable as a restoration.   See another dentist for an opinion."

    "dialogue": "clifford slug: Hi all!\n\nHad a new filling installed yesterday due to old filling falling out. Its a back lower tooth with a deep cavity.  When the drill was used briefly I felt sensitivity. It was uncomfortable but tolerable. My question is simply whether it is normal to feel some pain when having a deep cavity filled.  The dentist waited a good five minutes at least after giving me the numbing medication.\n\nI only ask because all the internet dental sites proclaim that you should feel no pain at all during any procedure and id like to know if my experience is unusual.  Thinking about it I cant imagine that numbing agent injected into the gum could even penetrate through solid tooth to reach the nerve in the first place and its the nerve after all that feels the pain!\n\nWould love an honest answer from a dentist. \n\nThanks in anticipation! MattKW: Back lower teeth are sometimes difficult to fully numb up without adding extra anaesthetic or a different technique. It is thought that there are extra nerve fibres that enter from the transverse cervical nerve (TCN), or branches of the mylohyoid. You then have to weigh up if the pain of another injection (or 2 or 3) will be worse than just being brave for a little while. I get ready for administering an intraligamental injection for sore lower teeth that are likely to present this problem. honestdoc: Many times sensitive teeth may still feel cold if not fully anesthetized.  I would spray air & water blast on a tooth with my assistant's high suction.  If you don't feel cold, I will proceed little by little.  Years ago, I used to do full time root canals for a group practice (many inexperienced or restorative focused dentists don't like to do them).  I had the luxury of repeated practice and observed certain patterns and tendencies of anesthetizing.  A lot of my colleagues like to use a strong anesthetic called Septocaine (Articaine) 4%.  They lost the accuracy of giving the lower nerve block.  One 30 plus year dentist couldn't get a patient numb and asked me for help.  I just used the standard 2% Lidocaine and within seconds, the patient was fully numb.  With that note, I do have times when I couldn't get people numb.  I put them on oral sedatives to relax the nerves and usually succeed. MattKW: Yes, I don't see a significant better LA success with articaine, and don't stock it. Sometimes I wonder if struggling dentists have given lidocaine 1st, then when it hasn't worked, have reached for articaine. The 2nd shot works and they attribute it to articaine! For really hot pulps, I might clean out as much as they can bear, then close up with Ledermix/Odontopaste and a temp filling, then have them return later, pre-dosed with ibuprofen. honestdoc: Past American Assoc of Endodontists President and residency director Dr. Ken Hargreaves gave a lecture where his research team found 10 pain receptors in the pulp.  8 of them are Lidocaine sensitive while 2 are resistant.  The resistant ones are sensitive to Mepivicaine (3%).  On a routine LA nerve block I give the 3% slightly lower about 1 cm above the occlusal plane and followup with Lido aiming for the ear hole (Gow Gates).  Usually after the Lido, the patient is fully numb. On difficult anesthesia cases during RCTs, I get the patient numb enough to expose the pulp and inject and flood the canals with Lido and use a hand file down.  Afterwards, no more anesth worries.\nI don't drill through bone and PDLs doesn't work for me. clifford slug: Thanks for the informative answers! I'm now better informed and a little more realistic about what's possible with pain management.\n\nThanks again from Clifford Slug."

Busybee: I'm not a dentist but I reckon you need a crown and maybe a root canal. But you definitely need to see a dentist, give up the coke and muesli while this is being treated.  Stop using hydrogen peroxide.    It cannot be good for the soft tissues in your mouth.  Try to see a dentist who will do good quality work.   Maybe the dentists will disagree but that filling looks like a diy job. Dental Fear Not: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI'm not a dentist but I reckon you need a crown and maybe a root canal.

So that's filling in the 2nd pic?  If so, I paid €1100 for that back in 2012 at a posh dentist's clinic in central Berlin (the last time I was at the dentist!) - suffice to say I'll be going to a different one tomorrow, but there's no way of knowing if a dentist will do good quality work.  I suppose there's Google Reviews but I don't much trust them much either.  I also don't quite understand what's going on in the first pic, the broken outer-shell looks really worn-out & translucent when compared with the other teeth. Busybee: Perhaps the peroxide has damaged the enamel.  You cannot treat a dental infection with peroxide. MattKW: Your composite filling is failing. At a minimum you need to have it replaced. Personally, I'd aim for a pin-retained amalgam followed soon by a crown. If the damage is not too bad you will avoid a root canal therapy. But the degree of pain you're experiencing is not good, and an RCT is more likely than not.The peroxide doesn't do any harm, but it doesn't do any good either, just a waste of time. Viel Glück!

Thanks for the feedback, Matt.  I got an appointment for tomorrow morning, couldn't get one any earlier.  At least the pain, while constant, is dulled with Ibuprofen, and those sharp attacks are only intermittent.  I wonder if taking the bad tooth out, root-canal treatment and whatnot might ease the constant head-pressure (like permanently wearing a motorcycle helmet) i've had for many years?  It sure feels like the tooth should be pulled out.  If it eases this head-pressure it will be a priceless effect, tho' i've got a feeling it may be caused not by one bad tooth, but by my constant teeth-grinding...i even do it during the day without noticing.  I'll probably be prescribed one of those plastic teeth-gums, already tried them 6 years ago and they just felt horrible in the mouth...but maybe i should've stuck with it.\n\nA question on the peroxide, if i may: i understood it that when it foams it means an infection is present and it's killing it.  In the past a second peroxide-wash would for example only produce minimal foam, so i knew the first wash had effectively solved the problem, and felt it so as any pain would slowly ebb away.  This time however there's always foam and the last couple of times last night it even produced more pain.  I'd just like to better understand what's going on there. Busybee: There was an EU directive in 2012 (2011/84/EU) which restricted the EU use of hydrogen peroxide in consumer dental products to 0.1% as the safety threshold.  0.1 to 0.6% is deemed as safe when supervised by a dental practitioner.  Concentrations over this amount have been scientifically determined to be a risk to oral health.   I'd suggest you do some research on the studies underpinning this legislation before continuing to self medicate in this way.

If that directive is from 2011 I wonder why they haven't restricted sales. Busybee: These days its sale is restricted in the UK.

    "dialogue": "Slobo: Dear,\n\nI was reading about hardness of teeth. Some pages say that enamel is the hardest part of our body, even harder than steel (although more brittle). That is why we can not damage our teeth if we scrape them by nails, neither we damage them by cutlery.\n\nOn the other hand, brushing hard can damage teeth. But, toothbrush is softer than nails or cutlery. I am now wondering about the following.\n\nWhy brushing hard can damage teeth while scarping them with nails does not damage?\n\nThank you.\n\nBest regards, honestdoc: Scraping teeth with your nail may not abrade enamel short term.  Long term, your gums are readily traumatized and can permanently recede exposing more softer root cementum which can abrade. \n\nToothpaste has a lot of abrasive substances especially in whitening labels and can cause damage.  Most of the traumatic damage occurs similarly with receding gums exposing more root. Slobo: Thanks for the reply. I see what you mean. When gums recede, they would expose dentin, right? Are you saying that dentin can be (easily) abraded by nails?\n\nI saw many comments saying that one should not try to remove plaque by nails. What I experience from time to time is that plaque gets hard enough so that it is like impossible to remove it by a toothbrush. However, reasonably gentle scrape gets them off. Isn't that better to get rid of them, rather to let them stay? This can occur to me only 10 days after seeing a dentist. I floss daily. honestdoc: When gums recede, cementum (root surface) is exposed.  Cementum is softer than dentin.  You are right in 2 counts.  The leftover plaque can calcify (tartar build up) due to the mineral content in your saliva and cannot be removed other than a dental instrument (perhaps your fingernail).  Plaque can mineralize after 48 hrs and is best to remove as much of it as possible. Try an electric toothbrush like Sonicare or Oral B which can remove plaque more effectively than manual toothbrush. \n\nI not able to predict the trauma/damage you can inflict with your nails.  You are also right that it is best to get rid of tartar buildup rather to let them stay.  If you have healthy gums, once or twice yearly cleaning should be enough.  If you have gum disease, you may need deep cleanings (Scaling/Root Planing) and more frequent periodontal treatments.  If you live in the US, dental visits can be very expensive without dental insurance.  Hopefully you have regular access to them. Slobo: Thanks for the advice and for the comments."

After the check up the female dentist told me that there was nothing wrong with my teeth and the lump was just the bone that was left after the extraction and the gums were swollen because of food touching the empty space of gums where i had the extraction and she said it will be fine. But she told me to come back the next day to make a crown for another tooth which was damaged.\n\nI came in the next day, and this time i had a male doctor. I asked him to check my teeth and gums again and there was something wrong, i had to do 3 fillings on the right side which is not where my gums were swollen (and it's just weird that i still have cavity even though i brush and floss my teeth very carefully and use mouthwash, i don't drink alcohol, soda and i don't smoke). When i asked him about the swollen gums and the lump around that area, he told me the same thing the female dentist did, that it was a bone that was left after the extraction. He said come back 2 weeks later to finish the crown and he'd get the bone out.\n\nThe appointment is today so i went there. After finishing the crown. He took a look at the swollen gums area on the left side, and he took x-ray, but he said that he doesn't know why they're swollen and cause pain. I asked him what about the hard slump and he just said it was something different. He gave me Amoxicillin for a week and told me to come back if i still feel pain and the swollen gums don't go away.\n\nShould i find another dentist? Isn't the dentist supposed to know what's wrong with my mouth and how to fix it? How come a dentist says there's nothing wrong during the regular check-up but when i ask another dentist to do the check-up in the same office, he says otherwise. I have health anxiety and now i'm just nervous that i may have oral cancer. lovelyrose: I would recommend that you see another dentist for the second medical opinion mandymoore: Dentistry is not the profession people think it is. Dentistry in general deals with filling cavities and not with prevention of tooth problems. If you ask any dentist why a problem is happening, they usually can't answer it. You get vague answers like more research needs to be done or maybe it's your genetical make up. Dentistry doesn't give solutions on how to prevent problems. A second opinion may sound good but it's highly likely the new dentist may know as little as your first one. Personally, I doubt you have oral cancer but if you're concerned I would see a doctor. You may want to try oil pulling to see if that helps with your gums. You can just google it. You can also read Weston A. Price's info on healthy teeth. Personally, I think the dentist office you went to may have made a mistake. Why else would you have a lump?  If you go to a new dentist, when they ask you what your concern is, do not tell them anything. Just let them figure it out and tell you. A dentist's training focuses on treating a problem like a cavity, not on knowing or understanding the causes of dental problems. If that were the case, dentists would know the answers. If the truth to preventing cavities and teeth problems really was in brushing your teeth and flossing, dentists would be out of work. Obviously, even if it helps a little it's not the solution to the problem, as many people who have tooth problems and brush and floss daily will tell you. honestdoc: Images of both introral and x-rays would be very helpful.  It is hard for you when you see different dentists of varying experiences and skill sets and hear different things.  Hopefully you will find a dentist you feel comfortable with.\n\n\n\nmandymoore said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDentistry is not the profession people think it is.

Obviously, even if it helps a little it's not the solution to the problem, as many people who have tooth problems and brush and floss daily will tell you. To mandymoore,  it is not fair to generalize dentists when you or your friends may have less than stellar experience with one.  Similarly if I were to negatively generalize your line of work.  In the US, Canada, and my forum dentist friend in Australia, we have to complete rigorous academic and clinic training that has more requirements than our medical school counterpart.  We are in the same classes as the medical students in addition to our core classes.  The medical instructors all know dental students have it harder than medical.  After medical school, the residents will face their most intense medical training while we are prepared to practice dentistry.  About 95% of medical doctors do not know most dental conditions.\n\nWhen patients say they brush and floss, almost all with cavities don't do it properly or enough.  They may brush when they feel like it (once a month) and floss once before their yearly visit if at all. They blame us because they \"brush and floss\" and still get dental problems.   \n\nYes, patients do not tell us the whole story.  The other day, I had a patient with a bad tooth pain.  Looking at the very subtle patterns on the x-ray, I asked if she traumatized the tooth recently.  After verifying, she immediately knows I know what I'm looking for.  Another case where there is a strange mouth lesion.  Patient denied every inquiry as to how and why.  I asked her if she uses cinnamon products and she smiled and confirmed. \n\nWe don't know all the answers similar to medical doctors don't know all the answers.  If there are no cavities (along with no traumas, no crooked/missing teeth, no oral disease/dysfunction, etc.), there will be no dentists.  A pompous medical doctor once told me that.  Sure we dentists could all go on permanent vacation and not treat people like him. Rosa: Jack, if you haven't yet found a firmer diagnosis, perhaps you could see an oral surgeon?  I know it sounds too strong but it doesn't mean you need surgery and you might get a more accurate diagnosis?  Going to another dentist might bring same results.  Some professionals just go by the book instead of using their ingenuity.   \n\nIf you live in NYC please go to the NYU College of Dentistry, or if in another city go to the equivalent there.\n\nI too have a problem but with a prosthodontist and hesitate to see another one for the same reason I gave you.  However, I don't have the alternatives I suggested to you and I'll have to find another one soon.   \n\nI sincerely wish you good luck!"

    "dialogue": "Rosa: It's a little long, please bear with me......\n\nI have a 7 year old denture set, excellently made and kept but my gums shrank so decided to reline them.  I found a prosthodontist and from day one I haven't been able to eat without serious pain in my gums even with soft food!  I complain and he tries, but nothing helps.  I paid him in full upfront and got tired of going to him many times without results.  I asked him for a refund.  He didn't answer and continues trying...without results.  He did them over and now the palate feels bulky and heavy, my front teeth show longer and when I talk or laugh I have to stop in the middle to avoid denture lowering!!!  This denture feels painful and uncomfortable! \n\nBefore this relining, I could at least eat without pain in the gums.  When I first went to him I said I wanted to start only by replacing 2 attachments then take it up from there, but he insisted to do it all at one time and he did...at the expense of my mouth health, my nutrition, my time, and my pocket!  I feel he's young and inexperienced and not too neat.  Makes many mistakes and thank God, he catches himself but it results in sore mouth from too many quick trying the dentures in and out... \n\nMy wonderful dentist who did my great denture 7 years ago, retired and went back to NYU College of Dentistry to teach.  I went there to see him but the College doesn't fix work done outside.  But he managed to examine me, as the student supervisor, with x-rays and the collaboration of faculty prosthodontist and periodontist, and he said all I needed was to replace the 2 attachments.\n\nI know I need a new prosthodontist to see whether this mess can be fixed, or if as a result, I need new ones at exorbitant price...BUT, I'm very afraid to have to go through something similar.  I'm devastated and will be most grateful for your opinion! MattKW: Any photos of your mouth, and of the inner surface of your denture? Any X-rays? You mention you have attachments, so I assume these are implant-supported dentures?\nJust to clarify, there is common confusion about the following areas of dentistry:\n\nProsthodontist - a general dentist who has undergone further training to become a specialist and often deals with complex problems involving crowns, bridges, implants,... Doesn't make dentures themselves but subcontracts out to a dental laboratory technician.\nDentist - a general dentist. Doesn't make dentures themselves but subcontracts out to a dental laboratory technician.\nProsthetist - a lab technician who is allowed to make dentures directly with the public. They are not allowed to do any alterations to natural teeth.\nLab technician - makes dentures, crowns, bridges... for general dentists and prosthodontists to give to their patients..\nI think you might be talking about dealing with a prosthetist. If they're not used to attachment dentures, then it could be difficult. You might have to go to another general dentist, or shift up a level to a prosthodontist. Rosa: Hello and thank you MattKW, I should've explained more but was afraid to make my post  longer.\n\nI have by now 2-month old x-rays of my own teeth (only 8 front lower which my great dentist (who also made my dentures) kept alive by only one entire crown at the same time).  I'm not familiar with \"photos of your mouth, and of the inner surface of your denture\", are these for implants?  \n\nI meant the 2 male attachments at each end of my lower partial which clip into my lower teeth receivers.  No implants as my gums were (are) too thin and shrinking rapidly.\n\nAlso thank you for the well clarified list of the different areas of dentistry!\n\nMy dentist wasn't a prosthodontist as far as I knew, but made my great dentures 7 (probably 8 years ago by now) but unfortunately for me, retired to teach at NYU.  I must remember the next one must be a little younger to start with...  \n\nMy present professional who's causing me all this aggravation, is a prosthodontist according to his diplomas on the wall, and whom I chose because I learned prosthodontists make, or at least prepare to make, dentures.  He has his own lab in his office in care of his partner (who I don't know whether he's a prosthetist to do lab work).\n\nNow that I have the dental professionals well defined thanks to you, I wonder whether I wouldn't be better off with a prosthetist?  I don't know what to do but I stopped going to my prosthodontist and I'm afraid to have anyone now touch my dentures...Oh God what to do...   \n\nThanks so much again!  \n\nP.S.  Are you a prosthodontist or a prosthetist and in NYC by chance?  What shall I do???"

    "dialogue": "ChillWill: Hi everyone. I'm at the dentists in a few days but just wanted to see what some of you think about my situation.\n\nAbout 18 months ago I had an abscess on the gum of a middle upper-right tooth.\n\nWhen I had this abscess I was extremely fatigued, had serious brainfog and could barely get out of bed or function properly probably from the infection leaking into my blood stream.\n\nI had the tooth pulled and within 24 hours it felt like a weight had been lifted and I was back to my normal self.\n\nNot long after having the tooth pulled I started getting problems with the tooth on the opposite side (upper middle left.)\n\nThe tooth had pitting so my old dentist cut the pitting out and filled the tooth.\n\nThat tooth has never felt right even after being filled in.\n\nNow I find myself in the same situation as when I started.\n\nI again have serious brain fog, fatigue and I keep getting headaches on the side where the problem tooth is.\n\nThe headaches are more confined to the left side of my head and the brain fog is all over.\n\nSometimes I can barely notice things right in front of me. Like this morning I was looking for my mobile and it was literally right in front of me.\n\nSometimes when I exercise it feels like the tooth is pulsating a little bit and I get a headache only on the left side of my head above the tooth.\n\nI also get a bit of a nose bleed after these headaches but only out of the left nostril on the side of the bad tooth so I'm wondering if the infection could spread to the sinuses?\n\nThe tooth doesn't hurt but I'm always aware of it if that makes sense.\n\nAnd there doesn't seem to be any sign of an abscess that I can see and no pain when I touch the tooth but I didn't have any pain or sensitivity on the old tooth I had taken out that 100% did have an abscess.\n\nI've attached a pic. Do you think this tooth could be infected and the cause of my issues.\n\nI went to a doctor at the beginning of this year and he checked my blood and said I was fine but I'm really not.\n\nRight now I don't know how much longer I can put up feeling like this.\n\nAnyway I appreciate you reading. Thanks! honestdoc: Unfortunately we can't diagnose the problem from the image.  From your description, you may have a sinus problem especially if the discomfort is more pronounced when you exercise, bend forward or go up & downstairs.  Have your physician check your sinuses if you continue to experience these symtopms.\n\nYou dentist can check if the bite is off, the filling is intact or well sealed, the pulp (nerve) is vital, or any problems relating to the area. ChillWill: Thanks Doc, I'll see what the dentist says on Monday. Hopefully he can do an xray and see what's going on. ChillWill: Here's another pic I just took. Is that an abscess circled in green. It's strange because it doesn't seem to be above the problem tooth circled in blue. ChillWill: Ok. So I was just at the dentists and he took an X-Ray. He said he doesn't think the tooth is infected but there's a large white mark hanging down over the tooth that appears to be my sinus.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nDo you think that's definitely my sinus all swollen or an infection? ChillWill: I'm going to book an appointment with the Docs to get my sinuses checked out. Kim Osborne: ChillWill said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI'm going to book an appointment with the Docs to get my sinuses checked out. Looks like the tooth needs an RCT. There is a dark circle around the root of that tooth which shows an infection. Blow up the picture and you can see it. ChillWill: Hi Kim. I'm not sure what exactly you are seeing. Would it be possible for you to circle it to show the infection please?\n\nThanks for taking a look by the way!"

Is this a filling that is only temporary or??? The dentist did not tell me that I needed to come back or anything to get it replaced etc.. but they might have forgot?? Idk is there any way to tell if it was or was not a medicated filling? MattKW: Sometimes it might be a sedative lining like Ledermix cement. Even a Kalsogen/Kalzinol could be said to be medicated.

Since then it has been sensitive. I've had part of it replaced now (couple of months since being done) and it's still the same.\n\nIt's likely that the dentist will need to do more work on it (but I'll give it a bit more time). I'm worried that if the dentist does the same thing again then I'll still have the same problem. Is there a point where I should look for a new dentist?\n\nI like my dentist but some people are questioning whether he's very good. Is this quite a common thing or is the dentist doing something wrong, and should I consider a different dentist? btw the dentist isn't charging for re-work, so they aren't doing it for the money. honestdoc: Any prep work (drilling) can cause sensitivity especially to cold.  Many times if the filling is small, the sensitivity should decrease.  If the filling or cavity is near the nerve (pulp), there is a chance the pulp can get irreversibly damaged (intense pain that wakes you up) or die (swelling, infection).  The dentist should communicate with you on realistic expectations.  Many times after the filling, the bite may have changed because checking the bite after anesthesia may not be as accurate.  Make sure your teeth are biting ok."

    "title": "Decay under a crown",
    "dialogue": "DavidN: Hello, I wonder if some knowledgeable persons will give their views on this particular conundrum. I am 66 and recently attended my check up. Following an X-ray my dentist says that there is decay under the crown on my back upper right. The solution is to refer me to a suitably qualified specialist (She also mentioned that that tooth can be tricky as it's close to sinuses etc.) who will undertake root canal treatment et al. But she said that it wasn't definite that the decay would cause a problem immediately, although eventually the tooth would break at some point in the future. As the tooth is not causing any problems currently, she says that sometimes the body isolates the problem and doesn't cause trouble. I am going back in a week and have been asked whether I want treatment or not. To be honest I'm a little perplexed. This is first time (in about 55 years of visits) that I have been asked as to whether I want it doing or leaving. It is also the first time I have been referred to someone else for this type of treatment. This is not a great thing to say - but would my age have any bearing on her comments? In short, I haven't a clue what to do. This is the first time I have seen this particular (private) dentist.  Any help or explanation would be very welcome. Thanks, David. honestdoc: Please provide x-ray(s) and intraoral image if available.  I'm more conservative than the average for profit dentist.  If the decay is accessible, I'll clean it below the crown and repair it.  It would be a marginal judgement call to replace the crown.  If the tooth is vital, no root canal is needed.  How you know is if it feels cold (cold test) and no swelling. DavidN: Hi, Thank you for taking the time to reply. I'm afraid that I don't have the x- rays. It not something that I would think to ask for or, indeed, understand. As far as I am aware this particular tooth is completely inert and forgettable.Just normal, so to speak, without any swelling or sensitivity. To be honest, I felt communication was a little \"unclear\" during the appointment and l left with a lack of understanding and therefore confidence. A second opinion may seem the clever thing to do - other than the  money already paid for exam, x-rays and cleaning. honestdoc: All x-rays now are digital.  Non-digital x-rays have been phased out with no technical support and no parts for maintenance and repairs.  You can request a digital x-ray emailed to you.\n\nIt is hard to find an honest dentist because of the cost of operation and most young dentist have outrageous student loans in the US.   If you live in an expensive location like California, NY, East coast, Pacific NW, it is even more difficult.  Chances are, you need minimal work on that tooth. MattKW: DavidN said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHello, I wonder if some knowledgeable persons will give their views on this particular conundrum. ... Thanks, David. If there's decay under the crown,the crown may have to be removed before you can tell if the tooth is salvageable.\nthere's no point going to an endodontist if you don't determine the amount of decay. It might be a tooth that's OK to do endo, but if you can't rebuild the tooth with a new crown, then there's no point starting an RCT.\nIf it's a 2nd molar, sometimes it's debatable whether it is a good idea to save these type of teeth. Not only do you have to do an RCT and a new crown, but you have to see if you will be able to keep it clean, and not endanger adjacent teeth. As honestdoc says, an Xray would be very helpful. Busybee: You should get a second opinion.  I had some awful decay because of a gap that developed in a seal of an onlay but you could not see the decay on any x ray because the crown material was too dense.  When it was removed it literally just fell off even though I had hardly any symptoms.   A lot of dentists prefer to leave something like that until it causes a problem because once you touch it, it can be difficult to fix and can start symptoms off.   So quite often they will monitor it for a long time before doing anything. DavidN: Well, I'm due back to see this particular dentist next week for just a 20 minute appointment - really to finish off the initial exam, polish and discuss the way forward. I intend to ask quite a few \"probing\" questions and you have really helped to gather my thoughts and to clarify things. Thank you for your replies and help. Cheers, David. MattKW: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\t...   A lot of dentists prefer to leave something like that until it causes a problem because once you touch it, it can be difficult to fix and can start symptoms off.   So quite often they will monitor it for a long time before doing anything. I don't know how you surmise that dentists will, \"leave something like until it causes a problem\". I hope that would be very rare - it certainly would raiselagal and ethical questions. So, we tell patients there's a problem, give them the options with pros and cons, and guide them to a reasonable solution. If they don't take my advice, then I record their choice so they can't come back and blame me. The only time I'd advise them to \"leave something\" until it causes problem\" is if:\n\nthe eventual problem will be minor, AND\nthe problem will not endanger other teeth or bone.\nAn example might be a lone-standing tooth with an RCT that is failing, but the either the patient cannot afford a crown, or a crown offers no benefit. \nSo, as I said in earlier post to DavidN, the decay has to be sorted out first, and if this means removing the crown (usually) then so be it. If the tooth is still salvageable, then the decay is removed and a temporary crown is cemented in place.The endodontist will not be happy if the decay and salvageability of the tooth has not been sorted out before his consultation. Busybee: It's not rare in the UK MattKW.   These days there is a policy of watchful waiting if a tooth doesn't have symptoms or obvious root failure.  It's a big shift from how they used to work, but I guess dentists are worried about litigation these days.  So even if there is sensitivity and some pain there are many dentists who will not want to open up the tooth if there is a big filling or potential of complications.   Or they refer on. MattKW: I don't doubt that some dentists do it that way. I take issue with the statement that \"there is a policy\", and that there are \"many dentists\" that do this. Unless you have hard stats, then that would appear to be a very personal and anecdotal observation that misleads people and casts a slur on most dentists. With regard to avoiding poss litigation, I consider that to be a furphy, again with no evidence. It should be the opposite, as a dentist leaves themselves open to litigation if they do not take the steps as I suggest in previous post, including possible referral. Busybee: What evidence can I give you Matt?  I'm not going to dig up scientific studies on the subject.  Minimally invasive and preventative dentistry is becoming the norm in the UK.  This is a seismic shift from the 1970s NHS dentistry where even the hint of a cavity was filled.  The absence of pain was irrelevant.    It's not a slur to focus on prevention and a conservative management approach to old restorations.  It's an opinion that litigation plays a part in a cautious approach.  We have a compensation culture.   This is just the way things are. MattKW: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWhat evidence can I give you Matt?  I'm not going to dig up scientific studies on the subject.

It's an opinion that litigation plays a part in a cautious approach.  We have a compensation culture.   This is just the way things are. No, perhaps you misunderstand why and how these changes are occurring.\nWhen I was a student, it was certainly \"if in doubt, drill it out\" as in the 70s.\nThe presence of early decay can now be treated with fluoride applications, toothpaste, mouthwashes etc, and monitored over time with a well informed patient so unnecessary intervention can be avoided.\nThat is not to say it is left alone, \"...if a tooth doesn't have symptoms or obvious root failure...\", we simply don't need to be as aggressive as we once were. I don't drill anywhere as much as following the principles that I was taught, and I have seen the benefits.\nI know what they teach nowadays and why, I have seen the lecture notes, the scientific literature, the clinical changes over my 36 years, and have young dentists working with me.\nIt is all about the better understanding and science of decay, and has absolutely nothing to do with litigation/compensation. It is all about handling the patient and the disease process more appropriately. Busybee: Matt what I am referring to is being termed by the profession as \"defensive dentistry\".   There's been quite a bit of discussion and research into the subject in the UK.\n\nI am glad that you agree with my other points ref the changes in approach from invasive to conservative. DavidN: Matt ,\nYou mentioned:- \"advise them to leave the decay if the problem will not endanger other teeth or bone\". This is a worry of mine (I have a brother who ignored a problem with his back, bottom right molar and ended up have a operation where his jaw needed to be cut away due abscess and infection....). Surely it impossible to tell how something like this will play out and therefore it's better to address the issue directly rather than wait and monitor. Who knows what may lurk under the crown and where it might lead. Thanks for your help, David. MattKW: It has to be monitored, i.e. regular checks and X-rays. You don’t simply leave anything until the patient feels a problem. It is the dentist’s responsibility to advise the patient of this requirement, and I record the warning. But not all patients heed advice, as did your brother. DavidN: O.K I understand thanks. I can't grumble really. I had my first amalgam fillings back in the 1960's and, give or take the odd implosion, they are still being worked on and giving service nearly 60 years later. Onward and upward!"

Also taken with meal\n\n- difficult breathing sometimes\n\n- She is constantly saying she is in pain, lower throat area, and sometimes walking fast or talking loud hurts her\n\nDentist is off today, and we went to the doctor yesterday (but he didn't do much for us, only took a swap for sample, and say to get back to us 3 days)\n\nmy question is:\n\nCan she skip the last 5 pills.

Ok, these things happen.\n\nHowever, the dentist now says I need another 2, but before she can crown the teeth, she needs to do a filling.\n\nNow, for me a crown negates the need for a filling.  Can someone please advise if this is correct or am I being scammed?  If I’m not being scammed, a slight explanation would be great if possible.\n\nThanks folks MattKW: The filling is part of the foundation ( or \"core\") supporting the crown, plus any natural tooth remaining.\n\nSometimes the old filling might have a questionable area underneath it visible on the X-ray, possibly indicating decay. So you have to take out the filling to make sure. I don't put crowns on top of someone else's dodgy work, because I'll be blamed if things go wrong.\n\nWhen drilling for a crown, it sometimes happens that this removes the \"grip\" of the filling and it falls out. Sometimes that's no big deal, and it doesn't need replacement at the time. Sometimes I swear under my breath and have to do a filling on the spot. The dentist needs to try and assess the likelihood and consequences of that before doing the crown preparation. \n\nIf it's one of my fillings, then I have a good idea of what went in, but there have been a number of times I will remove the old filling first. alan860: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe filling is part of the foundation ( or \"core\") supporting the crown, plus any natural tooth remaining.\n\nSometimes the old filling might have a questionable area underneath it visible on the X-ray, possibly indicating decay.

Not something that was quoted separately.\n\nYes, I’d rather make sure the foundation was sound before applying a 1000 dollar piece of ceramic over something that was going to be exposed to high forces.  It was just the way the dentist explained it, they said fill it now then back next week for a crown.  I know they also quote separately for root canal work if required, but again if I’m putting a high value item there, I’d want to make sure the thing wasn’t going to be disturbed again, so for me root canal would be a part of the prep too.  \n\nNormally I would never question something like this, but there was a few things happened during that consultation that looked a bit suspect so figured it best to ask rather than for ever suspect.\n\nAlan MattKW: Most of the crowns I do are for patients I've been seeing for many years, so I know what's going on and replacement before the preparation is often unnecessary. Even so, sometimes I have patched the teeth a number of times, and it really needs to be rebuilt in one piece."

    "dialogue": "Kr222: hello everyone, I have what is probably a pretty stupid question but I’m desperate and in pain. In the x ray attached does anyone know why the tooth has a big white spot on it? I thought originally that it could be due to the angle at which the X-ray was taken, but I’ve had multiple X-rays and every single one comes out with this white spot on it. Dentist never mentioned it and it seems like it’s a non issue but the tooth has been aching on and off for close to a year now and no one seems to have any clue why. Has anyone had a similar X-ray? Thanks honestdoc: I'm not sure if we are looking at the same tooth, but I'm seeing 2 white spots on the LR canine.  It could be natural anatomy where the location has denser mineral content or possible bonding fillings or for orthodontics.  Make sure it is as smooth as possible to avoid trapping plaque, debris, etc.  \n\nI can't explain your pain from the x-ray.  I can't see the root tip health of the canine.  If you dentist didn't see any dental problems on that area,  I'm suspecting you may be grinding/clenching due to stress.  Many times you don't realize you are doing that. Kr222: Thank you so much for responding. I’ve had more than 1 X-ray of the area due to this mystery pain and every time the root is obscured by this white area. So I guess I’m wondering if maybe there is something there that is not visible because of this, or if its just simply a result of the angle at which the X-ray was taken. Just pulling at straws, since it’s really driving me crazy. The grinding suggestion is definitely a consideration. The only reason why I didn’t suspect that originally is because this tooth is out of occlusion and does not make contact with any upper teeth that I know of. Unless it is something I do in my sleep, of which I am not aware. honestdoc: If you are talking about the white area covering the LR canine root, with the angle it is hard to see but I think it may be lingual tori.  When a tooth is out of occlusion, that tooth will continue to erupt until it is opposed.  Sometimes during unopposed eruption the tooth may feel some discomfort.  The other teeth in occlusion during grinding and clenching can present some discomfort as well.  Try an Over-the-Counter bite guard and if you notice some improvement, have your dentist fabricate a custom guard."

I currently have a temporary set of dentures.    \n\nAs I am sure you are aware I have to have temporary dentures while I wait for my gums to heal.  Once my gums fully heal I will get my final set of dentures.\n\nOn average how long does it take for the gums to fully heal enough to get my final dentures? honestdoc: Individual healing times will vary but plan on ~4-6 months.  After 6 months, fabricating final dentures will be more predictable.  In addition to your gums, the bone needs to heal and stabilize.  Occasionally you may experience bone chips (dead particles of bone shedding out).\n\nIn the mean time, have your dental provider adjust sore spots and periodically apply soft liner material to accommodate the \"looseness\" as bone flattens.  Unfortunately the lower dentures will not fit as well as the upper and will require hard acrylic relines more often.  This is due to the lower bone flattening at a faster rate. ennogs: Thank you for your reply.\n\nI am thinking of getting the all on four implants. Would you say I am best waiting at least 6 months after my extractions before getting the all on four implants? honestdoc: Many times the surgeon will place bone graft immediately after extractions to minimize bone flattening.  You can request a consultation visit to go over implant and bone grafting options. ennogs: Thank you."

I had the filling ground down a few days after it was initially placed and dentist said it was fine thereafter when he checked with the bite paper stuff. Does not feel like I am biting weird or anything. Hopefully not something awful like a leaky filling or abscess Busybee: Could be that your bite has changed because of the amount of work and your teeth have realigned putting extra pressure on that one.  Composite can sometimes wear down, but 2 months is a bit soon.    You should go back to the dentist to see if it can be adjusted a bit more.      Some dentists are better at adjusting bite than others.   It's best to avoid having lots of fillings done at once."

Do you think it is dry socket or just normal? The pain eases with meds as long as i alternate between paracetemol and ibuprifen every couple of hours. Thanks honestdoc: The pain easing when taking OTC pain meds is a good sign.  How you know it is urgent is intense pain and or swelling.  Getting lower molar teeth extracted is very traumatic.  The tooth has 2 main roots in the thick jaw bone.  Most likely the dentist had to cut bone, soft tissue and or separate the tooth to access the tooth and root fragments. Unfortunately with a more traumatic extraction, it does take longer to heal.  If you have a dry socket, most likely none of the remedies or medications would relieve it.  \n\nYour options are to continue to allow it to heal, seek another dentist for possible dry socket (I don't think you have it) or to wait for your dentist to be available for followup and continue to do the usual to relieve it.  Make sure you eat before you take ibuprofen because it damages the stomach lining. sekagirl: seek out another dental healthcare provider!!!

    "dialogue": "scobog: I have recently been having some serious problems with my teeth. I was given the all clear 2 years ago with 1 or two fillings saying my teeth were in perfect Health. 6 Months later i was told I needed 7-9 fillings in my teeth (all over no specific area, mainly molars) & the dentists couldn't explain why. I used to drink a huge amount of sugary drinks but had cut back a year or so prior to this news only having 1 a day, so it was a shock. I got the work done with all white fillings and thought that would be me sorted.\n\nUnfortunately following this I was experiencing some pain in my upper left hand side of the mouth with sensitivity and dull pain that made me want to bite down/prod at it. Following this sensitivity was found in the second molar so root canal treatment was carried out. A short while down the line the next tooth my 2nd BiCuspid ( I had 1st molars removed when I was very young) became sore and root canal surgery was also performed. Now further down the line the next tooth (1st Bicuspid) has become extremely sensitive, much worse than any of the others had & root canal is currently recommended for it. I can't eat anything hot or cold on it but there is no other pain than sensitivity.\n\nNow the strange part is that the sensitivity seems to be moving along my teeth one by one however the pain that makes me want to prod and bite down still exists between my 2nd molar and my 1st bicsupid in the gum. I'm not sure what else I can do other than get the 3rd root canal on the 1st Bicuspid which I really do not want to do, as I don't feel that approach is solving any problems.\n\nA little bit of other background is that I had a deviated septum from sport fixed through a septoplasty 8 months ago due to sinus blockage problems. This has since cleared up and am on a prescribed steroid spray to keep my sinus's under control. The sinus problems were originally thought to be the problem of the problems in the top left however they have since been quite good and the problems still exist. \nI also have all of my wisdom teeth in/growing & have been since the problems started. I've seen two dentists & neither had concerns with the space in my mouth with regards to them due to having my 2nd molars removed when younger.\n\nApologies for the long post but I am at the end of my tether with it as I have spent a serious amount of cash on my teeth & no one ever seems to have answers other than root canal. My dentist is very patient and has been extremely reluctant to do this 3rd root canal but there doesn't seem to be another choice as I've had several X-rays and nothing is showing up. honestdoc: Sorry for your predicament.  Unfortunately your teeth do get sensitive especially to cold temperatures after fillings.  Sinus pain can mimic teeth pain and how you know is if you bend forward or go up & downstairs with the pain more pronounced.  If it is sinus pain, have your physician evaluate and treat it. scobog: Thanks for the reply however the tooth that is now sensitive, does not have a filling/root canal in it as of yet. The sensitivity seems to be moving from tooth to tooth as the one behind receives root canal treatment. I have been to a Ear Nose & throat doctor due to my sinus surgery and they are happy with the health of my Sinus's."

Please help! honestdoc: There may be a few of possibilities.  The most likely is you may be clenching and/or grinding your teeth.  Have you been experiencing unresolved stress, deadlines, change of routine, etc.?  You may not be aware that you are doing it.  According to experts, your teeth only touch 20 minutes a day including all meals and function.  The rest of the time, your teeth are ~1 cm or 1/4 inch apart.  When you clench, you stress your teeth and jaws and may experience unexplained pain.  If you think this may be a source of pain, try Over-the-Counter bite guard and if pain is improved, try custom bite guard fabricated by your dentist.\n\nDid you ever have trauma to your jaws such as sports injury, physical injury, braces (orthodontics) in the past?  Did your dentist not think the wisdom teeth may be a source for pain?  You may have TMJ pain and may benefit from evaluation.\n\nIt is more rare but if the pain is coming from Lower Left side and you have heart conditions, you may be experiencing referred chest pains.\n\nEven more rare is the possibility of neurologic conditions.

I don't think she has many untouched teeth left in her mouth at this point.  \n\nRight now she once again has several teeth hurting her, and while we're hopeful these might just require fillings, the thought of one of them needing another root canal is weighing heavily on our minds.  It's a painful procedure for her (she also has fibromyalgia and has a low tolerance for pain).  \n\nWe're considering some other options in the event she is told she needs another root canal treatment, such as dentures or implants.  She really doesn't want dentures, but that is a lot more doable for us financially.  Implants are a much more attractive option, but while we could afford to do one implant or maybe a few at a time, doing a large number of implants at once is probably out of our reach financially.  Note that we've kept up on her teeth, treating them either with fillings or root canals (full restore with mounted crown in all cases) as they need them, so it isn't like she would need a whole bunch of teeth done at once.  But, the problem with doing implants one by one is the pain involved - she would prefer to just have one big procedure instead of a bunch of smaller ones.\n\nWhat my wife wants at this point is just to be done with the whole thing.  She's reached a level of frustration with her teeth where she wants to pull all of them out and get them all replaced, either with dentures, or, ideally, with implants.  And this at last brings me to my question:\n\nDo dentists ever proactively extract and replace teeth based on a patient having a chronic history of tooth issues, with the idea being to just kind of get it over with, and eliminate the potential of future issues?  I'll admit I have a lot of reservations about the thought of pulling teeth which are either healthy, or which have had a full root canal with crown restoration.  But the problem is, based on her history, we can reasonably expect her to continue to need a root canal probably every few years, if not more often.  In this scenario, would it be recommended to just pull all the teeth out and be done with it?  \n\nNote that there is a genetic history of horrible teeth in my wife's family.  Her grandmother and mother both ended up having a lot of teeth replaced (her mom actually has full snap in replacements with posts mounted into the jaw bone).  We think this explains the high level of decay she suffers from, but any suggestions on how to help prevent that are also welcomed.  \n\nI'm sorry for the very long-winded post.  This is many years of our life I'm kind of pouring out here, and I really do appreciate any advice or suggestions.  Thank you so much.\n\n- Matt MattKW: Unfortunately it sometimes comes to this. Financially and emotionally it can become a burden for the patient. Even so, I would advise about taking out all teeth. There are usually a few strategic teeth that can and should be saved, e.g. canines , at least a molar in each corner of the mouth, and lower front teeth. This will allow her to have partial dentures that are manageable during the transition. If necessary, the remain9ng teeth might be removed in later life, but it'll be easier to cope with the changes after this introduction. People who have had lots of decay need careful assessment for implants - the implants require more care than normal teeth because they are more liable for gum infections and failure if hygiene and diet is poor. So don't assume she will automatically stick in implants and everything will be hunky-dory.\nGo have a good heart-to-heart with a few dentists for differeing opinions. MatthewD23: Thanks, MattKW.  I had seen your replies on other threads before posting, and was hoping you might answer mine.  This is exactly the sort of advice I came here seeking, and has given me and my wife a lot to consider.  Thank you. honestdoc: When teeth are extracted, the jaw bone flattens continuously.  It becomes more and more difficult to restore function due to decreased retention for dentures, available bone for implants and bone strength for bridge abutments. This is more pronounced in the lower jaw where dentures and partials become so ill-fitting that people refuse to wear them after it is fabricated.\n\nWhen I hear people say they want all there teeth pulled just to be done with it, I see red flags with unrealistic expectations.  Like Dr. MattKW mentioned, implants require more care and maintenance than natural teeth.  People do not consider costs, trauma, lack of function (dentures & partial dentures), and high need for maintenance until after the fact.  Just like cars, people's mouths will never be maintenance free.\n\nI would suggest finding a dentist you trust and have a thorough session to discuss health history (heart conditions, diabetes, and any medications that causes dry mouth, excess bleeding, and/or bisphosphonates which will cause bone damage), parafunctions such as grinding/clenching, diet and full treatment plan.  If saving teeth is realistic, then there should be full expectations on maintenance not just \"I brush and sometimes floss.\"  Many factors contribute to bad teeth and those need to be identified. MatthewD23: Thank you, honestdoc, this is more really great info.  And both your response and the earlier reply from MattKW confirmed what I suspected (that \"just ripping them out and being done with it\" is not the easy, albeit expensive, answer someone might think it is).  \n\nI'm so glad I found this site, and appreciate these thoughtful replies =)"

    "title": "What is the best way to fill teeth?",
    "dialogue": "drmajidghiasi: which way is better? what method do you recommend?the price is important for me MattKW: Depends mostly on size and locations. Standard fillings are either amalgam or composite. In general, they are summarised as:\n\nComposite: tooth-coloured, costlier, shorter life expectancy, mostly used for front teeth and small to medium-sized holes in back teeth.\nAmalgam: ugly (silver), cheaper, longer life expectancy, used only for back teeth, medium to large holes. honestdoc: Sorry to confuse you even more but I see disadvantages of composites and amalgams.  For most fillings to last, the smaller the better especially on the biting surface.  Small amalgams can last a lifetime.  Bigger amalgams can stress the supporting tooth structure leading to potential cusp fractures.  Composite bonding is its weakest link.  Composites can shrink up to 2% during light curing leading to micro gaps and further decay.  Furthermore, the bonding agent can be soluble to saliva over time leading to further gaps.  Composites do look more pleasing especially on anterior teeth.\n\nI like to use Fuji Equia which is a modern glass ionomer restorative material.  It bonds naturally to tooth, releases Fluoride, and has desensitizing properties.  It is not as strong as composites although studies has demonstrated similar wear strengths but not as cosmetic.\n\nThe best product although fairly new is called Activa by Pulpdent.  It is a bioactive restorative material that establishes proper mineral intergration with the tooth.  Certain cells such as cementum has shown to grow over this material.  I don't see disadvantages other than price."

    "dialogue": "BabyBlueberry: Hullo! \n\nI'm new here, and I made an account specifically so I could ask this, but...\n\nThis phenomenon happens to me EVERY time I get a filling. I go in, get the initial numbing shots, and then I get laughing gas. It's a grand ole time. I can't feel a thing, you know, and I'm just there hanging out in the chair waiting for my dentist to start working on me, and then the drilling starts. When my dentist starts drilling my tooth (or it's a filling replacement, my body does not discriminate, it seems.), my world disappears. It's like my brain shuts off and my body goes numb and I get REALLY tired, and to be frank I generally think, \"Am I dying?\" which is usually followed by an \"I don't care\" which is a little alarming but I'm just so relaxed that I genuinely don't. I freaked my dentist and the attendants out one day asking them why I felt like that (They didn't give me an answer, either.), so, my question is, why do I just want to sleep forever and go numb when my dentist starts drilling on me? Note it's not while I'm on gas or numb, which I am of course, but this only specifically happens when she starts drilling, and goes away soon after. \n\nIs it vertigo? Am I in shock? I know I take a bit more numbing shot stuff (forgot the name) than most people and my nurses tend to give extra laughing gas, too, but I'm not sure if that matters or not. However I think that would eliminate shock. I've just always wondered why it happens. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the feeling is GREAT, I've never taken drugs before but it's how I would imagine a mega load of morphine to feel. It's concerning, though, as I assume you'd imagine. So, I just want to know what it is, why does it happen, and if it's bad or a condition of something else, or something. Busybee: Sounds like a reaction to the analgestics.  I didn't even think they still gave laughing gas.  I've never had it in my lifetime.   So it's probably a reaction to that you describe.  People use it as a recreational drug. BabyBlueberry: It just makes me wonder why it only happens when I'm being drilled on, and no other time, though I guess it could also be the feeling my pain receptors are sending in place of, you know, pain, since that is numbed. MattKW: A feeling of dying is sometimes associated with a high level of nitrous oxide. The ideal point with nitrous is to allow you to relax and dissociate from what's happening. the stronger the concentration, and the longer you use it, then greater the depth you will attain and the longer to fully recover. I'd ask for less nitrous. It can also depend on the nitrous machine. I prefer a standard scavenger mask with rebreathing bag, as I have greater control over what the patient receives. There is another version called Silhouette (by Porter) which is less obtrusive, but gives greater variation in flow, and some patients can get too deep all of a sudden, which gives the dying feeling, and maybe throw up. BabyBlueberry: That's.. kind of cool actually. Thank you for finally solving this for me, ever since I was a kid, I always wondered why that happened and after digging and digging, never could find out. I don't mind the feeling, it was mainly a fear of what was causing it, but I've never felt nauseous, just would fall asleep sometimes. Pretty great, I guess. I'll see what happens next time if I cam request it be turned down. Thanks again. <3 MattKW: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSounds like a reaction to the analgestics.

Great stuff, and using it recreationally (\"nanging\") is relatively low-risk if used carefully. Unfortunately, people don't always understand the risks. A couple died several years ago in Aust when they opened up a cylinder in a car with closed windows - ran out of oxygen and suffocated."

If it gets worse go see your dentist. MattKW: Go see a dentist. Sometimes teeth can \" die\" following trauma in an earlier time of your life, typically sporting activities, and the pain may not manifest for years because it has been a sterile death (no bacteria). If you're having that significant amount of pain, get it examined. A cold test (vitality test) is usually diagnostic; sometimes an Xray too.

For the past few years, I've been noticing gum recession all over my mouth.  I've been brushing as instructed by my hygienist.  I use Aim toothpaste, I floss at night and use a fluoride rinse before bed.

Any advice anyone can offer here? matejoslav: I am not sure but gum recession might be treated with surgery. I read somewhere that they will just take skin from somewhere else and put it on the receded gum to cover the tooth, I am not sure if that will improve the looseness of the teeth but it should improve sensitivity of the teeth. honestdoc: Unfortunately, there are so many reasons for gum recession.  Most likely your bite has changed and or your teeth are shifting.  Usually recession in absence of periodontal disease is caused by some kind of trauma (braces), and or hyper-eruption,  Have your dentist find the source(s) of the recession and discuss with you options to manage or treat it.

If you have a wisdom, you should talk to your dentist about having it extracted before it pushes over the 2nd molar. \nAhh ok so I was being too keen and quick dang it!! I was hoping to be back to eating crisps by now but guess Ill have to wait two weeks boo  do you know is it likely the clot will dislodge now? Or can I chill out about that? Also sounds stupid but what does the skin look like healed over? Currently it's just getting smaller but still as above (granted its only been a day since I posted ha) when can I safely eat back on that side? Ill take that as a compliment I'm 27! I had my back molars removed surgically when I was 4 :-o I keep thinking I have wisdom teeth but I can't seem to see or feel any? Although there isn't much space for it mind! callmejessicag: Ok so update on tooth-it appears to almost not be covering the full thing anymore? it's as if it's breaking down. We are now 5 days post extraction-is this normal?? Am i at risk of dry socket still? It's yellow/white-not sure if this is granulating tissue?\nAlso next to it on the gum you can see a small white line with some red around it-this is what's hurting the most it feels like a sharp scratch-Im guessing its where they put the injection.\nAny help greatly appreciated!!! honestdoc: The extraction site looks good.  The pink gums around the area indicates good healing response as opposed to bright red and swelling.  As my note on another post, \"the white/yellow material is the regenerating epithelial layer that is exposed to air. Underneath is your wounds natural clotting proteins that act as a scaffold for regenerating cells (odontoblasts) to naturally close the \"hole.\" In about 4-6 months, the wound site on x-ray should fill in similar to the surrounding bone area This is similar bone grafting concept for implant placement and bone healing.\" callmejessicag: honestdoc said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe extraction site looks good.

I guess I just want to make sure I respect the dentists work too...so is there a chance of me 'bursting' or 'knocking' the clot out? Or is it pretty safe now? Normal then to be shrinking over the hole?\nSorry for 20 questions! honestdoc: I wouldn't eat \"crisps\" on that site until you see pink similar to the surrounding areas.  In the US, we call it \"chips.\"  The hole will shrink because once you lose teeth, you lose bone as well.  The only way to preserve bone especially for future implant(s) is to put in bone grafts.  The bone grafts provide further scaffolding for regenerating bone to form. callmejessicag: Hello,\n\nMe again-so we are healing nicely the 'hole' feels smaller every day. My worry now (having got over a fear of dry socket) is that it hasn't 'closed over' instead its as if the clot has collapsed on it'self and there is now a crater-this means despite my best efforts tiny flecks of food are going in. I do wash it out and still chew on one side. I have little to no pain or anything and no other symptom.\nIs this normal?? MattKW: It takes 2-3 months to fully reshape and heal. Nothing you can do or eat now will cause any damage. callmejessicag: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIt takes 2-3 months to fully reshape and heal. Nothing you can do or eat now will cause any damage.

I didn't think to ask the dentist these things and I don't have a follow-up appointment. It was just tooth out....bye. And of course, all these things come up as you're experiencing them."

    "dialogue": "matejoslav: Please be aware that english is not my first language \n\nLittle story time of how my problem started. It was around January 2017, I was at uni living my student life. With that comes a lot of sweet and junk food. Around february I spotted some decay on my tooth in the back on the lower side of my jaw. I did not feel any pain so I ignored it for a while and scheduled my dentist appointment in March. So March comes and I feel a bit of pain but nothing serious, dentist cleaned it out and filled it.\nThis is the point where it started.\nAfter the procedure I went home and still had some pain which I contributed to the dental visit. Fast forward to August 2017 and I was still having pain in that area. I went to my dentist but she couldnt see anything and I was advised to see how it goes. The pain went down a bit and I just ignored it. It was just a slight pain in that area for few months. Barely noticeable.\nFast forward several months to March 2018. The pain got worse, its deep pain that is dull and not pulsating. I went to dentist and got an xray but there was nothing. He cleaned the area under gums to see if that helps. In the upcoming months the pain got more severe to the point where its hard to concentrate on work. And I got same pain on the otherside of the jaw. And yesterday I started to feel some weird tast in my mouth but it doesnt feel like decay (I had that before).\nDentist didnt find anything, posting here to get my mind of pain.\n\n*edit: I dont have fever and didnt have fever during the whole duration. Plus I was able to recover from cold so my immune system should be ok. lolzita: Does your bite when you close your mouth focuses on that particular tooth?\n\nI had something similar, and I realized it was due to my bad bite. Every time I eat my upper molar bangs on that tooth repeatedly. Dentist couldn't see anything. I tried for a few weeks to stop eating on that side and the pain subsided. Probably ligament inflammation in my opinion matejoslav: lolzita said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDoes your bite when you close your mouth focuses on that particular tooth?\n\nI had something similar, and I realized it was due to my bad bite.

Probably ligament inflammation in my opinion My molars dont touch when I bite. Only on one side. I know that my wisdom teeth are starting to appear on top of my jaw on both sides and that is quite painfull. Some people say that the nerves are connected so maybe its that. The pain is now on both sides of my lower jaw with the left side having pain for more than a year and right side started 2 days ago. \n\nMakes me feel depressed sometimes since every dentist said that he thinks everything is ok. Busybee: If you could post an x ray then one of the dentists here might present an opinion. matejoslav: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIf you could post an x ray then one of the dentists here might present an opinion.

The gum started to bleed when I was brushing my teeth. \nLeft side still unknown. Busybee: I'd have thought a dentist would have noticed that straight away.  You can request x rays from the dentist.  The surgery can email them to you."

    "title": "What is causing my mouth pain?",
    "dialogue": "kitsuac: For about a year, there has been a constant pain in my mouth. It seems to radiate all across the upper teeth and gums and to some degree the roof of the mouth. I can reduce the pain by pressing my thumb against the back of my upper front teeth and the roof of my mouth. The pain is also reduced when wearing a mouth guard which covers that same area. The pain is pulsating and relatively dull but significant enough that it's distracting all day long (similar to having a tooth-ache)\n\nMy dentist hasn't had much to say about it, other than a vague idea that it could be related to grinding my teeth. I've never in my life caught myself grinding me teeth, and the pain isn't at the top of the teeth at all, so that doesn't ring true to me. It also doesn't seem to fit anyone's description of tooth grinding pain that I've heard of. Aside from this pain, I get A+ checkups at the dentist so it doesn't seem to be something obvious like a cavity.\n\nIt's unpleasant to be in pain 24 hours a day, and it's frustrating that my dentist doesn't seem interested in offering any additional help figuring out how to identify the problem or manage the pain at least. Looking for any tips on how to figure this out and get some relief. Busybee: Are you sure it's not sinus pain or similar?  I am asking only because I know that there is a pressure point in the roof of the mouth.  If you want to sneeze the way to stop it is to press your tongue into the roof of the mouth.   Pressing the area could just temporarily stop the nerve transmitting.   Have your wisdom teeth erupted? kitsuac: That sounds like a good idea to investigate. My wisdom teeth were removed around 10 years ago. The dentist has given me no indication that there are any tooth problems, but odd to me that the pain seems so focused around the teeth and gums. I guess that all the nerves are connected so it's difficult to know where pain is coming from sometimes.\n\nNow that you mention it, even pressing toward the back of the roof of my mouth really decreases the pain. Maybe better if I switch over to a forum about sinus problems honestdoc: How you would know if you have sinus pain is more pronounced pain upon bending forward, laying back, going up or downstairs.  I'm still suspecting grinding and clenching because you don't realize when you are grinding/clenching and the bite guard is helping. kitsuac: The bite guard is easing the pain just by applying pressure against the back of my teeth / roof of mouth. I can put the guard on any time throughout the day when the pain is bothering me and it's almost immediately relief. Doesn't seem to have anything to do with preventing grinding, just the pressure. honestdoc: Apparently it is relieving your pain...always a positive result.  There are so many benefits to the bite guard.  Other benefits include preventing clenching and supporting your TMJ. kitsuac: I've also started to use it while mountain biking. The trails that I ride have very rocky, fast downhills and at times I've noticed my teeth knocking against each other which is no good. lolzita: Seems similar to what I'm experiencing... you can check out here\nhttps://www.dentistry-forums.com/th...-in-front-teeth-help.23039/page-2#post-120493\n\nWas there an initial trauma in your case? How did it start? kitsuac: I don't remember exactly when it started, unfortunately. But if there was initial trauma, it was almost certainly during a mountain biking wreck or a particularly bad CHOMP while bouncing down a rocky hill. I'm at such a high heart rate and pumped full of endorphins that I don't really notice pain while riding, it all just blurs together.\n\nIt seems similar to what these people are describing, but not completely. I've been fortunate so far (knock on wood) that the pain goes away almost completely using a mouth guard and carefully positioning it just right. I've wondered sometimes if there's damaged skin which isn't healing and the mouth guard is soothing it, covering the nerves."

Lol MattKW: If you're past the 5-day mark without serious pain, then you are not going to get a dry socket. The white stuff is either tissue sloughing off (like a wet scab), or food particles. Either way it will do no harm. You are in the clear, and the wound will continue to heal and close up over the next couple of weeks. honestdoc: Dr. MattKW is correct.  You are in the clear.

    "title": "Some questions for pre-wisdom removal !",
    "dialogue": "Zammo: Hi. I am having my lower right wisdom tooth out this Friday. Just wondered some advice. I have included a few photos and panoramic scan to help. I have always been a \"wait and see\" type person with teeth, as I hate seeing dentists, but I have been told it is important I have this tooth removed, as I had awful pain at Christmas which was cured by antibiotics, and I have needed the bite lowered twice as it kept raising up. I still wanted to put it off, but have finally decided to go for it, but I have some concerns. I have been totally pain free for 5 months now. I do though have a slight redding colour on the gum near the tooth, only slight, not sure if this denotes anything.\n\n1) I have been told I will need bone cut away and the tooth sectioned when removed. I personally was hoping just an elevator tool could be used to jack the tooth out, but what are your opinions on it ? Is there an easier way than having to cut bone and cut the tooth up ? Surgical extractions always cost a lot more than simple.\n\n2) My dentist a few months back shaved down my wisdom tooth as I complained of high bite, they seem to have shaved it down a lot, is this why it is harder now to remove due to not much grip ? Or given the tooth has a massive hole in it, would it likely have needed surgical removal anyway ? I have included a side view and how flat it looks now since bite reduction, before reduction it was around the same height as the 2nd molar you can just see, although still with the big 2 holes.\n\n3) I thought the nerves looked good on the x-ray as they were far away from the roots, but the dentist said they are still close, around 2mm. Should I be concerned about them given this is a surgical removal ? To me they look further than 2mm away from the root, but then I am not a dentist.\n\n4) How concerned also about the lingual nerve should I be ?\n\n5) Looking at the tooth, if I decided to just leave it, would that be wise ? Or a bad idea ? I am not sure whether to let sleeping dogs lie. I am 40 years old.\n\nThanks for any help, so much appreciated, I am panicking a bit for Friday. Sorry for so many questions. Oh and on the questions, the side view was taken when I had a temp cream coloured filling cover on my tooth, that has since gone, as seen in other photo. MattKW: You've been here before. I remember the crease in the X-ray.\n\nHe might be able to loosen it a bit with an elevator and grab with forceps. It's an upright tooth with uncomplicated roots.\nThe hole on the inside (lingual) is the biggest question for getting good forceps grip. The height of the tooth is immaterial.\nThe roots are well away from the inferior alveolar nerve, and I wouldn't have any worries about that, even if it becomes a surgical extraction. \n\nYou always have to be a bit wary about the lingual nerve as it can be just below the gum on the inner side of the tooth. If he grasps the tissue poorly with forceps, or makes an incision or tears the tissue on the lingual side, then you'd be in trouble. Still unlikely though. I've had more issues with IAN than lingual.\nVery bad idea to leave alone. Dogs don't sleep forever, and neither will this tooth. As it continues to decay, it will make it more difficult to remove. Zammo: Hi there. Big thanks, I was hoping you would reply as I know you are a dentist. Actually I have not been on this forum before, but if you frequent other places you may have seen my x-ray there. My out of control anxiety is making me ask about different places \n\nCan I follow up with some questions ? \n\nI was a bit confused when the dentist said \"no, they are right there next to it\" when I made comment that I was happy the roots are away from the nerve, as like you say, it seems far away to me. My normal dentist also said they seem far away (he sent me to this oral surgeon though in case tooth broke up). Do you think this is just likely the oral surgeon being extra careful to say the nerves there still a concern ?\n\nSo even though I am pain free right now, I should still go ahead with this in your opinion ? The lingual nerve risks don't outweigh the risk of leaving the tooth in ? In your expert opinion, with my tooth from what you see in the photos (which I realise is not as good as seeing in person), how risky is this for me to have done without damage to the lingual nerve ? \n\nI wish I didn't have that hole on the tongue side, as like you say, if he cuts bone there then it is right by the lingual nerve. \n\nFinally, on the cheek side of the gum, in the crease of my mouth, so right at the very back where the wisdom tooth gum meets the crease of cheek, there is a slight red dot, very small, could this be an infection from the tooth leaking in to the mouth ? It is just below the wisdom tooth on the gum. As something caused my tooth to raise up twice needing the bite reduced. However antibiotics stopped any pain in the 3rd day of taking them.\n\nSorry for all the questions, you are a good man doing this advice for free, much appreciated. Given I am \"going in\" on Friday I only have 1 day to cancel if I feel it too risky, haha. I chickened out of having the root removed from another tooth that broke (you can still see the root in the x-ray) and this was 10 years ago, I was told to have it taken out as it would cause problems, but touch wood so far the root is still fine buried. Hence why I am always tempted to leave things, but I know one day I will be unlucky."

It's self-inflicted from over-zealous brushing maybe using a hard brush. The dentist can talk to you about changing your habits. This is too early to worry about gum grafting, and if it doesn't progress, it might just stay like this. honestdoc: How you can tell you are brushing too hard is to look at your toothbrush bristles.  Are they looking destroyed?  A soft bristled toothbrush should look like new when you throw it out after 3-4 months.  Another less likely factor is history of braces putting trauma to the bone as well as grinding and clenching. Busybee: i think this is poor technique rather than over zealousness.  Looks like old fashioned up and down brushing rather than the recommended way."

What do you think it is? is it serious.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/oQiF1BG\n\nThanks for your help MattKW: Your dentist is correct: Fordyce granules, or sebaceous glands, totally normal. Nothing to do with smoking, although you should give it up for other reasons!"

    "dialogue": "Francesca_curious: I have been having problems with my mouth for the last 2-3 weeks. It started as a pain at the back of my mouth, which was also causing slight ear ache and jaw ache. I went to the dentists about a week ago. He thought that the pain was related to the fact that my bottom wisdom tooth is lying flat beneath the gum, so my top wisdom tooth was growing too much and was digging into my gums, causing them to be painful. He shaved some of the top wisdom tooth off and it seemed to make sense. However, I am still in as much pain, or even more. Also there are other symptoms, my salivia smells bad and I have general throat pain too. Also, what I only noticed recently is I have something which looks like a hole in the corner of my mouth between the gum and cheek which is very sore (the same side with the problem wisdom tooth). The pain in that side of the mouth is really sore, opening my mouth hurts, and when I wake up I can only describe it as feeling like its on fire. I'm not sure what to do and whether I need to go back to the dentist?\n\nAny help much appreciated. MattKW: So it sounds like pericoronitis, or gum infection, of that lower wisdom tooth. Shaving a bit off the top wisdom will get it away from biting into the lower gum, but does nothing to address the infection. Go back to the dentist, get an OPG X-ray, and see if the wisdom teeth (upper and lower) should be extracted. Francesca_curious: Okay I will do, thanks very much. I thought it could be some kind of infection but didn't want to waste the dentists time if it was just something which would naturally recover."

It's been non stop. \nSo the.higher dentist in the practice started looking at me closely. All new x-rays, diet and meds etc..\nConclusion is that my teeth are decaying rapidly mainly because 5 or 6 of my meds cause dry mouth, exacerbated by my higher carb vegan diet. \nOnly decent solution supposedly is to pull all my teeth, put in 5 implants on top and 2 on the bottom and get special dentures that attach to the implants. Total cost around $30k.\n\nAny thoughts about if this sounds legit or not  or how common this is or alternative solutions would be appreciated. \n\nThanks Busybee: I'm sure it's possible for meds to cause dry mouth and it's known that dry mouth is bad for teeth, but you should seek a second and maybe third opinion on the treatment that has been proposed.  I'm sure there are more conservative options.   It's also important to limit caffeine and alcohol and to pay meticulous attention to dental hygiene. MattKW: Take X-rays (past and present) and records to get a 2nd opinion. Lots of meds cause dry mouth, but rarely to the extent which you describe (except for drug addicts!). You've prob been taking some of those meds for a while before this sudden change, so why would this suddenly seem to occur? \nLook to your frequency of eating - are you eating lots of in-between food? Are you using bottled water or fluoridated tap water? Do you use fluoride t'paste, or even change to a higher form? Use a chlorhexidine mouthwash."

    "dialogue": "Andy Benson: I have visited the dentist , had X rays and have been told there is no infection and no holes. \nDentist said it is most likely gum disease but it doesnt feel like that its seems more nerve related\nPain is awful I cant eat or drink and have had to take ibuprofen with codeine constantly for around 10 days\nIf I drink hot tea the heat will cause agony\nDoes anyone have any other advice on options or causes ?\nShould I just visit another dentist and get a second opinion ? MattKW: Pain caused from hot, cold, or sweet means there is a hole or fracture in a tooth. It does not mean an infection, so don't get antibiotics. If your dentist can't find cause of pain, then get second opinion. Take the X-rays with you. Also get an OPG X-ray if possible. honestdoc: As Dr MattKW mentioned, with no infection (swelling) don't get antibiotics.  If the dentist or various dentists can't find the hole, defect, or source of pain, a common possibility is that you are grinding and or clenching.  Sometimes it can present significant pain. Busybee: I was about to post that it could be your bite.  But honestdoc just said the same.  Grinding and high bite can cause sensitivity at gum level.   This can feel very intense.   It can feel like the tooth is dying but can disappear once the bite is corrected.   It's really complex because nine times out of ten dentists don't know the best approach.  If they go in and start drilling they could end up with unnecessary work and no relief of symptoms.  I'd advise you to get a soft night guard made.  If you feel relief from pain when you wake in the morning then it may be bite related.   Alternatively you might have a crack but cracks tend to have specific  symptoms which can be tested by a dentist.  But sensitivity caused by bite problems is very difficult to diagnose.  In fact some dentists will tell you it's all in your mind!  Be prepared for that."

    "dialogue": "CLARE: For many years, one of my premolars has had a veneer on it. I've had no trouble from it at all. Then recently, It fell off. The dentist fixed this, but after a few months it happened again. My dentist then asked me to consider a crown as this procedure is more appropriate and robust for this type of tooth. \n\nI decided to go for it, which meant having the re-attarched veneer removed so that she could take an impression; she then re-attatched my veneer once again. \n\nUnfortunately, the mold wasn't suitable for the crown to be made, so I had to repeat the previous procedure, which meant having the veneer removed by drilling and hammering, so that I could have another impression taken.\n\nThis time my dentist put a temp crown over my tooth. After only a few days, part of the temporary crown came away, exposing part of my tooth. Then today more of my tooth has broken, leaving a tiny stump of tooth, which is so sensitive I can barely eat. \n\nMy question is, is this down to my dentists negligence? Also, what can now be done? There Is a huge gap and I'm really self conscious of it, plus the sensitivity is painful. What is the best option? \n\nMany thanks honestdoc: For the most part, dentists make a good faith effort to work on your teeth.  Events like yours happen more than we like.  Hopefully your dentist will make it right for you.  \n\nDepending on the extent of damage, a new temporary crown must be made and placed.  Teeth shift everyday and tend to shift from the back forward and from the opposing to the broken tooth.  If you wait too long, the final crown may not fit right.  Hopefully this helps. MattKW: Premolars are difficult teeth to treat because of their small size. Sometimes I don't do crowns  for them, but repair as best I can and advise the patient to save up for an implant. If your remaining tooth is too small, you can go as far as to intentionally remove the nerve (RCT), then a post (wrought or cast) and core, and a crown. That's a lot of expense, and treatment, and still at risk of failure. Talk to your dentist or get another opinion - ask for options and relative risks. Busybee: I don't understand why you didn't go back to the dentist as soon as the temporary crown started to fall apart.  It's quite important to keep this on to protect the tooth. I also don't understand why a dentist would not be able to see that their impression was not good enough for a crown preparation when the patient is still in the surgery.  Normally the dentist checks this just as soon as the mould has set.   If there are bubbles or bits missing they redo it in the surgery straight away.      Have you made an appointment to get this looked at?"

Pulp capping will fail in 3-12 months; it never works well except as a temporary measure before a planned RCT. The cavity in adjacent tooth will not get better no matter how much you floss and cover with fluoride; at best you might slow it down. Yes, it is possible to have an RCT, and then place a deep filling, but you'll find it will be a plaque trap and cause even more decay in the adjacent tooth. Cut your losses and get rid of the worst tooth so you can have a small and simple filling in the adjacent tooth."

    "dialogue": "RootandFive: I had a bit of an epic dental gong show, I won't bother going into all the details unless anyone really wants to know... It was basically an issue with a root canal that got really out of hand (as in I was told I didn't have a dental problem in 3 visits to dental offices but after being tested for things like kidney and thyroid problems it turns out it was a dental problem) Through a complaints process I found out there was a claim that a PA X-ray of the tooth in question during my first appointment that I tried to tell this dentist that there was something wrong with this root canal, one month exactly after the root canal was done, I knew this X-ray hadn't been taken because I remember leaving that appointment feeling like it was pointless because they weren't even looking for a problem. I got my records through the complaint process (with no X-rays) and the record for that appointment says there was a PA X-ray taken that was compared to the post op X-ray from the month earlier. I asked for my X-rays from the dentist and after a bit of a run around I received poor quality photocopies which didn't include this X-ray but did include what to me what to me looked like a second copy of the post op X-ray with no date. I asked the dentist about this and never received a response. My complaint was closed with no regulatory criticism of the dentist, through the review process I was able to see all the complaint investigation records and the complaint investigator asked for the PA X-ray in question and received the post op X-ray with the date changed, they recognized this and asked for the correct one at which point the receptionist said there must have been a typo because there was no X-ray on this date. The review process also closed with no criticism of the investigation...\n\nI'm floored... I come from an aviation maintenance background and if I had changed a date on a record and submitted this to my regulating authority I would have been in a massive heap of trouble... I was curious if this is acceptable to dentists anywhere?! Busybee: Hi, it's not acceptable for any dentist to tamper with your records.  But I don't know what country you are in or the laws there.  \n\nIs your tooth and health ok now? RootandFive: Thanks for asking Busybee! Health is fine now other than I'm still missing the tooth, it was extracted, since had a sinus surgery to clean out what the dental infection left there (there was an 18mm cyst around the roots of this tooth in my sinus), then a graft to deal with the scar tissue from the sinus surgery, then a dental implant that failed and had to be removed about four months after I got the crown (implant was totally loose and came out with the healing abutment, which had been put back on after two months with the crown that I could never put pressure on) I still also have the ringing in my left ear that started around two months after the root canal but I'm just learning to deal with it... I dealt with tons of headaches which took a long time (well over a year) to get back to normal and I did 9 rounds of antibiotics in 2016, it took a heck of a long time (and a ton of probiotics and antacids) for my stomach to get back to normal...\n\nIt's just been an incredibly frustrating process because I feel like there's some lessons to be learned to prevent this type thing from happening again (the dentist is very experienced) but it seems like the process in place is only interested in sweeping everything under the rug. Busybee: Did the same dentist do the implant? RootandFive: Nope, Periodontist did the implant, I have no complaint with them, they were actually a ton of help, I saw them for a consultation about replacing the tooth but they were the one to actually inform me about the problem in my sinus and talked with my doctor and helped get things moving in the right direction to get the infection cleared up. I know they took a very cautious attempt at the implant as not to do any more damage to my sinus but I can't help but wonder if that infection being there for as long as it was damaged the bone.. Busybee: Ok, it's funny but sometimes the professionals who you feel have done the best job because they have a good attitude, haven't really done as well as you think.  A perio is for gums and should have referred you for an implant.  You could try an implant specialist to see if they can help replace the tooth.   Periodontists should stick to their specialty. RootandFive: The periodontist's site says they're also a specialist in implant surgery and holds a master's degree in Craniofacial Science with a thesis on the stability of dental implants, so probably qualified... the implant failed but they didn't ever refuse to help me, they didn't leave me sick for months with what turned out to be a dental infection like the dentist (who was an endodontist) that did the root canal and then diagnosed there was no problem with an X-ray that was never taken... the Periodontist also fixed up my cheek because the scar tissue from the sinus surgery made my cheek feel tight and I could feel it all the time... The Periodontist's conversation with my doctor got me to an ENT dr. months sooner, so yeh, it sucks my implant failed but I think that has more to do with the endodontist's actions than the periodontist's.. Busybee: So the endodontist, was that the dentist that you first saw?   Was that a specialist? RootandFive: Yeh, well, a general dentist referred me to the endodontist that did the root canal, they're the one that said they took the X-ray that was never taken. It seem like my complaint investigator, another very experienced dentist, was more interested in covering the endodontist's mistake than anything else and it's made fair treatment pretty much impossible. (this was a tooth that couldn't be frozen at all during the first attempt but was then done in one appointment after a week on antibiotics, from what I've learned since it shouldn't be entirely surprising that it was still giving me problems or that this infection ended up in my sinus) Busybee: So why did you go to a periodontist for an implant? RootandFive: It was a referral, they're a periodontist that also specialised in implants. Busybee: You've certainly had an awful time of it, but I am glad you are feeling a lot better now.  You could try to take it further legally depending on the laws of your country, perhaps a legal expert in negligence claims could help you find a different angle to pursue a case.  This is why I always advise people to get a second opinion when they have a dental problem.   It seems you were not a good candidate for an implant which is why I was asking who did it.  Are you able to get a bridge? RootandFive: Just curious, why would you say I wasn't a good candidate for an implant? I was informed it wasn't optimal because of the history of infection so I don't think I was given unrealistic expectations but I don't think this periodontist would have gone forward if they hadn't been reasonably confident it would have been successful. This gong show was more complicated that I've bothered explaining but I had the root canal in Jan.2016, got a second opinion Apr.1st, 2016, (was offered a retreatment by a second endodontist with 50% chance of success but wasn't told about what was going on in my sinus) had the tooth pulled Apr.4th, started feeling better within the next week then started feeling sick again three weeks later, saw the periodontist late May, had them look at the apr.1 dental CT which is when I was told there was the cyst... Made it to the ENT who sent me to an oral surgeon who cleaned out my sinus mid june...\n\nHad the implant placed in the end of Oct.2016, they did a sinus bump instead of a sinus lift because they didn't want to risk more damage to my sinus or access it a second time through that bone in my cheek, so it was a 6mm implant (tooth 26) but apparently it was a very highend implant that they thought was going to do the trick. Apparently is looked totally integrated and I got the crown in late May 2017 but I couldn't put pressure on it from day 1, after two months I had the crown removed and the healing cap put on because I was only chewing on one side and that was causing more jaw problems (which seems to be what started the tinnitus too) The plan was to wait and see, I was also scheduled for an MRI because of the headaches and tinnitus. then in Sept.2017 I noticed the healing cap seemed loose only it wasn't the healing cap, it was the entire implant. There was no infection when it failed, it just wasn't fused to the bone at all anymore, when it came out the periodontist noted that they could see the thread marks in the bone still if that means anything?\n\nIt has now been recommended I get a bridge... which I have to pay for from scratch after already having paid out $5700 beyond what my insurance covered... I'm hesitant to have this gong show include two teeth that have never given me any trouble (one of which is my only other root canaled tooth with a crown). I'm nervous that if I get a bridge and have any issues with it it'll be like this misadventure never ended and I'm mad as hell but more about how I was treated through the complaints process than the dental end of this...\n\nI've seen the ENT Dr. again and he didn't have concerns of problems if I were to get a sinus lift and try an implant again though the Periodontist doesn't think I should try again... I'm just curious how time with no tooth there effects the bone? Would another attempt be even less likely to succeed or would more time to heal improve chances? To me I'd rather pay more now and not mess with two problem free teeth but obviously I won't if it doesn't look like a good idea... (Again I should say, this periodontist has been a huge help, even if that implant failed, I got sick a third time after all this, and it felt just like when I got sick again after the tooth came out only this time it was a mother strep throat with oral thrush bad enough that the skin got all blistered around my mouth... I think I'd basically beaten the living crap out of my immune system over the last year and for the first time ever was dealing with a real anxiety issue around infection and this periodontist spent extra time and effort with me (and was willing to personally e-mail with me) to answer questions and help convince me that this dental infection was 100% gone...\n\nI'm still working on getting resolution for this, basically the legal end of things was impossible (I'm in Canada, my complaint was closed the day before the dentist involved became a board member of this province's regulatory authority... So basically I have to have an opinion that the standard of care wasn't met from a dentist who would have to be speaking out against a member of the board of their own regulating authority.... good luck with that one huh?) Busybee: RootandFive said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tJust curious, why would you say I wasn't a good candidate for an implant? Purely what you've posted about having a long standing infection and then damage to your sinus area.   They told you that you were not optimal so it's surprising they went ahead.  I'm not a dentist but the way you have described it you didn't have a good foundation for an implant.   The longer you have an untreated infection the greater the chance of bone loss.     How do you feel without a tooth there? MattKW: RootandFive said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe periodontist's site says they're also a specialist in implant surgery ... Yes, there is no defined specialty role for implants. Periodontists often do the implant placement because they are experienced in tissue management. RootandFive: In response to the post that is no longer here;\n\nThis is the photocopy I received when I asked for my X-rays, this is the post op X-ray;\n\n\n\n\nThere's a claim there was a PA X-ray taken Feb.19th when I went back saying there was something wrong which I knew hadn't been taken but I received this without a date; (looks familiar?) (by the way, I didn't have a temporary crown by Feb.19th)\n\n\n\n\nI went back again on Mar.9 trying to get help and was told it wasn't a dental problem and the only help I was offered was that \"there's always the emergency room\" I was shown this X-ray to prove I didn't have a dental problem causing my sinus issues; (and yes, that date is wrong)\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are screen shots from Apr.1st when I went for a second opinion (my sinus had been clear on all my X-rays prior to this root canal)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had enough as I'd been feeling slowly sicker and sicker since late February, I had what I think is a panic attack (my first and only one I've ever had, I'm sure it was due to pure exhaustion) Apr.3rd and being that I was given a 50/50 shot of successful retreatment, which I was booked for on the 13th, I had the tooth pulled on the 4th.\n\nI started feeling better for a bit and started feeling sick again three weeks later, this is my May.31st medical CT scan. I hadn't been told by the second endodontist that there was any issue with my sinus, nor was there any mention of it in his info to the referring general dentist I went to for the second opinion. I ended up having a sinus surgery in June.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the extracted tooth, the left root was opened up by the dentist who did the extraction because he thought there might be a file in there which wasn't the case, it was just a blue filler, the root on the right has to canals with fillers visible, I was told this had nothing to do with my issues by my complaint investigator but I don't believe this one bit anymore. MattKW: In the X-rays, all root canals appear to be well done in the first molar and premolar. Just because you had a cyst doesn't mean it was of dental origin; in fact, they are quite rare. On OPG X-rays I often see cysts in the maxillary sinuses. These are assumed to be mucous retention cysts (MRCs), and require no treatment unless the patient is having sinus problems (go Google them). I simply point them out to patients and ask if they're having any issues. Most stay unchanged, some get slightly larger, and some shrink away to nothing. I strongly doubt that your cyst was of dental origin, and it may be that the tooth was extracted unnecessarily, sorry .\nThe removal of the cyst should not caused any damage to the bone in the area of the implant because the surgeons wouldn't access through that region. However, the extraction of the molar would have caused some bone loss. \nThe \"quality\" of an implant is only a small factor in the success or failure. The most important factors are probably the density (quality) of the bone, and the size of the implant. Both of these factors were less than ideal in your situation. It doesn't matter much about the supposed quality of the implant itself. A sinus lift doesn't really make things much better, so I can understand why the periodontist is shying away from this again.\nThe risk entailed with a bridge here come from the root-filled premolar. Using root-filled teeth for bridge abutments is risky. At the very least you would need to reinforce the premolar with a cast post and core. An alternative is to extract the premolar(!), then place an implant in this space, then bridge that to the 2nd molar. I'd seek the advice of a prosthodontist. RootandFive: I guess the 'good' thing is that I don't feel that tooth was not the cause of my problems and extracted for no reason. the reasons I'm convinced the cyst was dental related are as follows:\n\n-black/clear sinus on PA X-rays up until the root canal\n-started having sinus issues shortly after the Jan.19 root canal that slowly got worse\n-Mar.2nd PA X-ray of that tooth had cloudy sinus and it had a sensitivity to percussion by the original referring dentist who told me to go talk to the endodontist again.\n-2nd Endodontist, though not explaining the sinus issue said that my 26 tooth was causing a chronic infection that was responsible for my symptoms, both him and the referring general dentist found a sensitivity to percussion that I didn't have before the root canal.\n-blood tests kept on getting slowly further out of the normal range, white count kept going up\n-when I started feeling sick again after the tooth had come out the spot where the tooth had come out became incredible sensitive to any sort of jarring motion like stepping down too hard, this went away after a couple days on another round of antibiotics\n-Periodontist's records says the cyst was from the dental infection,\n-ENT records explained way he didn't think it was a mucous retention cyst and sent me to the oral surgeon because it was dental related.\n-Oral surgeon who cleaned out my sinus said there had definitely been a sinus communication\n-I kept my original ENT appointment with the only ENT Dr. in my town which was months after I had seen a different ENT that could see me sooner because my ear hasn't stopped ringing, he also thought my sinus problems were related to my 26 tooth.\n-I've never seen a doctor for sinus issues in the 36 years before this gong show or the two years since I had that sinus surgery..."

    "dialogue": "dontsaycheese: I apologize if I am posting in the wrong place. Im looking/hoping for advise on my teeth issues. I am trying to figure out the best way to afford my dental work. If I had to guess, it's going to cost me over 25k$. Everyone close to me that i've asked has given me ( in my opinion ) shitty advise on how to pay for it. The advise I've got so far was to put it on a credti card or call a company called CareCredit. Both of these charge around 20% interest. I realize i've dug my own grave, but I'm trying to find a way out of it. My \" advise givers\" have the best intentions in their heart, but don't necessarily make the smartest financial decisions. \nMy question to a dentist that is willing to answer is\n\nI don't have the money to pay up front for serious dental work. I also dont want to sign a bad contract with a shady company. What is my best option?  Are there dentist that do payment plans without the huge interest cost? ( Please forgive me if I sound ignorant on the subject, cause I am). Busybee: It depends on your country of residence. dontsaycheese: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIt depends on your country of residence. US... ive been considering \"dental tourism\"... I'm scared about if its safe..... any advise would be much appreciated Busybee: Don't go to a dentist just because of the credit plan, but go because of reputation and because you feel comfortable and safe.   I'd recommend a separate personal loan at a low interest rate from a reputable lender, but I don't know what's available in the US or of your personal circumstances.   Dental tourism can be risky.  It's a long way to travel if things go wrong.  \n\nWhat work are you having done?"

Every time I floss it smells like death I get a weird taste if i suck from that side of my mouth, they told me to just take antibiotics and I had probably bruised my implant because I had a heavy bite. They shaved my implant down and matched it flush with my other teeth so a few days ago I started experiencing really bad gum pain on my entire mouth so I went to another dentist to get a second opinion. Everything was fine with the implant its self but apparently I have 6 cavities going for a 3rd appointment here soon because I just don't see me having 6!  I think he was just trying to steel my money and the gum pain he just said I had the start of gingivitis but I have 0 gum bleeding hence why I think he is trying to steel my money quote for 1600$ but that is besides the fact.\n\nwhat could cause this pressure pain and sometime its feel like it did before I had the tooth pulled a very very needle like pain but now I have pressure added on top of this\n\nSo what could it be that 2 dentist don't see anything wrong with my implant x ray that is causing this pressure they have poked and prodded my gums around the implant with 0 bleeding. I just don't see how you can bruise a implant between these dentist visits and being disabled vet on a fixed income I have already put out 1900$ for this implant do I just cut my loss and have it taken out i'm about to just say screw it and have the rest of my 30 teeth pulled a put dentures in at 28 because I don't ever want to deal with this money rape again how can people charge 250$ a piece for 6 fillings when a patient doesn't use anesthesia and is getting them all done at once why does it feel like every dentist I have been to is trying to rape me\n\n\nlast part was just a vent but yea needed to get that off MattKW: Hope the venting made you feel better! If you could get some X-rays to post up here, that'd help a lot.. Generally you shouldn't be shaving down implants, so I'm wondering if something is happening to the adjacent teeth. gster: Forgot to get X-rays I go back in 10 days and I will grab.\n\nThey cut the crown out and put a healing cap on the implant but I don’t feel any pressure, only if I push against my implant one way and it’s only the one way that does it.\n\n it feels like my whole upper mouth is expanding to my my nose at least it’s out now and not forcing the pressure by being in \n\nAnd it’s not pain it’s just a pure pressure feeling felt like they where drilling in a cavity though when they took it out \n\nAlso they added bone to my implant When it was put in \nThat is as much as I can give but I will post pics up in 10 days the other dentist I went to wanted 72$ for the X-rays so yea there is that also"

    "title": "Root Canal Treatment question?",
    "dialogue": "aindriu80: Hi,\n\nRecently I went to the dentist and got a filling after a chip developed in my second molar upper tooth and I was having some pain. The dentist took the whole insides of the tooth out, examined the insides of the tooth and put in a temporary filling .  I came back after a month, the dentist looked at it again, saw no infection, and gave me a white filling.  Its all I could budget for.  The dentist said I would have to look at a root canal treatment if I want a better solution.\n\nI left the dentist still with some pain but a great deal less pain than I had before the filling.  Basically if i chew on the upper 2nd molar now I still get some sharp nerve soreness but i can use the other side of my mouth and its an OK fix for the short term.\n\nWill a root canal treatment solve my soreness on the same tooth ? It's like a sharp sore nerve  but its something that can wait several months but worth it to get fixed.  I want to know what exactly would I have to get done, like would I need a crown afterwards or will filling do ? Maybe filling is too soft ? MattKW: He \"saw no infection\"? You look for cracks maybe under a filling, but infection is determined by pulp tests (usually cold sprays) or sometimes X-rays. White fillings have a greater chance of post-op pain than amalgams, so I'd suggest maybe replacing it with a good amalgam. Honestly, the only really significant advantage of a composite over an amalgam is the colour. Would you rather have a car with a dodgy paint job but trouble-free motor (amalg), or a flashy outside and a temperamental engine (comp)? I'm not saying you can't do good comps, but if someone comes in with a touchy tooth, I'd prefer not to take the risk of worsening it with a composite. Busybee: I wish dentists still used amalgam in the UK but many have completely stopped.  I hate composite but it's the only option in many cases.   The EU are trying to ban amalgam because of the mercury content.  The BDA are fighting a full ban but it's expected to be phased out by 2030. aindriu80: The dentist did recommend dark filling for the molar but I went for white, looking back I should have went for something stronger than white.\n\nThey quoted me R.C.T today for €500, including a filling. So I'm going to get that at some stage. I just wonder, will that cure the localised pain under the tooth, it's a bit difficult trying to describe it to a dentist, even after an x Ray. Busybee: I'd get a second opinion.  You might have a crack.   I don't understand why he did a temporary filling, was it because you didn't want to spend money on a filling and then find you needed more work?  How did you feel when you had the temporary filling?  Was it better or worse than now? aindriu80: He did a temporary filling to wait a month and see how I was getting along.  He wanted to see if there was any infection or any other teeth affected.  After a month it was just a bit better all round.\n\nThe temporary filling was actually quiet good and I thought the white filling would be an improvement again, but the temporary filling and white filling are about the same but I had real pain the day I got the white filling, ultra sensitive. \n\nI could see another dentist and ask them about it but its sometimes hard to describe it to a dentist in the dental surgery Busybee: You should only have a root treatment if there is an infection present and if that's the case the sooner the better.  \n\nIf you go to another dentist tell them that you want to know if there are any signs of an infection in the root and get them to test the tooth to see if there is any sign of a crack.    Don't tell them what the other dentist has said, just tell them your symptoms so they can make a totally objective examination.   Do not have a root treatment unless there is a clear infection present.  Try cheaper and less invasive options first.\n\nIf there is no sign of infection on examination and x ray then it's worth asking for the filling to be replaced as Matt has suggested.    Or it may be worth getting an onlay to protect the tooth if the dentist suspects there may be a crack.  When the dentist opens up the tooth they should be able to see if there is a crack and whether it goes beyond the gum margin.   \n\nIt's possible that if you wait a few weeks the tooth may settle on its own.   It's possible it's a bit high in one area and adjusting that bit down might help.     It could be that when they etched the tooth before placing the filling they irritated the nerve with the acid.  That can settle in two to three months.    It's worth waiting a little longer before having any work done, but get the second opinion about 6 to 8 weeks after the white filling was placed.  By then you should be able to see signs of an infection if it's there. aindriu80: I'm going to wait a little longer before I do anything and get a second opinion as you suggest.  Thanks for the useful advice, it's very helpful hearing feedback!"

But they may have done it this way for a reason (strength/bite stability etc).  \n\nGo to another dentist for an opinion while your dentist is on holiday. This should not cost much and will give you more information when you do see your dentist.   The second opinion should be able to let you know what's possible given your particular situation.    It would be ideal to see a restorative specialist of prosthodontist but that may cost a little more.  If you feel comfortable otherwise then you might get used to it.  What does your fiance think?"

Then he said he could put two white fillings between the teeth to close the gap at a cost,  I went ahead with it.  Teeth looked okay for a couple of years then I experienced pain on the left teeth,  I went to him again and he basically said well you're gonna loose the tooth as a abcess is there,   he the gave me very expensive options that I could noway afford,  and I just started crying my eyes out,  he then said he could probably save it by having root canal and a crown and it wouldn't be as expensive,  so the never next day he performed the root canal.  He said I had gum disease and having some bone loss making me feel really crappy and unhygienic,   again trying to give me expensive options like implants.   After I had it done the tooth hasn't felt right and slightly loose and the gap getting bigger,  but I've just got on with it being careful as I don't wanna see that dentist again,  as I felt he just wanted money.  (He tried telling my daughter she had a abcess and wanted to do root canal the next day,  I said no I'm getting a second opinion and he got shitty,  low and behold another dentist said there was nothing wrong with her tooth,  just a bit of inflammation)  \nLast week my top part of my gums swelled really bad,  I managed on pain relief and anti inflammatory tablets.  The tooth now has became extremely loose now and its gonna probably fall out and the other front tooth isn't looking too great now and fear it will end up like the other one.   I know my gums are not in the best heath, and due to a medical problem I was constantly being sick for 8yrs and believe this has caused some decay too.   I do brush regularly,  and use expensive toothpaste and mouth washes,  ive also suffered ulcers on my gums due to stress and that hasn't helped.  \nI have emailed a new dentist in the area,  I'm just really nervous they are going to judge me and I'm going to look awful toothless,  I'm also renewing my vows next year.   Has anyone lost their front teeth?  And what options did you choose?   \n\nSorry for the long post thanks for reading Busybee: I'm so sorry you're going through this, so distressing as you are still so young.  Front teeth are so important to your self esteem.   It's possible this is down to your gum disease.     Gum disease can be hereditary so even if you take really good care of your teeth you won't stop it progressing.  Only regular periodontist  appointments can help.       It may be that the gap was forming all along because your gum problems.    If you have photos or x rays you could post then the dentists here can have a look and assess your situation.

I feel let down by the two previous dentists as I've put my trust in them.   I'm hoping 3rd time lucky and they can sort something out.  I'm here in the uk and I know only certain bands let you have NHS treatment,  anything cosmetic costs a absolute fortune.

It's great news that your daughter was caught early and is having some success.   Maybe they can save that tooth if they treat the gums.   I think they don't look too bad.  It's the gums that need to be brought back to health before anything else.   See a specialist."

Now in addition to all these symptoms i started to experience excessive pressure caused by the upper jaw on the lower jaw specially when sleeping causing difficulty in sleeping, so i currently visited two other dentists who both said that such a badbite can be occur because of a certain pressure caused by the upper wisdom teeth on the other upper teeth which caused them slowly to move forward over time so i should remove the upper wisdom teeth.

But hopefully a dentist will answer your query and give you the technical response.  Bear in mind that all dentists have their own preferences on such treatment.  The composite would be favoured by a conservative dentist because it removes less tooth and that's considered better for the long term health of the tooth.   In my case it worked but it really depends on the skill of the dentist because composite as I understand it is not always easy to work with."

Is it really a sign of mouth cancer (since it appears at both sides whereas only the lower left wisdom tooth hurts)? MattKW: It's nothing like cancer. It's a common condition technically called, \"linea alba\", or white line. It's simply where your teeth meet and is of no concern. It's more obvious in some people than others.

It’s been like this ever since my adult teeth came, so about 8-10 years ago. Is this enough to get braces? If not, how do I solve this? KVMCruces: I have that EXACT same problem - mine is just slightly less noticeable.\nI'm sure if you were to go see an orthodontist they could assist you with getting that straightened out or direct you to other options. My advice though is if you're directed toward getting cosmetic work, I wouldn't do it. Sure its a little crooked but its really not that big of a deal. Preserving your natural teeth is better for you in the long run. Once you get the work started it never really stops (My husband is a retired DDS and I am a CDT, you'd be surprised at how many of the same patients keep coming back to get other work done. It starts off with a single crown, then its veneers, then its a bridge, etc etc etc...) MattKW: Personal choice, but if your upper teeth are well aligned, then leave this alone. You'd have to go through a lot of ortho treatment to fix it, and then have to maintain for the rest of your life. It's not as easy as some people thiunk."

    "dialogue": "Alexandria Chiesa: On Thursday I went into my dentist for a broken tooth that supposedly just needed a crown. By the time I left they told me they opened the tooth to the nerve and i would now need a root canal I would have to get at another office. In the mean time they said they put medicine on the nerve to kill it and put a temporary crown on. 5 hours later the numbing meds wore off and I was in the most excruciating pain of my life. The work site looked healthy in my mouth but the pain was unimaginable. I called my dentist and they said there wasn't any reason this should be happening but that they would call in antibiotics and tylenol 3s anyways. They could try to get me back in next week. I just scheduled the root canal with a different office for this coming Wednesday instead. Fast forward to today, 48 hours after this mess began. The tissue around the site is now an open ulcer and the skin is coming off and the pain is really bad. I have pictures attached of the day of the procedure (with the black circle around the work site) and the picture of this morning shows the tissue damage that was not there until this morning. Can someone tell me what the heck is going on? Or if this is an emergent situation? My pain tolerance is very high but at this point I'm thinking maybe I'm allergic to something in the crown maybe? Someone please help! Busybee: That looks pretty bad.  You should go to an emergency dentist and see what they can do.   Do you have a fever? Alexandria Chiesa: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThat looks pretty bad.  You should go to an emergency dentist and see what they can do.   Do you have a fever? No fever no swelling. The pain is a burning pain Busybee: With an allergy you'd have whole-body symptoms.   If it were me I'd see an emergency dentist, because you don't know what medicine they put on the nerve to kill it.   Perhaps you could ask them what they have put on the tooth as it may be a clue as to why your gum is ulcerating.   I didn't even know that dentists put stuff on a tooth to try to kill a nerve, but I'm sure one of the dentists will explain the logic. Alexandria Chiesa: I hadn't ever heard of it being done before. I was told after the fact. And since when are temporary crowns porcelain? Pretty sure they put the permanent one they planned had made at the lab and charged me $1000 for. This whole thing is just suspicious and seems bizarre Busybee: Temp crowns aren't porcelain unless they put it on with temp cement.    You don't have permanent crowns on before a root treatment is complete.  You wouldn't make a permanent crown before the tooth is ready for it to be fitted.  It doesn't sound normal and I'd see another dentist as soon as possible to assess the condition of the dental work."

I am not sure they have a test that's approved for the mouth and throat, but I'm not sure why it would be hugely different given it's a mucous membrane.  There is a vaccination which you can always have if you are worried.

Our daughter has got yellow and white spots, roughness to the touch and major discoloration to one front upper tooth. There us also marked discolouration to other teeth in the mouth. Our 7 year old son is now presenting similar promblems. We are not sure if its too much or to little fluoride intake. Or maybe something completely different. We would be grateful for any assistance anyone could offer. BeenThere: \"fluoride intake\"  \"brushing etc\"  -- ah, what would be \"etc\"?\n\nI hope you realize that fluoride is a toxic substance (a waste product of the aluminum industry very costly to dispose of unless donated for municipal water supplies), to be used sparingly (if at all).  The margin between effective level and toxic level in the water supply is quite narrow (very easy to overdo it leading to tooth mottling, or, underdo it and get little benefit).\n\nMy family and I have never knowingly used fluoride, outside the nominal amounts in toothpaste).  If you must use it I urge avoid swallowing it.   Excessive fluoride use on teeth will cause 'mottling' of tooth surfaces.  Even regions with merely fluoridated water may have residents coping with this symptom (if you're in such an area and are also using fluoride coatings, that may be overkill).  True, fluoridation does have a modestly positive cavity prevention impact (especially for residents neglectful of regimental dental hygiene imo). MattKW: Tayla2130 said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHi,\nWe are in desperate need of some assistance with the care of our childrens teeth... . First photo is an isolated mottled area on incisor - a hypoplasia, most probably due to fluoridation. It might be a bit unattractive, but that can be easily remedied with maybe some enamel microabrasion for the darker part, and if necessary follow with a shallow composite filling. Second photo a bit harder to see - don't forget that adult teeth are naturally yellow anyway. Also, if the child isn't too concerned, then don't make too much fuss about it. The time to take action is if the child expresses concern, or they start getting teased. Talk to other parents, and you'll find there's a lot of variation. I've had an 8 year-old ask me once about bleaching - and she had perfectly normal teeth. Please ignore BeenThere's scaremongering."

    "dialogue": "SugarFiend: Can having long term mercury feelings eventually lead to a tooth to crack?\n\nIf so why didn't my dentist tell me that or work on a porcelain crown before crack had happened? MattKW: No. There are a few reasons behind this myth:\n\nOriginal amalgams contained some Zinc which gave it better working properties, and this did lead to some expansion. Zinc was removed many years ago.\nOriginal guidelines for preparing teeth were very mechanistic, and did not understand that sharp line angle would initiate cracks. Again, no longer taught.\nAmalgams do not glue to teeth; composite fillings are meant to glue to enamel and dentine and therefore restrengthen teeth. Except under ideal conditions, this is not as effective as once thought, but it makes a great selling point.\nAny large cavity filled with any material is more likely to fracture. Such teeth should be crowned or onlayed before a fracture occurs. It's not necessarily the fault of the filling if your tooth fractures, its the weakness caused by the removal of tooth when cleaning out the decay.\nSome patients don't want to do crowns and take their chances\nSome cracks are simply unpredictable. An undamaged tooth or even a small cavity will sometimes develop cracks. Dentistry is not an exact science. Busybee: I once cracked an amalgam filled tooth crunching hard-boiled sweets.  It was totally my fault.   The fillings were done pretty well and that was after years of wear and tear.  It was saved with a composite which sealed the crack. It's nothing to do with the material but down to the preparation what you subject the tooth to, the bite and how strong the remaining tooth is.  If every dentist crowned decayed teeth patients would complain far more because crowns form a bigger risk of root failure etc.  I just looked up zinc and it seems they stopped using it in the early 60s. MattKW: Composites don't seal cracks, except superficially. The bonding is much too weak to be effective. The solution for a crack is to reduce the weakened part of tooth, then cover over with a filling (any type - amalg or composite), onlay, or crown.\nCrowns do not create bigger risk of root fracture in most cases (e.g. molars); absolute tosh. They can be a risk in small teeth like lateral incisors or 1st premolars. The added risk from crowns is usually further indirect damage to the pulp, therefore ~8% risk of nerve dying. But the tooth has already been seriously worked on before you get to needing crown, so sometimes must weigh up risks/benefits in decision-making. Busybee: I didn't mean that crowns create fractures in roots, but that crowns can put a tooth at greater risk of the nerve dying because of the amount of tooth you have to remove.   Crowns are also more likely to need replacing faster when the margin goes etc.  whereas some people have the same fillings all their lives.  Crowns also need greater attention to hygiene. \n\nI'm just telling it as the dentist explained it to me ref the composite.  Whatever he did, it was very successful because another dentist sent me to an endo who was quite happy to do a root canal, but the composite was the result of a second opinion.  I have found that every dentist has a different approach, which is why I think everyone should get at least two opinions when considering any major dental work.

Such teeth should be crowned or onlayed before a fracture occurs. It's not necessarily the fault of the filling if your tooth fractures, its the weakness caused by the removal of tooth when clean\nJust wondering why my dentist never mentioned this to me.  Based on what you have said, it's standard practice to do the crown or onlay in large cavity filled teeth at risk of fracturing? MattKW: If you didn't mean that \"crowns create fractures\", then don't write it. Also, don't also take my stats re pulp deaths and pretend that's what you meant; that's misrepresentation. The next 2 sentences are also vague without supporting evidence. \nComposites and cracks  - just repeating what someone told you (which happens to be incorrect) doesn't mean you have the knowledge or experience to give other people advice on the topic in this sort of forum. Your opinions are largely anecdotal and sometimes misleading. Keep to general advice about dental health and you'll be fine.\nI only agree with your final statement that 2nd or 3rd opinions are useful for major work. MattKW: SugarFiend said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tJust wondering why my dentist never mentioned this to me.  Based on what you have said, it's standard practice to do the crown or onlay in large cavity filled teeth at risk of fracturing? It's because it is impossible to know when a tooth is likely to fracture, there's just some general \"rule of thumbs\" that we follow. Last week, I had a fellow with a perfect tooth (never filled) that inexplicably cracked and had to be extracted. He'd been to a dentist, 2 doctors, the hospital (CT scans), started various drugs for \"neuralgia\", and was finally referred to me for an opinion before heading towards neurologist. Even then I wasn't 100% confident until I called him the following day; I was sweating overnight ( and probably so was he!). Every procedure, including crowns, carries risks that are not easily assessed like measuring a tyre pressure for your car. All health professionals face the same issues e.g.medical treatment and drugs have side-effects. All we can do is watch the research for guidance, and throw in a bit of experience. Busybee: Excuse me, but where did I say \"crowns create fractures\"?  When I said root failure I meant a root requiring a root canal not a fracture, otherwise I'd have said \"root fracture\".  No need to respond aggressively or to be patronising.  I was just repeating something a dentist told me which happens to have worked.  You frequently give the same advice I do after I have given it so it seems you agree with me most of the time!

    "dialogue": "davidm7777: This all started roughly 6 months ago, when I transfer to new different dentist, who made some fillings on tooth #3 (1st molar).\n\nEver since then, every time I bit on that tooth (in a particular area), there's this intense, sharp pain.\n\nI went back to my dentist several times for adjustments to the filling and my bite. He never suspected that the tooth was cracked because it wasn't sensitive to temperatures and he could not detect any signs of cracked tooth with his tools.\n\nNo progress was ever made with the adjustments, so we decided to prep the tooth for a temporary crown and then permanently install a zirconia crown. I had the temporary crown for roughly 3-4 weeks and, while the pain was not as sharp, I could still feel the pain when biting. The best way I can describe it is that it was like putting a cap on a bruise and pressing against it (the pain was distributed). Having described these symptoms, my doctor decided to use a weaker adhesive to attach the perm crown, so that it can easily taken off later for a root canal treatment if necessary.\n\nSo it's been a week since the perm was installed and while it did improve things, I could still feel pain when chewing certain foods. I also developed major sensitivity to hot/cold temperature in that tooth. I suspect that the weaker adhesive did not fully bond the crown to my tooth and perhaps some of the dentine is being exposed. I also wear my mouth guard every night. When I put it on, I don't feel any pain or pressure, but, my teeth feels kind of sore (not just the crowned tooth) in the mornings.\n\nThis tooth is making me depressed. I have not been able to eat normally on my right side for almost a year now. I've spent a ton of money on visits, but they make no difference in the end. My dentist does not seem incompetent, but maybe he's overlooking something? Is the underlying pulp inflamed? Should I get a second opinion? I'm currently wearing my crown with a weak adhesive."

MattKW: If you lose a root, then crowning is rarely possible - never had the opportunity in my life for such a case.

Using a sensitive toothpaste may help to seal tubules that are exposed.  But soda drinks are the worst thing as is fruit juice - cut them out completely.  Some foods are worse than others.  Avoid cakes and biscuits & dried fruit & also potato chips.   It's the type of food too, because it's the sort of foods that stick to teeth that will harm the enamel.    Citrus fruits are not good either and I think even berries aren't great.  \n\nThere's a fashion for raw food but I reckon it's not great for weakened teeth.   IMO the best thing to do is not to snack between meals.  Have a routine and just drink water in between.  \n\nIf you do eat sugar try to limit it to just once a day and over a short period.   The worst thing is grazing for hours.  Having a treat once a day (after you have cleaned your teeth) isn't so bad.  Just make sure you wait half an hour after eating before you brush again (as acid attacks soften the enamel and you can damage more by brushing straight after), maybe rinse with water to get rid of any acid.  Flossing is ok though at any time.  Once you stop sugar and soda you find that you stop craving them.   Soda is the funniest thing, totally man-made.  But so addictive.   It's really best if you try to cut it and sugar out.   If you must have soda or juice drink through a straw and try not to get it on you teeth."

    "dialogue": "PanzerMan: I could feel an irregularity on my tooth like a cavity and my dentist kept telling me nothing was there after miltiple visits.  The tooth is now sensitive to everything so I switched dentists and the new dentist had no doubt there was an issue and cavity on the tooth, in fact he said he's unsure if he could save the tooth even with a root canal now because of its location and length of time it was allowed to progress...\n\nWould a dentist purposely let a simple filling turn into a big issue like I have now on purpose for financial gain? As in my insurance would pay a small amount for the filling or alot for an extraction.  \n\nWhat other reason would he pretend he doesnt see anything wrong for? He had to of have known especially with me pointing it out literally... MattKW: Did the new dentist show you the decay on the X-ray, or are you just taking his word? We don't want to miss problems - it doesn't work out financially in the long term if the patient doesn't recommend us to other people. Lily: In the United States I wouldn't doubt it but in Western Europe, no.  Dentists in Western Euorpe are ethical.  The culture is intellectual not narcissistic or profit driven. regardless of whether Trump received the majority vote he is a narcissist and he was Tolerated where he would be laughed at in Western Europe and told to Gtfo! dentists in the Western EU and EE are really helpful not pathological.. a new study suggests 70 percent of American millenials are narcissists. So it probably means about 50 percent of older generations are too. IN Eastern Europe where I had to work for a few years they are completely incompetent and so it is stupidity not intent to harm.  I would prefer stupidity over maliciousness but either way it costs and I am very angry about the stupidity of the dentists I have dealt with both in the US and in Eastern Europe. The only awesome dentist I had was in New York and he was newly arrived from Egypt:  dedicated and wonderful.  I am starting to clench my teeth thinking about them so ciao. MattKW: Lily said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIn the United States I wouldn't doubt it but in Western Europe, no.  Dentists in Western EuoBit of a rant. There are good and bad dentists everywhere. The educational standards and economies of some countries are a factor in the *average* quality of dentistry. Recently saw my son's fiance from West Germany and the quality was so poor for that particular dentist that I redid the work myself - what a great holiday she had here (Australia)! Lily: No, I am entitled to my opinion regardless of the chord I strike within you. And as an Australian I am surprised you feel comfortable challenging the German health care system which is much more impressive.  Australians remind me a lot of Americans from the Midwest and West (not international New Yorkers.) I was not impressed with the country. New Zealand on the other hand was mind blowingly beautiful and the people were so down to earth and intelligent and enlightened about conservation .  And I'm certainly not German lol! but I am in touch with reality and give credit where credit is due.  I don't pay any mind to American and other similar countries' narcissistic doctors whose ego and hubris don't match their skill and hence repel. The most brilliant doctors, diagnosticians I have met have been in some of  the poorest countries, they have no ego and yet are truly brilliant.  They are not in it for the money or prestige, it is their passion. This has been my experience travelling the world.  I met the most brilliant doctors in Turkey and Ecuador.  Both relatively poor countries but with medical talent that is mind blowing. I wish first world doctors and dentists in Australia,  the United States and UK would see their brilliance and be humbled. I also met brilliant doctors in the Eu and EE  none with hubris the same as in Ecuador and Turkey but they had more advanced technology afforded them.

    "dialogue": "Lokesh: Hello,\n\nWhen I was a kid, I fell and hurt my lateral incisor. I got it checked recently and I was advised to get an RCT done. After RCT, doctor suggested that they would draw blood and grow tissue from it in the lab and reintroduce it into the tooth with RCT.\n\nEvery other doctor has asked me to get a crown placed. What should I do?\n\nThe 'regrown tissue' procedure sounds close to keeping the tooth 'natural'.\n\nPlease suggest. Busybee: I've never heard of such a thing.  There is a an experimental treatment to regrow dentine with a biomaterial (s Harvard and Nottingham universities research study).  This treatment is not available to the public yet.  But you have already had the nerve removed and this is experimental work your dentist is suggesting.  You need to give signed consent if he is carrying out research & using you as a guinea pig.  The study I mention used stem cells from embryos.  What your dentist suggests sounds dangerous and you could end up losing the tooth altogether and getting quite ill if it goes wrong.    Which country are you in? MattKW: I have heard of some technique where the dying tooth can be revascularised, but there's no way of revascularising after you've had an RCT; fairy tale stuff. As for a crown, lateral incisors must be approached with care, as they are quite small teeth, and a crown doesn't always offer an advantage. If you haven't had cavities on the sides of the lateral incisor which would weaken it, I probably wouldn't suggest a crown. Sometimes I don't even do RCTs for lateral incisors, and prefer to extract them - there are sometimes alternatives like implants, cantilever bridges from the adjacent canine, or even cantilever Maryland bridges. And I'd also be interested which country you're in. Busybee: Matt I'm horrified to read you'd remove a lateral rather than crown it!

But that's because you don't have experience in the particulars of trying to save compromised teeth. It's akin to trying to save a written off car in some circumstances. Crowns cannot save some teeth, they will actually weaken them - lateral incisors and 1st premolars rare the most risky. Patients don't appreciate it if they've spent a lot of money, time, and discomfort, for an RCT and crown that fails within 2-3 years.

I have my own extensive experience of a crown on a lateral compromised tooth.  One that has been that way for decades now and I am very much invested in keeping it in situ.   It's stronger with a crown & rct than it was before.   It would cost me far more in money & trauma to have a bridge or attempt an implant.  It's the most sensible option financially and psychologically  to try to save such a tooth with a crown and rct.   It's definitely worth trying. MattKW: Yes, you have your own individual circumstances that have worked well, and i'm happy for you. It doesn't always work that way, and unless you have unlimited funds, then budgetary concerns and longevity are factors to be considered for any type of treatment."

    "title": "Severe pain and swelling",
    "dialogue": "Tammy T: Several weeks ago I has to find a new dentist because my previous one had retired and I had lost a crown on a front tooth. I went to a dental office recommended by a co-worker although I was not seeing the same dentist she uses. I'm pretty dental phobic, but I really liked him at the first visit and he put me at ease. He said he would have to refer me to a 22nd 22nd but I did need three fillings and two extractions. He did the fillings first and all went well.  I went back a week later for the extractions. The first was very quick and easy but the second was my left upper wisdom tooth. He was chatting and told me that a lot of oral surgeons didn't like him pulling wisdom teeth, but it's really easy to pull the top ones so he does them to save his patients money, but he doesn't do the bottom ones. He tried for quite a while to pull the wisdom tooth and said there was just so little room he was having trouble. At one point he took a break and said he'd give it another 10 minutes but if he didn't get it he would give up. I was not in pain, just uncomfortable from having my jaw open so wide. He was unable to remove the tooth and handed me contact information for an oral surgeon. He told me the tooth was likely to get infected from the manipulation so to see him \"sooner rather than later\". That night when the numbing wore off I was in a lot of pain. His instructions said to take 800 mg of ibuprofen every four hours so I did, but over the next few days I got worse instead of better. More pain, more swelling, and I developed swelling and significant pain and swelling up in my left temple area as well. On the fourth day as things were still worsening I called him and he ordered amoxicillin and a steroid pack. The pain and swelling in my cheek area subsided but the temple pain and swelling continued and did not improve. I was concerned it was a deep infection so since I work for a doctor I asked him for an opinion. He examined the swelling and said it did not appear to be an abscess or infection but felt like a muscle. I felt better and assumed my jaw was sprained from the stress of the failed extraction and that it would improve with time so I continued the ibuprofen, applied heat, and although it was very tender tried to massage the area, but it kept getting worse . I could only open my mouth very slightly and eating was almost impossible. Two weeks after the procedure and with my oral surgeon appointment still almost a week away I called him when the antibiotic  and steroids were gone, my temple pain and swelling continually worsened and I once again began to develop pain and swelling in my cheek as well. He said there was an infection and I needed a different antibiotic. When he did not examine or explain the very obvious swelling in my temple I asked him about it. I told him that the doctor I worked with had said the swelling was a muscle. I also expressed concern over taking 3200 mg of ibuprofen daily for over two weeks because otherwise i could not function due to tge pain and that i was also unable to eat. He shrugged on his way out the door and said that it was just because the wisdom tooth was inflamed and needed to come out. I am a nurse and I understand that things sometime happen and while I had been concerned I was really not angry until his attitude was so dismissive. His assistant told me as she walked me out to alternate the ibuprofen with \"Motrin and Advil\". I said you do know those are brand names for ibuprofen right? I have been taking the antibiotic but the swelling us  increasing and now extends from mid forehead area to my cheekbone and from my hairline to my eyelid. The small amount I am able to open my mouth does not open straight but pulls my lower jaw to the left. Chewing is impossible and sleeping is nearly so. I see the oral surgeon  in two days but do not know how he Will be able to examine me let alone extract the tooth. I am very frightened that I have a torn ligament of some other major injury to the temporalis muscle. Sorry this is so long, I just don't know where to turn. I am concerned the oral surgeon may not be forthright because he would not want to implicate a referral source had perhaps been negligent. Ideas? Thoughts? Suggestions? Thank you for any help. Busybee: That sounds awful Tammy.  I'm so sorry for the terrible ordeal you have had.  I am sure the oral surgeon would not lie about the situation if he is professional.   He should be able to numb you sufficiently to examine and extract the tooth.   Please let us know how you get on."

    "dialogue": "Helesea: Hello, I would like to check if my dentist's advice is correct. I had my last dental check up 5 months ago and all seemed good. I never had any fillings and the only work i have ever done on my teeth was the removal of my left bottom wisdom tooth. \n\nYesrerday i felt something on my left top wisdom tooth and i tried to remove it with my finger. The same night i attempted to brush it really hard and then I fel with my tongue a hole between my wisdom tooth and my gum. Lately that area has been feeling a bit weird but i didnt have any pain. Since last night I can feel a slight pain,  but i am not sure if its just me being more aware of it.\n\nI went to the dentist today and she confirmed that the wisdom tooth was brown and had a hole and said that she will make a referal to the hospital for removal. She said though that it can take up to three months for a removal appointment and if there is any pain in the meantime to go back.\n\nShe just had a quick look at it and sodnt have an xray to check how deep the hole is, as i expected. She said that this back in the mouth, its difficult to get an xray. \n\nI am now worried that I have to stay with a hole in my mouth and a rotten tooth for so long. I am worried that it may get infected and especially if it affects my gums or my nerves. Has anyone been told that It is ok to wait for 3 months for a rotten tooth removal?\n\nAnyone has any advice on how to avoid infection in these three months? I asked the dentist if i should get an antiseptic mouthwash and she said that there is no scientific evidence that mouthwash works. Basically she told me to do nothing but wait. \n\nNext, I asked the dentist why the decay was not picked in the last check up. She said that a lot can happen in 5 months... is that right?\n\nAny advice from anyone in a similar situation would be very helpful.\n\nThanks Busybee: I am not a dentist but if it's not hurting you and you don't feel unwell then it can wait.  The dentist told you that if anything changes contact them.  So if you are in pain now go back. MattKW: Upper wisdom teeth often decay on the outside surface where it's hard to clean. Usually it's an easy extraction. I don't see any harm waiting 3 months unless you get pain."

If you were in pain before the filling, then maybe the nerve isn't recovering. If it was a deep filling, then maybe the nerve isn't recovering.

Looking for professional dentist input if possible.\n\nI've been researching for my own use what exactly causes malocclusion in humans after reading about Dr. Weston A Price and his research on primitive tribes. Peoples eating a traditional diet apparently had less instances of decay and crowding compared to those eating a modern diet.\n\nAlong the way I stumbled upon orthotropics which touts the importance of keeping your tongue, lips, and teeth in the proper position growing up to avoid problems later on in life. From what I gleamed, having a bad oral posture is primarily responsible for dental crowding.\n\nI don't know how legitimate this is in modern circles which is why I'm asking. For reference, I read this article which cites studies performed on monkeys but not humans. \n\nFrom my understanding this works on children but not adults correct? Or it does for adults too but it's unlikely? Basically trying to figure out whether this stuff is a sham or not. Thanks in advance. MattKW: Quick Google search and a couple of articles. IMHO, doesn't seem anything remarkable, and may work for some specific cases, but certainly not a cure-all. Most good orthodontist indiviualise treatment anyway and don't simply use braces."

But keep in mind, I just had a general check-up about a year ago and more scans about 6-9 months ago(part of scanning my wisdom teeth). I got the general checkup at my old dentist(pretty trustworthy and reliable). He did not state any emerging or already their cavities. A few months later, I went to Western Dental to scan wisdom teeth and still no cavity issues. \n\nBut today, at the new dentist place, after getting my checkup, the dentist said I apparently have 7 cavities that I need to fill?! I find this very hard to believe. I admit I kind of rush on brushing my teeth sometimes but I have a habit of brushing my teeth 3x a day. Plus, last year, I had no new cavities and this year I have 7 new cavities that all need fillings?! I just really can't believe this because my brushing habits have stayed the same, I don't eat a lot of candy on a daily basis(only on special occasions), and I generally eat pretty nutritious food. \n\nIt's just very hard to accept that somehow last year I had 0 cavities and a couple months later, I have 7???

I’ve been brushing twice a day and flossing more thoroughly since then. All my teeth are fine , except for one spot 4th top right that bleeds every time I floss it for the past 3 or so weeks . I try to do it very gently and it still bleeds. Now I’ve noticed it can bleed for no reason, even after not eating anything and get a metallic taste in my mouth from time to time . There isn’t really any pain, maybe a little swelling from what I can see. Im a bit concerned if it’s something serious? Dlo: I just had this issue also and found this post looking for answers the other day. I know your post was over 6 months ago but I wanted to share my findings so others searching might find it.\n\nOne day I noticed some pain in my gums while eating. Almost a soreness. I had recently been to the dentist also. I flossed and brushed twice a day but it continued to get worse, bleeding when I flossed and to the point of bleeding on its own. It progressively went from irritation to more serious pain.\n\nThis went on for almost two weeks. Today the pain was so bad it radiated into my jaw. The spot was throbbing and hurting badly. I've been flossing after every meal to keep that spot clean, so after lunch I grabbed a new roll of floss. This floss happens to be much thicker than what I'd been using.  I flossed the spot and I felt something moving and lots blood came out. It stank so bad. I pull the floss out and there is a popcorn husk. Immediately the pressure and pain improved. It's like when your ears pop and you get relief suddenly.\n\nApparently it was jammed in there in a pocket and the floss I normally use didn't dislodge it. I never even knew it was there.  But sure enough I remember eating popcorn a few weeks ago, a lot of it. The new floss was a thick waxy ribbon type that really did the trick.\n\nIt has improved so much it's almost like it never happened, just in 12 hours.  Still alittle tender but no real pain. I got an antibiotic to be safe because it was undoubtedly infected. \n\nThis same thing actually happened to me years ago, but the husk came out like the first time I flossed, before it progressed  from soreness. \n\nSo if you have this problem maybe you have something stuck in a pocket.

I eat popcorn everyday and figured the taste was related to a popcorn kernel stuck in my gums and decaying. The taste is very uncomfortable and I am worried about the long term implications decaying food could have on my dental health. I visited my dentist last week and he confirmed my suspicions that the source of the problem was a popcorn kernel stuck in my gum. He removed the kernel and assured me that my body would eventually \"take care of it\" if I hadn't taken action on my own and that I shouldn't be worried about it. While he was removing the food, he commented that the kernel had broken into several pieces. \n\nIt has been about a week since my visit and the taste has persisted, although not as strong. I suspect that he removed some, but not all, of the kernel. I have tried to floss and brush the problem away but I believe it is not accessible by those means, especially since I have been regularly brushing and flossing the entire time this has been bothering me. Is it true that my body will naturally \"take care\" of the food still stuck in my gums? If so, how long does that take? The taste is very uncomfortable. In addition, is it true that I shouldn't be concerned about the long-term implications of decaying food stuck in my gums? That seems counter-intuitive to me. I am considering seeing a second dentist to get a second opinion and hopefully remove the rest of the kernel, but I do not want to pay for a visit if the problem will work itself out soon. \n\nI would be infinitely grateful to any professional advice regarding this problem!"

The treatment proposed was more than $7000, it included crowns and bridges and not sure what else.  The problem is that she has had to go on average at least once a month because something broke or she has pain, they would \"fix\" it and she would be fine for sometime but then something else happens.  My mom is frustrated and so am I, my wife suggested that my mom requests her records and my father in law a retired dentist would take a look at them.  \nI took my mother and asked the receptionist about the process of requesting records and she said it can't be done only if another dentist asks for them.  I told her per HIPPA regulations she has the right to get her records, she said it was office policy and she would have to call a supervisor to ask about it, we left because I wanted to reasearch more.  I talked to my wife and she mentioned how even in their website it says patients have the right to their records, she sent me the information on texts and HIPPA regs as well.  I sent them an email saying my mother wanted to request her records and per HIPPA and their website she could do so by filling out a form and to confirm that since the receptionist had said it couldn't be done.  They replied confirming a form wad only needed but saying I misunderstood, we went back filled out the form and they said the records would be ready in 15 days so we left.  She had an appt a few days later because she had pain from a crown she did, she showed up and she wad told they could not see her anymore because she had filled out the form to see another dentist, when in fact she never said that.  She was also told about lawyers and how she should not involve people when it was her decision.  Basically they intimidated her, I went back in with my mother and asked if in fact she wad being denied being seen because she requested her records.  The receptionist immediately changed her tune and said my wife had canceled the appt. Which was false.\nI told them I would report them to the BBB  and the dental association.  I sent them an email as well, the never apologized or offer any resolution instead played the victim saying I was harrasong them.\nWe suspect they did something shady and will not want to give my mom her records we know they have to provide written justification as to any denial, so we'll see what they do.\nIn the meantime my mom still has pain and we have to look for another dentist.\nDoes my mom have any legal recourse on this?  Should we report them for bad customer service or trying to deny her records?  We think there is some kind of negligence since she's had to go back so many times and now they denied service.  Should we contact a lawyer or wait for the records and then contact one?  Thanks for any advice. Busybee: It sounds like something is not right.  Have you managed to obtain the records now?  If not ask your new dentist to request them and perhaps seek his/her support for legal action if the work is negligent.   You should be entitled to your records but I don't know the law where you are because I'm in another country. Ernesto Barrera: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIt sounds like something is not right.

    "title": "Crown issue",
    "dialogue": "Cassandane: Hi All,\n\nI had a large cavity on my UPPER RIGHT MOLAR back in 2014 which was treated with a filling. Filling is huge (pic attached). After the procedure as the weeks passed I noticed a jolt when i bite. It feels like biting on aluminum. Its like an electric shock. It only happens when i bite on hard objects like almonds etc .. the dentist said to give it time and see if it gets better. It never did. He did a bite test on me every time I came in to complain and I think he tried to file it down or something. Not sure what he tried to accomplish. I moved away and lived with it. The jolt only came on hard foods and it wasnt super bothersome. It still isnt bothersome. I can live with it if I have to. These days I can chew on it better than I did in the past.\n\nFast forward now 2018 the jolt now surfaces when I eat acidic foods (lemon, lime etc.) I saw 3 dentists for 3 different opinions. They did a bite test and concluded that their may be a fracture or brokeness on one of the cusps. They cannot prove it but when they put pressue at a certain angle with the hard tool they use for the bite test I raise my hand when I feel the jolt. If the tooth is really fractured on one of the cusps how is that possible since I felt the jolt right after the filling was done years ago. Theres no way I fractured it right after the filling. \n\nAll 3 dentists suggested a crown. They said the crown should solve the problem (98%) lol... and if it doesnt then a root canal is next.\n\nThe crown is gonna cost me $550 (my share) thats the exact cost as quoted by insurance. Do you think I should skip the crown and go straight to a root canal? I doubt that the nerve or root has anything wrong with it. Based on what i described about the jolt happening from hard foods and now acidic foods does it mean the issue is with the nerve or the issue is with a fracture? These days I dont notice a jolt on hard foods I notice it on acidic foods. My most recent dentist said a filling should of never been done on it, instead it should of had a crown immediately after discovering the cavity.\n\nWhy should I pay $550 now and get a crown  only to be later told I need a root canal? Please explain this whole issue to me and why a crown is suggested first. MattKW: You've got a deep composite on that tooth. As a first step, I'd suggest taking out the filling and looking at base of cavity prep - most cracks appear along base of cusp inside the tooth, and can be picked up with transillumination. Another possibility is that the composite is leaking, especially along deep back edge. After checking for crack in 1st step, if no crack found then line base of cavity with thin smear of Ledermix/corticosteroid paste for pain relief, then Dycal (CaOH) for insulation, and refill with amalgam. If the pain still continues, then consider RCT BEFORE a crown. An RCT can be done after a crown, but raises risks of difficult access/ poor visibility, and weakening of crown strength. I don't agree with crowning a tooth that is sensitive to see if that works - the pain must be resolved as first stage. Cassandane: I forgot to mention that when I got the first filling in 2013 and moved to my current city my dentist here removed the first filling and put a new one in. But the jolt continued even with the new filling. MattKW: Understood. But composites are much more likely to have post-op sensitivity than amalgams. If redoing a comp doesn't resolve the sensitivity (or if it's a huge cavity anyway), then I will change to amalgam. That usually does the trick as amalgams don't shrink/leak like composites. If changing to amalg doesn't work, then prepare for RCT, then crown. Cassandane: Your suggestion is to now do a third filling with amalgam and see if it works and if it doesnt move to a root canal?\n\nWhat if the nerve is healthy and viable though? Can Root canals be done on healthy teeth with good nerves? MattKW: If the tooth settles down with the amalgam, then you won't need an RCT, just go straight to crown after a few weeks.The only reason that RCTs get done is when the nerve isn't settling down despite all simple attempts. If you go straight to crown with cranky nerve, the extra damage is likely to aggravate it further, and then you'll end up with an RCT that'll have to go through the crown. And that's a pain to do. It's much better to do a crown on a live tooth than an RCTd tooth because you'll have a stronger foundation (the natural tooth structure) - RCTs weaken teeth. Busybee: I had a problem like this and it was a crack at the side of the tooth.  I had an amalgam filling in the tooth at the time it cracked.  The endo wanted to do a root canal & crown, but I went for a second opinion and that dentist suggested replacing the filling to seal the crack.  He used composite.  It's been successful for ten years.  So instead of killing the nerve with RCT he saved the tooth.  \n\n I had a similar problem on the other side, which was at the time also filled with amalgam.  That was fixed with a gold onlay.   Maybe it was not necessary but good gold onlays last decades.   \n\nWhat you will find is that every dentist has a different approach on how to fix this.  The trouble with a crack is that it can get worse if you don't protect it.  If it goes to the root then you need an extraction so it's important to fix sooner rather than later.    A crown can always be replaced if you need root treatment.  Yes it's a waste of money if it doesn't work out but if it does, it might be all you need.   \n\nI've recently had a porcelain crown on a molar (which is not cracked) and I do think a gold onlay is better all round particularly if there is a heavy load on it. Cassandane: My filling is white meaning its composite right? All the other fillings in my teeth are silver because I had them all done as a kid. So the problem is from the white (composite filling) as you are all saying?\n\nI just feel like theres too much uncertainty...\n\nIt could be a million reasons why the tooth has a jolty feeling:\n\n1. The tooth is cracked\n2. The crack in the tooth reached the nerve\n3. Composite is leaking\n4. Theres no crack but a problem with the nerve\n5. The filling should of been filled with amalgam instead\n6.. more reasons\n7. Etc...\n\nHow am I supposed to know why I have a jolt feeling? All the reasons I listed could be the culprit. I doubt a removing the composite and putting in amalgam will cure it. Again this is a huge filling. As you can see on the photo the parameters of the filling are from east to west on the tooth. Its pretty big no? The Dentist showed me a saturated photo of the xray which shows the filling is kinda sorta close to the nerve but not really. He said during the buildup of the crown he will be able to determine if the nerve is going to be affected and if it is then he will stop everything and suggest a root canal. Does his technique sound wise? Busybee: When I have a jolt feeling it has always been a crack. It's like an electric shock and the real shock in my experience is when you eat hot food.  I remember the agony of biting on a hot chip.  A dying nerve is constantly painful in a different way.  It doesn't react to temperature in the same way. Just hurts all the time.  You can't pinpoint the pain and it can feel as though your whole mouth is sore.  Can radiate beyond the mouth to the eye, jaw, depending on where the tooth is.   With a crack that has not gone to the root it only hurts when you bite or chew.  The clue is that it will linger after you have bitten into the food.  The pain is not only sudden but develops in the seconds after biting. Busybee: By the way a composite that's not properly sealed is a less intense pain that  hurts when you eat sugar more like a sensitive tooth pain. Cassandane: I understand. When I first got the filling a few years ago I got the jolt you described when I chewed on tough foods like nuts, maybe beef jerky, an unpopped popcorn kernel, stuff like that. The jolt would last maybe 2 seconds and go away. \n\nThese days I dont notice the jolt on hard foods as much. I have become immune to it because I have lived with it for these years that I have trained myself to use my other side of mouth to chew hard food.  But these days I notice that jolt occurs when I chew sugary gum, have acidic salad dressing anything zesty and lemony. So my fear is that the acidic jolt is bad. Then pretty soon maybe Ill start getting sensitive to hot or cold. The jolt last a couple seconds and its just an annoyance, not really the aching nerve pain you describe. I know when all the dentists did the bite test they had me bite on a tool they put under the tooth and they would put it at a certain angle touching a specific point on the tooth. It only felt jolty when then placed the tool on a specific part of the tooth which they claim may be the cusp. MattKW: Just to clarify in my experience of 35 years as a dentist: Any heavily filled tooth can crack, no matter what it is filled with. When you have pain immediately after a composite filling, then I would blame the composite sealing as a first inference. By replacing with a simple amalgam, you may take away any problem with the comp and relieve your symptoms. And then you may not need an RCT. That's how I'm looking at your history and how I would handle it, rather than jumping into a crown or RCT.  Once you start a crown prep, you are committed to a crown. I don't believe that a crack has been justified at this point - ypou have to take out the filling and look at the base of the preparation for best chance. Cassandane: I ran this idea by my dentist but he thinks the amalgam filling wont work since the \"alleged\" fracture on the cusp is too big and too detrimental. He says this upper molar is used for chewing and bears alot of stress and pressure during eating etc..so he still believes a crown would  be the better option. I noticed something else: When i floss that tooth (#3) i notice the jolt sensation only arise when i floss that tooth on the side that it is touching tooth #4. When I floss that tooth from the side that it touches tooth#2 i dont feel anything. I attached a photo showing a red line which represents floss and that is the side of the tooth at which i feel the jolt. Perhaps the fracture is on that particular cusped side and not the other side. Busybee: Did you discuss a gold onlay?  You remove less tooth that way and it does the same job, if not better.  There seems to be a lot of marketing for composite and porcelain vs gold and amalgam these days.   You generally remove less natural tooth for both gold and amalgam.   The restorations for the latter also last longer.    Dentists these days seem obsessed with composite and porcelain.   Is it cheaper I wonder? MattKW: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tDid you discuss a gold onlay?  You remove less tooth that way and it does the same job, if not better.

The restorations for the latter also last longer.    Dentists these days seem obsessed with composite and porcelain.   Is it cheaper I wonder? Gold onlays don't necessarily remove less tooth structure because it is an indirect restoration. By that I mean you have to take an impression and it means there must be no undercuts, the preparation must be flared outwards, unlike normal fillings (comp or amalg) which are direct. An indirect restoration will always have more tooth removal than a direct restoration. Not saying there's anything wrong with inlay/onlays, but there's lots of pros and cons to different ways of restoring teeth. Each case is different. MattKW: Cassandane said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI ran this idea by my dentist but he thinks the amalgam filling wont work since the \"alleged\" fracture on the cusp is too big and too detrimental...\"\nMy point is not that a crown won't work, in fact a crown is probably the best option in the long run. My issue is that your dentist is assuming it's simply a crack because or the \"bite test\" alone, and doesn't seem to consider that the composite could be the problem. As I said in last post: to find the crack, remove composite and physically LOOK for crack with transillumination. If no crack, then refill with amalgam and see if that settles pain. If THAT works, then go for crown. You will hopefully avoid need for RCT. I think too many dentists don't accept the potential shortcomings of composites when issues like this arise, and rush to judgement based on limited testing and reasoning. Busybee: Matt I meant that if you're going for a crowned option then a gold onlay would remove less tooth than a ceramic crown.   I've been told by more than one dentist that a ceramic requires slightly more tooth removal and that although gold is best patients don't like the way it looks.   From an end-user point of view, I do feel happier chomping on gold than ceramic, feels indestructible (like Jaws in James Bond).  On that tooth you'd probably see it in the smile.

I think too many dentists don't accept the potential shortcomings of composites when issues like this arise, and rush to judgement based on limited testing and reasoning. It seems very sensible to test it this way, but IMO most dentists wouldn't be patient enough to do that Matt.  Depends on temperament and approach to work of course.  Most dentists are focused problem solvers and like to find the fastest route to the solution so don't always want to try different things.  Wouldn't it also mean disturbing the nerve twice which could lead to root failure in a tricky tooth and more tortuous dental visits and injections? MattKW: It doesn't take much time to do this, and if you truly want to get to the base of the problem it's the only way to go. Otherwise you're simply treating symptoms. The tooth is already disturbed - if you go straight to a crown with all the damage that'll cause, then you're much more likely to end up with an RCT than if redo with amalg first and allow pain to subside. I don't like to think my dentistry is tortuous to that extent, and if it avoids an RCT.... Busybee: Matt  - all dentistry is tortuous for the patient!"

    "dialogue": "CMO: Greetings,\n\nThis morning I noticed a black spot on the gum tissue above my right incisor.  It is at the very top of the gum tissue - so the upper lip must be lifted to see it.  I had a dental cleaning 3 weeks ago and I recall that the hygienist had to get quite aggressive to get under the gum tissue close to where the spot is located. The gum tissue in that area looked a little mangled after the cleaning and was bleeding.  The spot is about 6 mm in diameter.\n\nI plan to call my dentist this morning, but is this something any of you have seen? Should I be concerned? CMO: I wanted to follow-up that I cannot say for sure how long this spot has been present.  I do not usually lift my upper lift to observe my gums. In other words, it may have been present before my cleaning - although I am surprised the dentist or the hygienist would not have seen it. Busybee: You should see your dentist if you are concerned.  It doesn't look normal, but I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. CMO: Thank you. Actually, looking at it in bright light, it looks like a hole.  Does this make any sense. It is painless and at the top of the gum under the nose. Busybee: You had a photo on here but I can't see it now.   You should go back to the dentist though. CMO: No did not have a photo. Plan to see the dentist as soon as I can,  There is a remote possibility it is a feature that has always been there and I never noticed.  This seems unlikely but is possible because the upper lip must be lifted to see it - something I never do. Also there is no pain.  It seems inconceivable to me that a hole could appear in one's gum without pain. Busybee: If it was there before and if it's anything to worry about then a dentist would have picked it up on physical examination. CMO: Thanks BB.  I saw my dentist today. After examining the thing, he indicated that it was an architectural feature of my mouth.  Apparently, the tissues and veins are arranged in such a way that it appears that there is a hole in my gum tissue.  It has possibly always been that way and I never noticed it.  The tyranny of hyper-vigilance! Busybee: That's great that it's nothing to worry about.  I try to avoid looking inside my mouth.   If there is anything alarming I trust a dentist to spot it!"

I had one side of my mouth cleaned (dental prophy) almost 3 weeks ago, and that side has more sensitivity than the other side (which had not been professionally cleaned for 15-20 years).  Here are my questions:\n\n1.) If tooth sensitivity is always due to exposed dentin, does this mean that many of my teeth have areas where the enamel has completely worn away or the gums have receded and the cementum has worn away - exposing the underlying dentin?\n\n2.) If a professional cleaning (i.e., scaling with manual instruments) makes sensitivity worse - what does this imply?  Does it imply that calculus was covering exposed dentin and the calculus was removed during the cleaning, or can the cleaning remove root structure in the process of calculus removal?\n\n3.) In people who develop sensitivity after professional cleaning that goes away in several weeks, what is the mechanism for the sensitivity going away? MattKW: 1. Sometimes due to gum disease, sometimes due to enamel abrasion. If gum diease, then a thorough cleaning will often lead to diminished sensitivity as gums heal.\n2. Teeth often sensitive for a few days after cleaning, esp if you haven't had one for 15-20 years. Should settle with time; can help to use sensitivity toothpaste during this time.\n3. Gums heal up, dentinal tubules block up. Avoid acidic foods/drinks that would cause the tubules to stay open!\nIf this doesn't start to settle soon, go back to dentist - I can't suggest more here without examination."

Although he has experienced no pain, nor is there any visual indication that anything is wrong with his teeth, my friend has total faith in his dentist and is understandably upset. The dentist showed him (what were ostensibly) his x-rays indicating severe decay inside all of the teeth; yet there is no sensitivity to hot or cold or sweet or anything. Can this dentist's diagnosis be correct? \n\nI question whether it is possible to have so severe a dental problem, with absolutely no symptoms. (My paranoia cautions that this elderly gentleman’s dentist may be trying to take financial advantage him.) Busybee: I don't know what the dentists will think but I reckon that if you are at the grand old age of 85 and have no symptoms then stick two fingers up at such a diagnosis and get a second opinion. suspicion: Thank you, Busybee. I agree with your suggestion, but am having difficulty in convincing my friend of the possibility that his dentist may be giving him an incorrect diagnosis. If I get any replies from dentists indicating that the diagnosis could very well be accurate, I would tend to defer to the professionals. But, I still would want him to get a second opinion.\n\nThank you for your response. Busybee: I think the dentists here would want to see some x rays or photos to give a qualified response.

Ask for copies. suspicion: Thank you, MattKW. At this point, I'm just trying to find out if it's possible that someone could be completely symptom-free and yet have such severe tooth destruction that they need to come out. The dentist is considering removal of not only the front teeth, but ALL teeth in the lower jaw(!)  Last year, my friend was unsuccessful in wearing an upper partial bridge, and has been told he would not be a good candidate for implants. He's depressed and doesn't want to talk about it and would certainly not ask the dentist to provide x-ray copies. He's angry that I am even questioning his beloved dentist's diagnosis. \n\nI intend to keep on pressing. Busybee: It's a pity Suspicion if a dentist were to advise a patient to have all their teeth out just for financial gain.   We don't know the truth without x-rays as for all we know your friend may have an infection that could affect his overall health and be a risk to him at his age.    If you cannot obtain x rays then try to persuade your friend to go for a second opinion just to make you feel better as a favour to you because you are so worried.  Perhaps offer to pay for the second opinion. MattKW: People can be without symptoms until really advanced. But I can't force people to have treatment they don't want, so sometimes just let them go their way and wait for them to return. I quite often encourage them (in writing) to look for 2nd opinions, and they can take Xrays with them. There's not a lot of fun or financial gain from extracting teeth which will potentially make them more miserable."

I was not aware that dentists normally gave any other types of injections, only the ones to make your mouth numb before working on you. My daughter seemed surprised, and I have never heard of it before. The dental assistant was in the room with her at the time and my daughter says she doesn't think anything inappropriate took place. They said it was late in the evening, nearly 8PM and the local pharmacy would be closing so there was no way to get her a prescription filled for oral antibiotics before this morning. When I asked, they said they sometimes do penicillin shots after such work, especially if the patient is in pain and running a fever from the infection. They had her bend over the chair and lower her jeans and underpants, and gave one shot in each hip. Busybee: Is this in the UK? MattKW: I don't see a problem with it, although I just keep tablets on hand for this type of situation. A shot in the bum will work faster of course, and reach higher blood levels sooner. If this dentist does a lot of after-hours work, then it would seem a good idea. It's a lot more risky to inject in the mouth with blood vessels and nerves to contend with in the course of normal dentistry than a safe place like the bum.

Thank you, this is what was explained to me today by the dental assistant who was present when her shots were given. It was an after-hours situation as they normally close at 5:30 but didn't start working on her until after that time and it was almost 8 PM when they finished up. There would have been no way to get a prescription for oral antibiotics until this morning and with a fever of 102 degrees wanted her on the penicillin immediately. Busybee: Did they really need to take her Knickers off though?   I remember having a shot in the bum once as a child, I think it was tetanus.  But they did not remove my underwear just moved it out of the way. MattKW: Tetanus shots usually given in deltoid (arm) muscle, but possible in the bum.

I remember having a shot in the bum once as a child, I think it was tetanus.  But they did not remove my underwear just moved it out of the way. I have had dozens of shots in my hips both as a child and adult, and always slipped my underpants down off my bottom when told that was where the shot was going, it just seems under the circumstances as not being any problem for me to so. I'm sure my daughter was thinking the same way, she has had quite a few shots there as well.

I asked my daughter how far she pulled her jeans and underpants down, and she said about halfway to her knees and she didn't see anything wrong with doing that, she made it clear to me that was her choice as they didn't tell her how far to take them down and she didn't see any reason to ask, she simply exposed her bottom since they had already explained that was where the shots would be going. Since she was facing the dental assistant and the dentist was standing behind her the whole time, he couldn't have seen anything other than her bare bottom. She tells me she is totally OK with that and doesn't consider her bottom as being a private area. I asked her to show me where the shots were given, the band aids they put on to cover them are halfway down on the outer side of each of her hips. Sounds OK to me and I have no further issues with it. We just didn't know that dentists could give shots in locations other than inside the mouth. Busybee: In the Uk it's unusual to give a shot there and they would put a paper sheet over the area to cover modesty.  Most dentists would avoid it as they'd probably be worried about litigation these days.   I'm sure all sorts of things happen in dental surgeries but this was a surprise!

Yes, it was a surprise but now we have learned that sometimes it's the most expedient treatment if oral antibiotics would not be available for many hours, overnight in this case.  I've personally never been given a paper sheet for modesty when being given shots in my hips, perhaps they do things differently in your country. Here you would just pull your pants and underpants down for a minute while they gave the shots. The only time they use those modesty sheets in the medical doctors offices is when all your clothes are off for an examination. The nurse nearly always weighs me on the scale completely naked, then gives me the sheet to cover myself while waiting for the doctor to come into the room. It's been that way at several different doctors I have attended over the years. I don't think a dentist would even have a modesty sheet, but don't see any reason to use one for giving a quick shot if all that's exposed is the person's bottom."

    "dialogue": "Cortney: At regular cleaning, dentist discovered small abscess on my son's 1st molar. He has a previous filling in this tooth. The dentist called in antibiotic and plans to extract in 7-10 days followed by a space filler to prevent movement. Is extraction necessary? It sometimes seems like every time we go they want to do a procedure while the kids have no pain and few cavities. I've heard complaints from other parents that this company (has multiple offices almost like retail dentistry) does unnecessary procedures. I love the dentist we see but this is my baby and he doesn't react well to any intrusion on his person and will not handle this well even fillings are rough. Is it necessary to remove a tooth like this instead of treating the abscess and seeing if it returns? Busybee: I had two baby molars extracted aged 6 due to abscess.  They put me to sleep.  I think i'd have been more traumatised if they did a root canal.  Kids are pretty resilient. MattKW: An abscessed baby tooth might settle a bit with antibiotics as an emergency measure, but the abscess will return unless the tooth is extracted. If you do nothing, then at some stage your child may develop a lot of pain, and that's not going to be a nice day for your child, for you, or the dentist. If you have an Xray, post it up here for us to see. Baby teeth are smaller than adult teeth, so it doesn't take long for the decay to get to the nerve. As soon as children can co-operate, I will get Xrays to find any small areas of decay so they can be handled early (usually ~ 4 years old). If you're not sure about the practice, take any Xrays to another dentist or paediatric dentist for a 2nd opinion."

Finally I decided it’s time to be an adult and get it over with. I had a cracked wisdom tooth and a filling that fell out 3 years ago. I was in no pain but knew it was only a matter of time. So I sucked it up and booked my appointment. I was shocked that I only needed my 4 wisdom teeth pulled and 5 fillings. I guess that may seem like a lot, but for not going for 25 years I was pleased. I just had this done yesterday morning and I’m terrified to get dry socket. I had oral conscious sedation so I don’t remember a thing that happened. I am so sore today and the pain meds really seem to help. But how long is this going to last for? And since my dentist is closed on Mondays, can you go to the ER for a dry socket if you need to? Busybee: Did they tell you why you needed your wisdom teeth out?   \n\nI used to go every seven years and I never needed much work.    I did go a lot as a child and they were always doing and redoing fillings.  I probably didn't need half of them redoing.   I'd have no symptoms and be told I needed all these fillings.  These days I have no symptoms and they tell me I don't need any work.   Even if I have symptoms I get told I don't need any work!   I'm in a frame of mind where I'd like to boycott the dentist for another seven years because the more treatment I have the more problems I end up with.  Go figure.   But my oral hygiene is perfect.  That's the most important thing.  \n\nIt takes a few days to heal.   Why do you think you have dry socket?   Is the pain getting much worse?"

    "title": "Ideas for handling toothache pain till next apointment",
    "dialogue": "Dobs Totev: Hey guys,\n\nRecently I developed a swelling near the gum on an endodontically treated tooth that has a zirconium crown on it. My first guess was that there was a problem with the root canals of the tooth but following an X-ray the tooth looks perfectly well filled with no signs of shadows on the fillings etc, where the second recomended guess from my emergency dentist was that its possible to have a vertical root fracture (VFR). Unfortunatey that doesn’t show up on an xray and I would need to do a CT Scan to confirm the diagnosis. To handle the swelling on emergency basis I was prescribed with metronidazole antibiotic which did the job. \n\nBut now it seems I have developed a constant dull pain deep inside my tooth, almost I can feel it in my jaw that at sudden moments it sharpens and hits me hard in the head and then it goes back to being dull. The pain is constant and doesn’t go away although it doesnt worsen when I chew on that side. It’s also acompanied by swollen glands on that side of my neck.\n\nMy appointment to treat this is in 2 weeks where with my dentist we will do a CT scan to see what’s happening there, and plan an appropite treatment. But for now I have been taking ibuprofen to relief the pain but I wonder is there something else I can do? I am worried of taking iburpofen everyday for 2 weeks not to damage my kidneys or something. The amount i take is 200-400mg per day and seems to do the trick to calm all my pain. \n\nIf you have any other ideas and recomendatons I would be happy to hear them. Busybee: you could try an ibuprofen-codeine combination.    As long as you don't go beyond the stated dose you should not damage anything.  The only risk with codeine is dependence if you take it for more than a week.  So you could try taking that only alternately or when you are in more pain.  200 to 400mg per day is well below the daily stated dose for ibuprofen.\n\nIf you think it may be fractured then keep pressure off the tooth by relaxing the jaw in the day and wearing a guard which is designed to have a space around it at night.  Try to avoid chewing on it, by eating a soft diet."

    "title": "This might be weird",
    "dialogue": "Momo: Over the past year or 2 years so i’ve deveopped quite an odd obsession, and that’s breath. More particularly the smell of breath, let me explain. I’ve always been obsessed with having fresh breath, i avoid any foods with garlic or onion or anything that can cause bad odour, i brush my teeth 3 times a day atleast and  floss after i eat anything. I also keep a pack of gum on me at all times. But sometimes i feel like I still have bad breath, but if i ask my friend will tell me it’s fine (this is a friend who does not care and would not lie to make my feelings better). I’ve asked my doctor and he says my oral hygiene is above average and i’m healthy orally. I read online that some people can hallucinate smells almost like they would hear voices or see things, so my question is, has a doctor ever seen a patient like this? Or is it not a hallucination and should I be checking for something deeper to know the root of the issue. Sorry if this sounds quite odd but i could not find much online and just wanted to hear some opinions Busybee: Well it's possible but less common to have food trapped in tonsils or a oesophageal motility disorder which means food doesn't go down to your stomach as fast as normal.   The type of bad breath from teeth is very distinctive and other people would wince if they smelled it.   If you have no decay and floss then that is enough.   \n\nYou can diagnose the other conditions quite easily.   In terms of motility you'd have had some symptom of food coming back up when you've eaten a big meal.  It can be diagnosed with a barium swallow.  There's not much you can do other than avoid eating too much in one go.  The breath would only smell an hour or so after eating. Your doctor can diagnose whether food is getting trapped in tonsils.    You can also have bad breath from a long-standing throat infection, but you'd already know if that was the case.\n\nSome people scrub their tongue as you can get fungus building up on it.  I find that weird and pointless but some like to do it.  I'd avoid mouthwashes.   They say that you can tell what your mouth smells like by licking the back of your hand and then sniffing it!\n\nBut if you can't pinpoint exactly where the smell is coming from then it's likely to be normal and you just have an aversion to the smell of your own mouth.   Perhaps rather than hallucinating you may have a particularly sensitive nose.   Although you would be able to smell your own body odour and that of others if that's the case."

I had pains for 4 days after the surgery, then I was better and now I have very strong pain in my upper jaw. The dentist who did the surgery says that everything went fine, but when I'm looking at the image it seems that the membrane was broken. Could anyone please tell me if the implant installation looks fine?\nAlso I had a root canal treatment on the 7th tooth (next to the implants), so the pain might be from that tooth. Now I'm wondering if it was necessary at all to have a RCT for that tooth?  Thanks a lot! MattKW: The implants look fine from the Xray (only). The 2nd molar has had an RCT started but it is not finished, so this is a possible cause of pain.The lower right 2nd molar has an unfinished RCT; the RCTs in lower left 1st and 2nd molars are questionable; upper right canine and 1st premolar also questionable, and I'd suggest you have these assessed by an endodontist for possible retreatment before you run the risk of failures and more implants. If have been going to a general dentist up till now, I'd talk to an endodontist and a prosthodontist about where your teeth are heading in the long term."

(Long story short, im having massive migraines and xrays show my roots are in my sinus cavity which is probably causing ny migraines). My question is should i get a root canal and hope that that fixes the problem and hope to not have problems later on. Or should i just fet the tooth pulled, but ill then be missing tooth #2 & #3. Busybee: Number 3 is your upper canine right?  I'd try to save it with a root canal.  It's really not easy to replace and root treatment by a good endodontist can be really successful long term.  I'd get a second opinion on the root treatment.  But if you do need it make sure someone good does it.  It's a really important tooth.  How did you lose the 2 out of interest? Busybee: by the way I'm just looking at some of my old x rays and the canine teeth do go into the sinus cavity.  I think that's pretty normal.  I think you should definitely get a second opinion.   Migraines have all sorts of causes. (NB I don't get migraines) Regunti4: #3 is the premolar on the upper right, and #2 is your molar, and #1 is your wisdom. my wisdoms are gone and I lost #2 because of bad cavity. They tried saving #3 by filling it with medicine and then filling it 3 years ago. But now all of a sudden, I get really bad tooth pain from #3 which is leading to my really bad migraines that are absolutely horrible. I’ve been living on Tylenol and ibuprofen. My wife’s a nurse practitioner so no worries on overdosing haha. I have my endodontist appointment tomorrow. Busybee: Ok where I live I think the wisdom tooth is 8 and a second premolar would be 5, the first premolar is 4 (counting from the middle on each side).  Normally you have two molars and two premolars and a wisdom.     But some people have naturally fewer teeth.   \n\nIt's possible you have pain in the number 3 because the other teeth on that side are missing and there's more pressure when you bite.   Have you considered bridgework or an implant for the missing teeth?\n\nAnyway suggest you have a root treatment rather than lose another tooth.  Let us know how it goes. Regunti4: Ahhh gotcha, then yes #3 would be my second molar as it’s the second tooth from the wisdom tooth. Sorry for the confusion. So I had the top right wisdom pulled, then lost the first molar due to cavity, and then this is the next tooth, so #3 or second molar on the top right. Busybee: Try to hang onto it.  The more teeth you lose, the more will be under pressure and could end up the same way.    Your teeth are key to not just dental health but overall health. Regunti4: Alright so update: no infection, no need for root canal, tooth is fine endodontist says. Have to go see a neurologist to probably get an MRI. Positive is I get to keep the tooth with no procedure, negative is it could be something worse. Prayers it’s nothing too bad Busybee: That's great news about your tooth.  I hope the MRI goes well & fingers crossed it's nothing.  Try not to worry about it.  I had something similar years ago and it just spontaneously resolved, but at the time I felt my head would burst & I was told it was a \"migrainous tendency\" even though I'd never had headaches before.   Could be your bite is contributing and a nightguard to relax the jaw might help.   9 times out of ten it's just a passing thing.   Please let us know how it goes.\n\nBy the way I am really pleased you had a good & honest endo.   They are not all like that in my experience. Regunti4: Yeah, they were bad like this before in high school and then just went away and would come randomly but not bad. But lately it’s been about 2-3 weeks. Really hoping it’s a passing thing and going to get a night guard now. Busybee: Chances are that it will pass.  Main thing is don't worry.    Mine went on for three months.   Just at the point I thought I was dying and had to call an ambulance, they stopped, never to return.  Go figure!\n\nIt's only if they are getting progressively worse that it's a worry but that would happen over a few days not weeks.  Do post after the MRI. Regunti4: Yeah I’ve had them every day for 2-3 weeks, some days it’s a 10/10, some days it’s 6/10 pain. And a couple of days I wouldn’t get them until night time. Could possibly be from taking so much Tylenol and ibuprofen so I’m going to try and not use them next time I get one (hopefully not). But yeah I’ll post after my MRI."

Had a composite veneer fitted two months ago to replace one I had fitted way, way back (early 90s) on an upper front middle tooth.\nWas eating a snack tonight (cereal - granola) and noticed it was a little crunchier than usual, then realised my veneer had shattered - into about eight pieces!!!\nThe tooth in question is badly discoloured from where I was punched in the mouth in my youth, so I'm very conscious of it.\nIt's a bit of a nightmare, but my question is whether I have any recourse to insist that the UK dentist who fitted the veneer - which was clearly not bonded correctly or had some other issue (we're talking granola here, not a stick of rock or stale french bread!) - fits a new one without charging me for it (£240 last time).\nI only had the veneer replaced at her recommendation - I was reasonably happy with the old one. Now I have an unsightly, almost black tooth and am £240 lighter! Any advice would be appreciated!

Dental restorations used to fall under the sale of goods act, I'm not sure whether that's still the case.

It swells a little when I've eaten spicy food, and subsides after a while.\nI visited a dentist today who took an x ray of the area and said that there was no pus or fish bone lodged inside the bulge. There was no problem with the tooth either. It was just soft tissue. Since there was no pain on touching it, he called a senior dentist who looked at it and said that since the left central incisor appeared to be slightly discolored (light hint of yellow), a gum specialist had better check the problem.\nThe recommendation was to see the gum specialist and he'd probably decide to surgically remove the soft tissue which could otherwise get infected if the teeth of the lower jaw hit it or if it gets damaged an infected when brushing the teeth.\n\nQuestions:\n1. From the attached image, do you feel there really is a serious gum issue? So much that a gum specialist would need to look at it and remove the tissue?\n2. If I prevent the area from getting injured with food or a toothbrush, would it subside on its own?\n3. Is the tooth discoloration an indication of a deeper problem? Is there really a tooth discoloration?\n\nI had taken a photo of the computer screen when the dentist showed me the x ray on the screen, so I can share that if necessary."

It was quite sensitive so I went to another local dentist who saw me the next day.\n\nThey did an x-ray and said another tooth was so badly decayed it probably needed removing as there was a slim chance of saving it. It was decayed down to the nerve, etc. She showed me the x ray which had a shadow on the tooth in question. However, I'm not a dentist so it could be anything. Then came a hard sell for an implant costing £4000. They said they didn't have time to do the filling that had fallen out.\n\nNow, its not hurt or given me any cause for concern. It was not noted on my last check up 11 months ago either.\n\nI went to my normal dentist yesterday who replaced the filling. He looked at the tooth that apparently needed pulling. He said he couldn't see a problem and that the tooth had a filling on it already but was fine. The other dentist didn't mention this.\n\nI'm at a loss now because I want to believe my dentist but don't want to overlook the original dentist if they are right and there's still a chance of saving it if my normal dentist is wrong.\n\nAny advice?\n\nMany thanks Zuri Barniv: You should ask for a copy of the x-ray they used to draw their conclusions and post it here. ChumleyWarner: Excellent. I've just emailed asking for a copy. As soon as it comes, I'll upload it. \n\nI really appreciate your help. It'll save me going, and paying, for a 3rd opinion.\n\nKind regards. ChumleyWarner:  ChumleyWarner: Afternoon Zuri\n\nI've just uploaded the Right Bite Wing upper x rays. On the top one the UR4 is the furthest picture right and the bottom image is the same teeth but with the UR4 in the middle.\n\nForgive me if you could tell that already.\n\nMany thanks."

    "dialogue": "ChumleyWarner: Hi Guys\n\nI'm new to the forum and I'm looking for a bit of advice regarding a problem I'm having with one of my teeth.\n\nAbout 4 months ago I noticed one of my top molars, second to the back, was hurting. I went to the dentist who did a filling that he said wasn't small but not big. About a day later, I bit into a Chewit sweet and it felt like Mike Tyson had punched me in the face. Instant electric shock feeling. I went back and the dentist adjusted the filling. She said that should do it. About a week later I noticed my gums were sore and bleeding around the tooth and when I flossed, the floss smelled quite bad. I went back yesterday and she adjusted the filling again and said the gum problem was unrelated. I said that it still hurt when I chewed but not as much. Now, when I chew, it still hurts, albeit not anywhere near how bad it was before. The dentist said if it still hurt, Id have to have root canal treatment that would be hard on that tooth.\n\nI'm just after a second opinion if that's ok? I'm a bit unsure what's going on. Is the chewing pain and gum issue related? Ive never had it before, floss twice a day and have started using Corsodyl mouthwash. The dentist said to floss more.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thanks Zuri Barniv: If everything was fine before you had this filling, then there may be something not right with the new filling. Of course there is always a chance you need something more or the dentist did everything right, but suggesting you need a root canal at this stage seems premature in a big way. It is not possible to tell you what is wrong without seeing you or having a lot more information, this is why you might consider getting a second opinion at another office before letting her do anything more. ChumleyWarner: Thanks for the reply Zuri.\n\nIve left it a month to see how it went. The toothache pain has gone and the sensitivity to cold is low. Ive not chewed on that side for a month but did today and it hurt but not as bad. Ive noticed that when I suck a straw hard it feels like I'm ducking the filling out. This might sound mad and not be what's happening but that's what it feels like. Like the filling might be loose. The dentist didn't say that when I went.\n\nI previously had a similar problem with a tooth on the other side and a metal filling was put in and its been fine since.\n\nI'm keen to be able to chew on this side again but don't want RCT or to loose the tooth. I'm only 30 and would be quite embarrassed to have a missing tooth.\n\nI'm going to get a second opinion and ask that the filling be replaced. Does this sound right? Also, what's the failure rate of RCT on this tooth? I'll have to have an implant if it fails.\n\nmany thanks,CW ChumleyWarner: Sorry, that should say sucking the filling out. Zuri Barniv: Yeah, don't get a root canal. It sounds like the filling needs to be replaced. White fillings are much more technique sensitive and are prone to these problems. The filling may be partially \"de-bonded\" which causes it to lift and compress on the sensitive parts of the tooth when you eat, drink or suck through a straw. ChumleyWarner: Excellent, thanks Zuri.\n\nI'm going to make an appointment tomorrow and see how it goes. I'll post back on here and let you know.\n\nSincerely, thanks for the advice. Kaleb: I'm not a dentist but I think that is perfectly normal, it can be like that for a few days or maybe weeks, but it's possible that Zuri is right. ChumleyWarner: Morning Zuri.\n\nI'm not sure whether or not you post on here still but if you do, i went back to the dentist who put a dressing under the filling and then put a new filling in.\n\nIt was fine for about two years with absolutely no pain. Until it fell out. I have a job that can be quite rough at times so I think this contributed.\n\nMany thanks again Zuri Barniv: I'm glad you never did a root canal there. ChumleyWarner: Me too. Many thanks for the advice.\n\nI don't suppose you could answer my latest question about another issue I've recently had could you?\n\nIt's from today titled Filling versus no Filling Help.\n\nMany thanks again."

The curing light causes the glue to set, hence the feeling of warmth, but this is not hot enough to cause damage. A rare reaction to LA?

I went to the dentist about a week after I began feeling pain in a tooth in my top back tooth when chewing. The pain only persisted when I chewed food of any consistency. The dentist took xrays of my teeth and did a 10 minute bonding/filling procedure to fix it, (i don’t remember which one) as it was a minor cavity. Now, a week after the bonding I feel the same pain as before in the same area when chewing, and it only started today. I think the source may be lying in my broken rubber retainer which I sadly still use. I feel it is possible so does anyone think my cavity reopened? I was wondering if the reopening if a cavity has happened so soon to someone after someone has had it filled or bonded. Did the cavity turn out worse than it previously was before the bonding? I know it’s just one cavity, but having a repeat cavity after getting it fixed is just sad and worrisome. Thanks for any help. Busybee: perhaps you need a new retainer?

You should get a second opinion from another practice.   But I've been in a similar situation before (although it wasn't 11 fillings!) and it made me paranoid about the teeth in question for years.  Even though other dentists tell you that you don't need work done you worry if a dental professional tells you something like this.  \n\nI'm not sure about the wisdom teeth.  Some dentists like to extract them as a matter of course.  If you leave them they are harder to extract when you are old because there is a nerve that can be damaged.  I have all four wisdom teeth and I refused to have them extracted.   I've also been told in the past that I need a root canal and then went elsewhere for an opinion, had a filling instead (that was 10 years ago).  16 years ago a dentist told me a root canal on a front tooth was failing.  I went elsewhere was told it's fine but it made me really anxious about the tooth.  The same dentist told me I'd need a back tooth filling replacing but then I was told by others there's nothing wrong with it. \n So now I always get a second opinion on any major work recommendation where I don't have any symptoms.  I had such a situation recently and it made me lose confidence in the dentist.  I've been told that the motive is financial which is shocking.  Any dental work is a risk so you should only have it done if absolutely necessary. quasarmarch: I have attached all the x-rays so that I can get a professional opinion!\nI highly appreciate your reply busybee. \nI wonder if I should move this to another section to get a dentist provide opinion!

The internet is great, but it's no substitute for face to face consultations. MattKW: Nuh, can't see the cavities he's talking about, apart from the 38 (LL8, wisdom tooth). There is a small amount of early decay on distal surface of 27 (UL7), but too shallow to treat. If you keep diet and hygiene up to standard, then it won't progress. You only need to extract that wisdom tooth, and for that, I'd go somewhere else rather than give this fellow any $. quasarmarch: MattKW said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNuh, can't see the cavities he's talking about, apart from the 38 (LL8, wisdom tooth).

The last being in 2015 August. The bridge has come loose from my own tooth that was pared down while the other abutment is a root canal treated tooth with a fibre post. The bridge is well attached to the fibre post but loose on the other side. \nWould it be possible to remove the bridge without damaging the bridge or post and refit/glue? I was considering that if the post broke on removal I might have the root canal treated tooth removed (now there is evidence for dead teeth causing bacteria which in the blood can cause heart attacks and cancer) and a titanium implant fitted. I may have the two done because of the likelihood of a loosening and recurring decay. On the other hand I had thought that having a titanium post fitted if there is such a thing. As it may be easier to remove and refit without breaking if the bridge came loose again. This has happened a number of times throughout my life.  I have a second crown on the bottom front which has a metal post, it has been there for over 40 years probably nearer 45 years. It got a chip on the porcelain a couple of years ago and the dentist pared it down removed the crown and fitted new, no problems. Why do I have so much cost and trouble with this bridge?

It has been hurting for about a year and a half when I brush that spot with my toothbrush.  More recently, it has started hurting worse, and also hurts if I press on side of the gum close to the tooth with my finger.  I've mentioned it to my hygienist a couple times during cleanings, but she said it looks normal, and nothing showed up on X-rays.  Even now when I look at it in the mirror, it looks normal, with no redness or anything else on the gum.  There are also no cavities or fillings on that tooth.\n\nDoes anyone here have any idea what the cause of the pain is?

So I thought I'd see if anyone here might have some idea of what's going on with this tooth. Busybee: Could just be that you have an area of sensitivity.  Maybe you have been over brushing there because you worry about it.  Or you might just have a high point in your bite.  Dentists tend to recommend sensitive toothpaste or some fluoride treatment (paste) as quite often such problems resolve over time.   Can seem awful for a while and then they settle.  Also if they start to treat the tooth it can make things worse.   Have you tried rubbing a little sensitive toothpaste into the area and leaving it for a bit?

Have you tried rubbing a little sensitive toothpaste into the area and leaving it for a bit? I do have sensitive teeth and have used sensitivity toothpaste before, but it never seemed to really help.  Right now I've been using a tube of Sensodyne like my hygienist keeps recommending.  But the sensitivity on my other teeth is different.  None of my other teeth have sensitivity to pressing on it with my tongue or finger like the one I'm currently concerned about.  Also, it's not temperature sensitive.  That difference with this one is what has me concerned.  I've actually been brushing that spot less now because it just hurts too much.\n\nI could also point out that I had braces from when I was 34 until 36, and now I'm 46.  I've been noticing a lot of gum recession all around my mouth.  My hygienist says this could be caused by the braces.  Perhaps it also relates to my back tooth? Busybee: Gum recession can be inherited or it can be down to diet/lifestyle.  Are you getting enough vitamins?  But it's also down to age.   Do you use an electric brush & floss?    How is your bite?  A lot of sensitivity is caused by bite issues.  You must wear retainers.  Maybe you should have some new ones made and see if that makes a difference to both your gums and the tooth.

My first set broke while I was cleaning them 6 years after getting my braces removed.  So I guess it's been about 5 since starting my second set.  I figured this would be surprising to you because when I went to the orthodontist's office after 6 years to get a new backup set, the receptionist was amazed that it had been so long.  She said that most people come back every couple months for a new set, and some do it every 2 weeks.  I can't imagine having to spend $20 every 2 weeks or 2 months for new retainers which my ortho said I'll probably have to use for the rest of my life. Busybee: Maybe the receptionist is getting mixed up between retainers and invisialign braces where they have new trays all the time.     But it might be worth changing retainers as it's possible your tooth surfaces have worn a bit over time and you might be pressing on that tooth at night when you didn't before."

Do you have sensitivity and is it amalgam (silver) or composite (white)? Corin1991: It’s a composite filling as it’s at the front. I’m wondering about asking for a crown instead. Is it possible to remove a filling and would a crown irritate it less? Corin1991: And yes my teeth have always been a bit sensitive Busybee: With a crown there's always a risk that you could trigger root failure.    You could end up with a different problem.  You could ask them to replace the filling, but each time they drill a tooth and add a filling they have to use a bit of acid to make it all stick.   If you broke the tooth it could be that it doesn't have a perfect structure for a crown.   They may have had to fill below the gum line.  You should really discuss your options with your dentist as they have all the information.  Ideally go for a second opinion at another dentist.  They should run through all the risks and the likely outcome."

    "title": "Tooth abfraction and receded gum help",
    "dialogue": "lizziebear114: Hello!\n\nI am an 18 year old with good oral health, according to my dentists. I brush twice a day and try to floss almost every day and between meals.\n\nHowever, in October, I realized that the gum of my left front tooth had receded and there was some damage to my tooth itself. You can't see it when I smile, but I feel it when I run my tongue over it.\n\nI asked a dentist about this at my cleaning in October, and she said it was fine, and that I was just brushing too hard. Not to worry about it falling out or anything.\n\nIt has still been bothering me. It feels really sensitive when I talk, swallow, and eat. It doesn't \"hurt\" but it's uncomfortable and tender.\n\nI use a Phillips Sonicare tooth brush but am careful not to aggravate the area. I turn off the brush and carefully use it manually to get rid of bacterial buildup in the area.\n\nI visisted the dentist again in January for a cavity filling and the dentist, again said my teeth were great, dug around in the divet where the gum receded, and found that were was no bacterial decay, but they did nothing to fix the problem.\n\nIt's been bothering me so much that I am starting to develop a lisp because when I talk I try to prevent my lips from touching the tender area. I'm afraid that it's going to fall out, which I know is irrational.\n\nI just don't understand why the dentists haven't helped me with this. I am scheduled for a cleaning in May, as I am a college student and don't have access to a dentist at school unless I ask a friend to take me 40 minutes away.\n\nI do not drink soda or eat very much candy. I avoid acidic foods. I even stopped drinking coffee. I need some advice on this.\n\nThanks,\nLizzie DrToothache: You have some recession in the area of #9. When this happens, cementum can become exposed and is usually more sensitive than enamel. \n\nIt is hard to tell in just that one picture, but it doesn't look like the recession is very extreme - meaning that it is highly unlikely that this would cause you to lose the tooth. Just make sure that you are not brushing / flossing aggressively.\n\nAs far as the sensitivity, there is an OTC option that you can try. You can try using Sensodyne toothpaste to decrease the amount of sensitivity. Sensodyne has tiny particles in the paste that blocks dentinal tubules, therefore blocking sensitivity of the tooth. It can take up to a month for the effects to work, so don't give up if you don't feel results immediately. \n\nHowever I recommend that you return to your dentist for further care. There are desensitizing options that he/she can try on the exposed root surface. It is possible that when you brought up the sensitivity initially that he did not realize how much of a problem this tooth has been for you. Make it clear what your chief complaint is about that tooth so that the dentist can provide you the best treatment!\n\nI hope that helps you. Best of luck."

Now I am having root pain and may need a root canal. I would have rather had a filling a year or two ago.\n\nShould/could this have been seen earlier? Janet Two Hawks: Generally, you should have two cleaning a year with hygienist, and X-rays/exam once a year with dentist, unless you have some reason for more frequent treatment.   Have you had annual X-rays, or have you skipped that part?   As good as your dentist is, they don’t have X-ray vision.  A tooth can die at any time, but if a patient is diagnosed with caries, ignores it, the outcome is eventual root canal."

Fortunately I can control this by taking Heartburn medication. I was wondering if the line of pain is a nerve.\n\nI should mention that the LL1 tooth has been extracted due to failed root canal treatment and a fixed bridge installed. The pain was there before the bridge. Busybee: Perhaps the nerve was damaged during the extraction? Jethro: Can someone qualified please tell me if there is anything wrong with this dental X-ray. It looks to me like filling material after root canal treatment has spilled from the base of the tooth into the gum and I would like to know if this is normal or will it cause problems. There is also a gap half way down, should it be there? Janet Two Hawks: You are correct and you need an apicoectomy. The dark spot around the root tip may be infection from that.

You really have to rely on the technology being perfect (which I am sure it never is) karinayogateacher: Yes I meant ceramic sorry! Busybee: It depends on where the crown goes, because a front tooth crown is a work of art by the technician.  Perhaps the technology can make it special too, but the human input is not easily replicated.    Depends how fussy you are about appearance.  Some people don't mind if it doesn't look as translucent etc. karinayogateacher: Thanks for your reply... I already have a front crown made with CEREC couple of years ago and honestly, it looks more natural than the ones that were made at labs KVMCruces: Hi Karinayogateacher,\n\nAs a dental technician I will say that CEREC is not the best option if you're needing an anterior tooth replaced. Dentists are busy enough as it is, ALL of my dentist clients have CEREC but don't use it because they dont have time and also because they crowns they make NEVER look as good as the work I provide them with. If CEREC was so great then dentists wouldn't need lab technicians such as myself \n\nWhat the dentist told you about CAD/CAM creating porcelain teeth that do not look natural is COMPLETELY FALSE. Emax (aka ceramic) is excellent for anterior teeth but so is PFZ (porcelain fused to zirconia). Both can be highly aesthetic.\nFCZ (full contour zirconia) is more for posterior teeth. But still, can be made to look natural it just depends on how skilled the lab technician is.\n\nEmax is the closest looking to natural teeth however, it is extremely weak. There are new advanced materials that offer both translucency and strength."

I went to the endodontist who applied 2 cartridges, 3.6mL total lidocaine.  As soon as the numbing started, I was unable to move without my equilibrium being disturbed, if I opened my eyes the ceiling was rapidly spinning and every time I moved, I would vomit, lasting approximately 1.5 hours.  As soon as the numbness wore off, the reaction stopped, leaving me feeling a bit hungover.\n\nWe tried it again, this time without epi.  2 cartridges, 3.6mL total of Mepivicaine was used, same reaction.  This time, I was administered oxygen as I believe it was more panic than anything.\n\nI waited until 2016 to try again, this time 2 carpials of 3% carbocaine (not sure what that means, dentist wrote it) was injected and the same reaction.\n\nI had skin allergy testing to mepivacaine HCL3% which came back negative.\n\nI now have an abscess on this tooth and am in need of a root canal as soon as i'm done with my antibiotics.  I also need to have the molar behind it removed or a root canal as it is also infected.\n\nI will note that I have a mouth full of metal, spanning back from my childhood.

I've seen a dentist this morning who suggested an implant ASAP and he cemented the crown back until Monday (He said the cement will probably just last a couple days) when he wants to the following:\n\nMonday, take impressions for a partial I think its the retainer? It looked pink to me with a fake teeth attached to the pink retainer which he said I have to wear for 4 months and he will do bone grafting as well he said he CANT put a fake crown and that the only option is to wear the retainer until he does the implant\n\nIn 4 months he will do the implant and thats when maybe he can send me home with a fake crown and no more retainers\n\nHowever, I asked my long time dentist who lives in a different city and told me that according to the XR's I have a fracture from the sticky thing I ate and I don't need an implant since the crown its in perfect shape can be cemented back like it was before. He also said that probably in the future i might need an implant but he said not right now.\n\n Can you please tell me If I really need an implant and whats your opinion? \n\nThank you and looking forward to hear from you.

I googled and you have the ADA (American Dental Association).  They have a site called \"Find a Dentist\".  Just google that and ADA and you should find it.  Select \"prosthodontics\" in the \"specialty\" drop down box.  You can also find an endodontist here if you need one.  It appears to be a reputable body.   Every dentist in the UK has to be registered on our GDC (General dental council) and this gives public access to the qualification and authorisation to practise.  I'm not sure if you have an equivalent body in the US.   I hope you have some luck with this website. karinayogateacher: Busibee, Thank you very much!"

    "title": "Abscess or Sinus Infection? Both?",
    "dialogue": "Tam May: Hi Everyone,\nI guess I\"m just looking for some comfort . I am quite worried. I have basically not been to a dentist in almost 30 years. At the time, I had about 4 root canals done and a few cavities filled – I was about 18 or 19. For most of the years following, I didn't have too many issues (I think I may have gone once to a dentist in 2005 or 2006 to have a cavity filled) and I've tried to be careful with oral health.\n\nAbout a year or so ago I started to see some fillings fall out from both my right and left side but couldn’t go to a dentist because I had no insurance and no money to pay out of pocket.\n\nAbout a few months ago, I did get some insurance (crappy as it is). About a month ago, a back molar (the one next to the wisdom tooth) on the upper left side broke (a piece of it about halfway across the tooth and down near the gum – there isn’t a hole that exposes the gum). I called a dentist closest to me (I don’t have a car and there aren’t many buses in my area so I’m limited with transportation) and made an appointment but they could only get me in on January 20. I was feeling fine, no pain or anything, so I thought it was OK to wait (being very careful with what I eat, no crunchy stuff, etc). On Christmas day (2 days ago), the tooth right next to the broken one began to ache. It’s not excruciating pain and it mainly hurts when I bite down on it so it’s tolerable. I’m taking Advil (which is helping) as well as doing salt water rinses and apple cider vinegar rinses (which also help). I’m now trying to find another dentist that will take me earlier than the 20th, as the other dental office claims they don’t have an earlier appointment and I don’t want to risk the pain getting worse, since it just started.\n\nHere’s the thing, though. About two months ago, I started getting some sinus pressure and pain on the same side of my face. I suffer from chronic migraines so I thought it was related to that. It was like a dull (but persistent) ache around my left cheekbone and across the back near the ear and around the upper jawline (and sometimes the lower jawline also), as well as sometimes pressure on the right side (though much less severe). I went to a doctor and he said I had allergies and gave me a prescription for a nasal spray (which didn’t help) and antibiotics (but I didn’t take them, as he said to only take them if I started to get a fever and feel really bad but that never happened). The sinus pressure/pain went away after about 2 weeks. But earlier this week it returned (though it's more sinus pressure than actual pain and more localized around the upper left hand side under my cheekbone/near my nose and it's on both sides). It was a few days afterwards that the tooth pain started.\n\nI’m really praying that it’s not going to be a big issue and that it’s not an abscess. My gut feeling is that the broken tooth is going to have to be pulled (which I am terrified of) and that maybe the tooth pain I’m getting in the tooth next to it (which, as far as I know, is a healthy tooth – I really don’t know what is or is not healthy anymore since I had all my heavy dental work done 30 years ago) is really coming from the broken tooth, as they lay right next to one another (and there is what feels like a slight crack right on that side that borders the healthy tooth).\n\nThe last root canal I had was in 1988 or 1989. Somebody please tell me that procedures have improved in the last 30 years so that it's not as much of an ordeal anymore :-D.\n\nTam Miserable: You sound like me! I realize that this is an old msg., but I'm hoping that someone sees it. I could have written this. The details are very similar, except that my problem is on the right side of my face, and I'm older, have broken, worn down teeth; my last root canal was about 30 years ago (those teeth later needed to be extracted). Also, I do have dentist (pay out of pocket); but he's bleeding me dry. I am getting over two respiratory infections, one on top of the other; have asthma, too. Wasn't on antibiotics, as doc determined that infections were viral. Now, tooth acting up, but also, mild pain in face, and also, severe, intermittent pain in both broken tooth and in adjacent teeth. I also have migraines! Weather has been weird, so I thought it was that... (I mean, my migraines act up with the weather, along whith arthritis). I had to miss choir this AM... then, pain went away. Feel as though TN (or nerve on that side) affected, too. Can't figure out what's going on, but I do know the broken tooth has to come out, anyway. Was hoping I could wait longer, as I'm broke. Now, not sure what to do... how long to wait? Busybee: Sorry to hear you've been so unwell.   Are your lymph nodes on the side the tooth is on tender to the touch and do you have a fever?   If it's the tooth needing a root canal then the tip of the root above the tooth would be sore.  I'm sure you remember from when you had the other root canals. \n\nThe thing is that what you are describing could be down to the bite.  If you have a broken tooth that could have upset the bite and the alignment of the jaw.  Bite problems can cause nerve pain, migraines, face pain etc.   Is it worse in the morning?  (You mentioned it went away during the day).  If so you could try a nightguard to see if that relieves it at night. Miserable: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSorry to hear you've been so unwell.

Miserable: Hi, Yes, I know it's both my bite and I already use Nightguard (unless I fall asleep, first). : ( It's upper tooth, so I'm not sure about lymph nodes... no fever. I am not experiencing pain, now; just some tenderness. I know that tooth I'm concerned about (which is broken) has to come out, at some point-- just wondering when? Trying to ascertain if abscess, migraine, sinus, or what? If bite, that's ongoing-- for years, now. I just don't have the money to do extensive repairs, all at once. I have fragile, ground- down teeth. A lot of ongoing stress. Just trying to figure out what's going on. The pain last night was excruciating-- then it went away. Weird. I did have some cheek/face tenderness, too. Not now, though. Am also having email problems, so I may not receive replies straightaway. Is it possible to bruise a tooth temporarily? Or does it mean that I ought to have it ought right away? It takes me forever to recuperate from an extraction (about 6 wks.), so I'm waiting for the \"right time\", both with other things I need to deal with, and with money being tight. Thx. Busybee: Yes it's possible to bruise a tooth and then for it to recover completely.  It's happened to me several times with a crowned tooth that's had root treatment.  But if your tooth has broken then it could be that it's knocked the bite that step further.  You should try to keep a pain diary of exactly what you do each day and then see when the pain starts.

I am keeping a mental log (already keep other logs-- too much going on) , and I have noticed that acidic food (like tomato- based sauces) make the pain worse. However, the worst of it seems to be over, pretty much. I still feel it, but it's not unbearable. And sometimes, I don't feel it at all. I have several other medical conditions/appt's to keep track of, and little money; so I'm trying to figure out what to prioritize, at this point. I am waiting for \"a good time\" to get this broken tooth out. I am wondering how long I can wait? This is a bad time for me... wondering if I can wait about 2 months? The dentist had put something on it that was supposed to numb the nerve until the summer (didn't work)-- but I think I'll need to have it taken care of before that. Nevertheless, I don't think it's an emergency, now. I am waiting a few days to see if the severe, stabbing pain returns. So far, it hasn't.  Thx. Busybee: You can wait a long time provided it's not infected.  If you have an infection and it's an upper tooth then it's more risky to leave it in for too long because it's closer to the brain and eyes. An infection also reduces bone around the root which isn't great for the surrounding teeth or can spread apparently.    You can usually delay the process by taking antibiotics which your dentist can prescribe.   I'm sure you can wait a couple of months but it may affect your immune system making you feel really grotty and more prone to viruses etc.   You do seem to have been waiting quite a while already though.  I didn't think an extraction was too expensive but at least ask your dentist for antibiotics. Miserable: Busybee said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tYou can wait a long time provided it's not infected.

If there is sufficient tooth above the root that's intact then they should be able to save it.  I had a similar problem and as I said on another thread, one dentist said it's in need of a root canal and another saved it.  It's all down to the dentist and their skill and experience.  But if the fracture is in the root then yes there is no way to save it.   In terms of the pain, they numb the area and you should not feel anything.  They should be able to give an injection without you feeling anything.  It again depends on the skill of the dentist.   Some dentists are really good with giving painless injections and painless treatment."

I was told there was bacteria behind my old filling and due to lack of support part of my tooth is gone. I have quarter of my original tooth left.\nXray now shows this very close to nerve. I have been fitted with temporary filling for 3 months to assess how things go after which either be new permanent filler, or crown or root canal as worse case.\nIts been 4 days since my temporary filler and my tooth is so sensitive even drinking water at room temprature. I am avoiding chewing on that side.\nSo my question really is should the drilling be so harsh to make patients loose part of tooth and so close to the nerve that creates more problems that before please? Or is this normal practice and its common for people to end up with major filling or even a crown. \nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\nMany thanks. Busybee: It would be very difficult to prove anything.  If you had an x ray done before the filling you could take that to another dentist for an opinion.    But any dental work can upset a tooth, particularly if it's a molar with a big filling.   In my experience some dentists are less invasive than others and have different techniques.  But you don't know that until they start to work on a tooth.  It's best to go to a \"minimally invasive\" practice if you are worried."

Good day - I hope that this message finds your wife feeling much better. I am writing this reply to any and everyone who has had bite adjustments. Two years ago, I went through this process - I don't even recall how many \"adjustments\" I had and am embarrassed to state how many dentists I saw about it. I even almost spent 5K on a procedure that they provide to people with TMJ. Bottom line: About a year and a half later, I can not tell a difference. This may not be the case for many or even most, but I let me mind get the best of me. It's not that it wasn't different. Obviously, after grinding down so many teeth, there will be some difference, but I was stuck on the idea of it all feeling \"like it did,\" which was not going to happen. Time moved on, and eventually something else took its place, and I haven't looked back since. But, I say all of this to say that \"it will be okay.\" It will. Don't read any more blogs; don't go see any more dentists; don't stare at your smile in the mirror, trying to \"see\" what is off - just find something else to consume your thoughts, and the discomfort will leave. I promise. Busybee: Best to have fillings done one at a time.  That way your bite is adjusted to what you already have.  Even one filling can make things feel off so 9 will completely change the bite.  Once it's lost it's impossible to replace with what you had.  The brain is programmed to expect the teeth to meet in a certain place.  That's usually the place that the body has come to recognise (the neck, the shoulders, the jaw joint etc).  So changing it can make not only the mouth feel odd, but it can affect the entire gait.  It can even affect the spine and legs.  These are not major changes and eventually you will get used to a slightly different feeling in the neck or shoulders (or you may not even connect it to your teeth).  But they are often unnecessary if dental work is carried out slowly in a careful plan.    \n\nI've had all sorts, pain in shoulder, neck, even shooting pains in my arms, lower back, face, jaw joint, ringing in the ears, headaches etc.  All at different times and as a result of different \"fixes\" to try to bring the bite back to some sort of balance after it was damaged with an adjustment.  There is no machine that can fix it.  You should avoid touching it and if you have to have  work  done do it slowly.   A careful approach with a dentist who knows what they are doing can help make the bite more comfortable.  But someone drilling more away is just going to cause a different problem."

I have been informed by my dentist of the pros and cons between NHS free denture and paying private for dentures.\nShe said that the NHS is basically one size fits all and the dentures are bulky.. where as if I pay to go independent the denture will be finer and made to fit properly and the technician will make adjustments until the denture fits perfectly and I am happy with it. It will cost £250. I would like to hear from anyone who has had NHS and independent dentures made.\nAlso when I had the impression taken yesterday, before I had made the decision to go private and pay for the denture, the mould didn't even fit my mouth, it was too big and then when I said I was going to pay privately, my dentist said she would send away to get the proper mould tray to fit my mouth. The inside of the corners of my mouth are actually sore and slightly swollen the morning. So my question is... Was the mould tray she used an NHS one size fits all? Is that actually true that there is only one size mould tray fits all? Do you get a better service going private than what you get on the NHS? I look forward to hearing your views on this matter-thanks. Busybee: There is no one size fits all mould tray if you mean for making dental impressions.  It's not like it's an expensive piece of equipment and dentists should have various sizes, given they treat children too.  Any dentist that does both private and NHS work should have all the equipment already.    In terms of going private you may  have access to better materials."

It must have been awful.    \n\nYou really should go to a dentist and see if they can suggest any treatments to reduce the sensitivity.   They will need to remove the calculus as you could be more prone to decay if your enamel is worn.  In the meantime, make sure you floss and get a soft brush and some sensitive paste until you see the dentist.   You should gently brush them with a sensitive paste.

I have always had healthy teeth and just a few weeks ago ..around my left canine tooth it started looking irritated. I immediately panicked and started flossing even more...and using mouthwash twice a day. I was assuming it was bacteria irritating it. I do floss (I try to every day..occasionally I forget but not often) and I brush 2-3 Times/day. I try my best to take care of my teeth. \n\nI’m starting to wonder if it’s just my brushing technique or if it’s something more. Does this look like irritation from brushing too hard? My toothbrush is soft for anyone wondering. There’s no pain with food or cold/hot sensitivity. It just simply only looks red around that one gum line. If I touch it with my finger...I can slightly feel a little irritation but nothing painful.\n\n\nThank you in advance for any advice! Busybee: Ouch! that looks sore.  I'm not sure how you did it but you should see a dentist to see if they can give you any treatment to help it heal.  The rest of the gums look healthy and you have really lovely teeth.   I've found Peroxyl really helpful for helping this sort of thing to heal.   The Peroxyl was given to me by a dentist when I had a gum surgery to lengthen a crown before a veneer was placed.  It's not for long term use and i'm not sure all dentists approve of it.  But when I've had any gum soreness for whatever reason since, it seems to give some relief.  \n\nBut most dentists will probably say leave it alone for a few days and don't irritate it with over brushing or flossing too much.  I'd recommend upping your vitamin C for a few days maybe (based on personal experience it helps gum soreness and mouth ulcers).  Not sure what your diet is like but maybe you are low on fruit and veg?   Maybe you just damaged it when you were eating.  That can happen.   \n\nLet us know how you get on and keep smiling!"

It just doesn't seem that healthy swishing lots of chemicals around your mouth on a daily basis.  It's not a cure for gum disease.

    "dialogue": "Dale: I've had this hard spot under my gums behind my back molar for some time, but have just noticed an opening with something appearing to be in it. Could this be my wisdom tooth? I'm 23 and have not had them removed. Or could it be an absess of some sort? It isn't painful by itself, but if I jut out my lower jaw and scrape the mysterious sore against my top back molar, it does feel like I'm scraping a wound. Help and/or advice would be much appreciated! Busybee: if your wisdom teeth haven't erupted that's most likely what it is.  They do come out around your age.  I was 21, but I must admit I never took a mirror out and had a look.  It's weird because as an adult you forget what it's like.  But as a child it's happening all the time so you get used to it.   Try not to play with it.  If it does get really hot and painful then go to a dentist.  Wisdom teeth can impact if you don't have room. Dale: Thank you!!!"

I brush 2-3 times a day and floss regularly, chew mint gum and try to do all the regular daily teeth and mouth care in general, but I always have this “raw meat” type breath and it has affected my confidence greatly to a point where I no loner speak to anyone closer than 1-2 steps to me and try to communicate by nodding and always trying to keep a distance.\nMy dad and grandfather both have the same exaxt issue. From what I’ve experienced, the smell only goes away for half an hour to an hour after eating so I always have snacks on me which helps but has caused me to gain some weight. It helps a lot when I stay hydrated so I’ve been trying to drink around 3 litres of water everyday but the smell is still noticeable. \nThank you for reading \nI appreciate any help Lyle MacLeod: Hi Parsa\n\nYou could try using a mouthwash that contains chlorine dioxide and zinc compounds. I know that sulfur can produce a foul smell and this kind of mouthwash will help fight these off. I would check with your dentist first before you try this, just to make sure this is actually the problems, but I've heard it can really help (for a few hours). Busybee: It could be that you have a benign problem with oesophageal motility.  This means that when you swallow food it doesn't go down to your stomach as fast as it does with someone who doesn't have this condition.  The fact that members of your family have the same problem could point to something like that.    It's not dangerous and you'd need to have something like a barium swallow test to diagnose it.   If that's the case then you'd need to avoid eating too much at one sitting and making sure you drink plenty of water to help food go down.    It can go hand in hand with gastric reflux so avoiding acid causing foods might help.   But this is something you should see your doctor about rather than your dentist."

    "dialogue": "Aung Thiha: 30th December 2017\nI fell down on ice and hit my three upper front teeth while I was iceskating. One of the affected teeth wiggled a little bit if I move it with my hands. All of them hurt even without touching.\n\n31st December 2017\nI went to a dental clinic. Found out that all three of the affected teeth have craze lines, one possibly cracked and that one was still hurting even without touching. The other two didn't hurt anymore and confirmed to be just craze lines by the doctor. The doctor said it needs a root canal treatment and a crown. The doctor did no x-ray, no electric test. The doctor tested with a sharp steel pin.\n\n5th January 2018\nI went to a different dental clinic. The doctor tested using x-ray, electric test and a sharp steel pin. I thought the tooth doesn't move anymore. So, I answered to the doctor the tooth is not loose anymore. The tooth hurt only when it's hit with a little force. My tooth didn't respond to the electric test. The doctor confirmed that my tooth doesn't need any crown but it needs a root canal treatment. She also said that there is no inflammation by pointing at the x-ray result.\n\n6th January 2018\nI went to the same clinic(from 5th jan) for root canal treatment. Another doctor tested using a steel pin. Force from the bottom hurts more than from the front. Pressure on gum also hurt but not as much as hitting the tooth from the front. I answered to the doctor the tooth doesn't move anymore. He confirmed by trying to move it. He said my tooth nerve still has 50% chance to be healed by itself. He told me to wait 6 months.\n\n10th January 2018\nI tested myself with my finger. The tooth still hurt if I hit it with a little force but not as much as on 6th Jan. I look into the mirror and found out that it doesn't align with other teeth correctly. It's a little bit lower than the other one on the right. So, I tried moving up with my hand. It moved up. It doesn't hurt by moving. it just moved. It only hurts to force like hitting. However, the tooth is not loose enough for tongue to move.\n\nMy concern is that I answered to the doctor that the tooth doesn't move anymore when in fact, it still moves if I move it with my hand. As I mentioned, the doctor also confirmed about it by moving with his hands but it's not that noticeable because he didn't use that much of pressure. Should I go back to the doctor again? what should I do? Busybee: Firstly stop wiggling the tooth yourself.    Secondly, don't go iceskating again without wearing a mouthguard!\n\n Go back to the dentist, tell him what's happening and ask them whether they can splint\" the tooth (this is not that nice but will hopefully keep the tooth safe while the ligament and bone heal).   Be careful not to grind on it.  Maybe you need a nightguard too to stop you accidentally knocking it when you sleep.    Whatever you do ask them to use the most minimally invasive method.  \n\nBy the way you cannot tell whether or not you need a root canal so soon after an accident, it can take a few weeks for it to be apparent in an x ray.  I hope your teeth do heal well. Aung Thiha: Hi, thank you for the reply. I went to the doctor yesterday. He said it's normal to be loose and it will be ok again after a few months. Splinting is required only if it's loose more than that.\n\n18th January 2018\nMy tooth wasn't sensitive until yesterday. My tooth didn't respond to electric test 13 days ago and All of a sudden, now it's sensitive to cold water and air. What does it mean? Busybee: It sounds like it's healing. Aung Thiha: status update\n\n\n20th January 2018\nStarted using syndrome toothpaste that has potassium nitrate and sodium fluoride. it doesn't have stannous fluoride. I also take 1 cod liver oil and 1 cup of full fat milk everyday in the morning. I still feel pain when I drink cold water and it's also sensitive to air. It's not sensitive to not so hot water.\n\n23rd January 2018\nmy tooth is still sensitive to cold water and air. it's not sensitive to hot water. One thing I noticed today is that the other one on the right is also sensitive and it also hurts when it hits with a force. Don't know if my tooth is still loose or not. I don't test my tooth by myself anymore because the doctor told me not to. I'll call the left front tooth 'A' and the right front tooth 'B' to make it easier to refer. Busybee: Well that's good news.  IIt doesn't sound like it's going to fall out anytime this decade.  As long as you don't do any dangerous sports you should be ok."

He has suggested that it would be best to leave the crowns in place for now and reassess at the next 6 monthly checkup. \n\nI'm wondering if this is normal procedure? I've read that crowned teeth that have had a root canal have no blood vessels in them and therefore my immune system cannot possibly clean the infections, so will the infection just worsen and spread to other teeth? \n\nThanks. Busybee: Sometimes x rays look as if the tooth has an infected root.  But when another dentist looks it is all clear.    Many years ago a dentist told me a root treated crowned front tooth was infected.  It made me really paranoid about that tooth.  It was 18 years ago, the tooth is still there with no other dentist confirming it's infected.  So I'd recommend you get a second opinion.  Do you have any pain or tenderness? payzillee: There is no pain or noticeable swelling but when I touch the gum I feel a slight tingling. One of the crowns does need replacing anyway.

    "title": "Is this broken tooth safe to leave as is?",
    "dialogue": "Jethro: The side of my tooth broke away a few days ago, revealing the filling and unprotected centre. My dentist gave me three options. 1. Its OK to leave as it is.  2. Add a filling to the existing filling.  3. Remove the old filling and fit a new one.  I was amazed when she said it was OK to leave as it was, even though it was not causing any pain. \nIs she correct in saying its OK to leave as is?   (I'm a UK NHS patient) apl789: no. Get it seen to asap. Jethro: I thought so, fairly obvious really but wanted a second opinion. I went to see another NHS dentist and they put some temporary white fill material to stop bacteria getting in (see photo). I wonder why my regular dentist didn't think of doing that. They said if a full crown was fitted the remaining tooth would soon crumble, so I would be better off with a partial metal crown or alternatively a white filling. I think I will go with the white filling. Busybee: I am surprised any dentist would want to leave it as it is.   Strange they cannot crown it but then different dentists have different approaches and they have seen your underlying tooth structure so we can't really comment.  You should be able to have a partial crown.  Gold is probably best but not sure if the NHS do it.  Whatever you choose get it done by a good dentist.    They can probably make a filling of the whole area or the white filling but it wouldn't be as strong as a gold onlay and might break away in the future.  Depends on the skill of the dentist. Jethro: My regular dentist was favouring her first option, to the point it felt like she was recommending leaving as it was. Only when she could see I thought it odd did she then mention the other two options. And don't forget she still let me walk away saying it will be OK if I kept it clean and did not offer a protective filling to keep out the bacteria that would develop, as clearly it was a food trap. Others here and on another forum have said it needs sorting asap as the remaining filling will most likely come out and take the attached piece of tooth with it.\n\nThe second dentist gave two options and said it needed a partial crown (something my regular dentist never mentioned), as a full crown would cause the remaining tooth to crumble, but then said I would have to go private if I wanted a white filling. However a white filling has been offered free on the NHS at my regular dentist. Clearly she knew she had to do something to replace the piece of missing tooth and thankfully fitted a temporary filling to protect it while I made up my mind.  For patients it is a horrible mine field at times. Busybee: If you leave as is the surrounding teeth will suffer as it's weak and doesn't protect the remaining tooth structure.  If it were my tooth I'd go for a partial crown.  I'd get someone good to do the work as the filling you have doesn't look high quality.  You don't want to lose that tooth, go to a decent dentist and have it done well. Jethro: How do you find a decent dentist? Busybee: Personal recommendation is the best route.  If you are going to the NHS then the NHS choices site has reviews.  You can also check the care quality commission site to see if there has been a satisfactory inspection, although that does not mean that the dentist's work is guaranteed as high quality, just that they have ticked the boxes of maintaining health and safety rules.  Check their general dental council registration.   NHS dentists don't have as much flexibility because of the way the contract works.  They rush too much and with a problem like yours you need someone to take their time and get it right in order to save the tooth. Jethro: UPDATE:\nHere is a photo of the current progress on fitting a new white crown.\nThe temporary filling has been removed along with the old filling and other half of my tooth.\nA white protective material has been fitted covering whats left of the original tooth. A new crown is being made and I have an appointment to fit it this week. The only painful bit was the injection to the inside of the roof of my mouth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI forgot to mention my new dentist also discovered some of the filling has come away from whats left of a rear molar. You can just about see this in the photo. Now I think about it, I remember loosing bits form that molar before the broken tooth. I'm guessing my old dentist must have also missed this as she never said anything about it. Yet another reason to change dentist. Jethro: Following my new dentists discovery of the missing filling in a bottom rear molar, I think the tooth is called UL6 shown at the top in the photo below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy new dentist asked me to request my dental records which have also been sent to me. They show that in March 2017 she noted the UL6 tooth was defective and broken, yet no treatment was offered or carried out. In December I had an emergency appointment to look at the broken UL4 tooth with missing buccal cusp, which of course was the main subject of this post. I find it very strange why she did not also mention that the filling in UL6 was completely missing, she must have noticed as after all its only one tooth away. I think I should stress that I may be old and gittish, but I am punctual, polite and very clean, so there is absolutely no reason for any decent dentist to not do a proper job. Busybee: Unfortunately not all dentists are of the same standard.   That's why half spend most of their time fixing errors others have made."

Had a second crown put on made purposely high. Height felt perfect for the banging teeth in front problem. But started to hurt because it was too high (long). Dentist was slowly taking it down, then I feel because both of us were going on vacation she went too fast and took too much off at one time in the wrong place which led to front teeth banging again. Bottom teeth are hitting underneath of top teeth now, before other teeth. I have many Crowns that were made too short that helped create this kind of bite.  Dentist still feels crown is too high. I don't want it any lower. Her only suggestion was grindingbottom teeth or going to orthodontist. I fear tooth sensitivity if I grind bottom teeth. And fear it won't work after all is said and done.

The way it looks just has me paranoid. drmins: Nothing to worry about, as you don't show any features of a dry socket. Just gargle well after each time you have any food and maintain the oral hygiene, to prevent any possible food lodgement in the sockets. That's it."

I am in a different country and gosh don't even remember the name of the dental office I had been a few years back. so need some ideas. I think she said that my gums were thinning or something like that and applied something that will act like artificial enamel so the nerves are protected. vancouverdentist: Junkone,\n\nIt could have been restorative (filling) material of some kind, or a layer of varnish that was applied to the symptomatic area. Whatever the material was, it acted to protect the inside of the tooth (dentin) which can be quite sensitive to temperature. \n\nBest advice is to seek professional dental help. If that is not possible, something you can try doing is using sensitivity toothpaste like Sensodyne which can also act as a temporary protective coat.\n\nHope this helps. Mike F.: I use MI paste to help with sensitivity and to restore enamel. My dentist used during my visit and gave me a tube to take home. Has been buying online since then."

The extraction site seems to be healing fine, but I have noticed a big dark brown spot on the side of the tooth right next to it. This spot would have been covered before, by the tooth I had extracted. \n\nSo now I'm serioulsy worried that this is a cavity.\n\nAlso, as the spot is quite dark and large it would have been impossible for my dentist to miss this while extracting the tooth right next to it, right? So would the fact that he didn't mention it during the extraction indicate that this might be tartar? \n\nI will definitely see my dentist after the Christmas holidays, but for now I'm just looking for an early opinion.\n\nI have also uploaded a photo, any help would be appreciated.\n\n\nThanks\nTobias KVMCruces: I'm not a dentist but I do work in the dental field and that looks more like decay than anything. Could be a cavity but doesn't look like tartar. Its odd that your dentist didn't mention it but I would just talk to your dentist about it when you go back in for a visit."

Two days ago, I noticed that I had a hole in my tooth and I believe it's some sort of tooth decay/cavity and I'm really concerned about this right now. I asked my mom and sister if they can notice it but they can't see anything at all, even the hole. My sister thinks all of my teeth are fine, but my mom thinks I need braces for my teeth, because they are not straightened well. I am trying to tell my sister to make a dentist appointment, but she's too busy with work all day tomorrow, plus my mom can't speak English very well, while I'm only a minor and I heard that I can't make appointments by myself until I'm 18. We also have financial issues and it's going to be tough for us. Here are the pictures of the tooth. The first picture was taken just now and the second picture was taken 2 days ago. KVMCruces: Looks more like a chip and not so much tooth decay but I would get still get a professional opinion from a local dentist.\nIt looks fairly small so I wouldn't stress it too much. If its decay they can probably just do a fill, if its a chip they can do bonding or inlay/onlay restoration. \nAs far as scheduling an appointment, as long as your parents agree to take you then I would just call the dentist office and schedule an appointment (just tell them youre scheduling for your sister). I wouldn't delay it too much though because it may just be a small problem but it can definitely turn into something bigger over time. Goodluck!"

I am in the exact same boat as you. In fact I could have written your post myself. I have spent countless hours on the internet researching and honestly it just makes me more confused. Where one website says one thing, another says the opposite. Thats why i figured i would turn to a forum hoping someone would relate to whats going on with me and have some insight. The question of dental vs. neurological has been driving me insane i cant figure it out!! Is there a way to know for sure? I have trouble accepting a “possibility” type of answer. My problem did start all of a sudden. I had extensive orthodontic work many years ago and never once had an issue or complaint. As far as i know that x ray is just standard but i have also done much research on more detailed xrays such as cone beam and the like. Its hard to find a place that even takes those x rays, nevermind a dentist who feels it is necessary to send me for one!! This has been such a nightmare. In your case, have you looked into possible teeth grinding, or bite problems as the cause of your pain? I hear that both can actually be extremely painful. Best of luck and once again thank you for the support and replies. If nothing else, we are not alone. John Roberts: I am sorry to hear other people are having this and can't get an answer. I like you am totally confused and don't know which way turn.  I have never had any orthodontist work done.  I had a crown put on my top back  (#2 I think ) 5 or 6 years ago and had the tooth below it refilled.  The dentist was supposed to do a root canal on it but didn't. (  That's another story) but other than that I haven't had any dental work done and wasn't having any trouble. Just a cleaning every 6 months.\nAll my problems started after that one visit.  Are basically all your teeth like this.  All mine are but the fronts top and bottom seem the worst.  I think I said the ones with crowns and root canals seem the worst.  I just don't have any faith in the dentist around here.  I did go to a dentist in a different town that supposedly has all the modern equipment, told her my problems and she didn't really do anything different than anyone else.  I told her about my teeth and that my bite did and does seem off.  Only thing she wanted to to was do a grinding type of adjustment  ( called a t scan or tech scan) and them make me another mouth guard.  She did recommend a sleep study to see if I grind my teeth.  I had one of those done and they said I have mild sleep apnea but I didn't or don't grind my teeth which I didn't think I did.  I really don't think my bite is off that much it is just that my teeth hurt so bad when they come together it magnifies my bite.  I really don't think bite is my problem but I am not sure.\nLets try and keep this going and maybe someone can help up out.  Maybe a good dentist will read it and have a suggestion.  The one neurologist I went to (  which I didn't care for ) said it was dental but I still don't believe it bit I don't know.  Only thing he did was have a mri on my head done and that was his conclusion\nI have read tons of pages on fluoride and I don't know if it has anything to do with what I have but I suspect it.  It is just to strange that all this happened after I had the fluoride treatment. I suspect that it penetrated my gums and has did something to my teeth.  It is a fact that it will penetrate your gums.\nLet me know if you find out anything.  By the way I am a 71 year old male and live in Louisiana."

I have an issue with veggies so I'm slowly trying to eat them...\n\nhowever I did go to the dentist today and got a cleaning for my plaque, its been years.....\nso I bled a lot etc, the dentist really didn't say anything except from I should brush my molars better.\nI'll go get a proper checkup next time.\n\nBeware its not the prettiest picture !

Your bite can't be comfortable because of the alignment and that can make teeth sensitive/gums recede.  You should see an orthodontist.  Maybe they can find a plan that works for you.  Orthodontics has risks but you have a case where the alternative is just as risky to long term dental health.

Hello! thanks for the reply, I'll go see an orthodontist and see if I can get braces, I doubt it because my family is living paycheck to paycheck and I'll be going to college soon, I do want them once I become an adult 4~5 years later, I hope my teeth and gum line will hold till then \n\nI used to brush very hard and long so I fixed that but I didn't know that my bite could cause the receding, what made it lower so suddenly after 1 cleaning?\nor did I just never notice it? Busybee: The gum looks sore and inflamed.  Your diet and lifestyle affect your gums.  So if you don't eat enough vitamin C they can get inflamed.  Have a kiwi fruit once a day, don't eat fast food.  Smoking is really bad for them.   Getting enough exercise, having a balanced diet (with some vitamin C so either fruit or veg, vitamin D seafood, dairy products etc), good hygiene (don't attack the gums but don't avoid them, use a soft brush).   Gums can heal but you may have a hereditary condition so check if your parents had receding gums.  If so then you will need to see a periodontist every few months for a special clean. DannyRyu: I'll be careful about treating my mouth better.\nSo my bad rabbits caused this recession and I didn't notice it or is it related to the plaque cleaning I got?\nand if so is there nothing that can be done with the current recessed gums, all I can do is prevent it? Busybee: I doubt vert much your cleaning caused it.  More likely the gum was inflamed before you went and the cleaning just took it down to where it already was.   To prevent it gettting worse maintain good hygiene (but don't over brush or be too hard as that is no good either), have a healthy diet with no fast food and plenty of vit D, calcium and vit C foods (but not loaded with acidic fruits or sugar), check your parent's history with gums and if they have a problem see a periodontist.  A decent sonic or braun electric toothbrush may help (it helped my gums).  All hygiene is good as long as you follow instructions and don't overdo it.

Busybee: It would be because you neglected hygiene and had a poor diet.  Or it could be hereditary.   Some people are more susceptible to gum disease than others because of their heritage.   If your parents have problems you may have inherited the same.  If not then looking after your teeth and gums going forward should help you avoid any future problems.

You could have veneers or composite to try to build up 6 and 7 but why put your teeth through this?  It will weaken what you have and you won't achieve perfect symmetry.  It's just not worth the maintenance issues and long term loss of function that a veneer causes.  You no longer have the strong biting surface and they chip.   I think you have a lovely smile.  If you do anything just go for composite build up.  This destroys the least tooth material.  Do not try to  move your mid line.  It's not worth it.  Do not go for orthodontics.  It can lead to complications on your bite and something horrible called root resorption if you are very unlucky.  You also have to wear a retainer at night for life. \n\nTake it from me, this is not the reason for your problems in life and you should smile with confidence.  I had a whole tooth missing because of a dentist and I had to have cosmetic work.  If I could go back in time I'd never have had veneers or crowns.

I too have problems with biting as well, i guess it's because of my midline misaligning that is why i'm trying to correct it. Also, what do you mean by composite build up? Is this chipping my longer tooth to make it level with others?\n\nAs you said, veeners are not as you recommended because it chips, but will putting up braces will solve my issues to align all my teeth? I also dont mind if i need to wear retainers my whole life. There may be consequences to this but i just dont feel confident with my smile that's why i'm giving efforts for them to be fixed. Busybee: Hi, composite is just a sticky resin that they use for white fillings, but which can also be used like modelling clay to change the shape of front teeth to make them longer or wider.  \n\n I would not recommend letting anyone adjust your canine teeth.  They are really important teeth and you will really notice the difference if you let anyone drill into them. \n\nI'm just letting you know that there are risks and that things can go wrong with any dental procedure.   Orthodontics can sometimes change the shape of your face and change your bite for the worse and some people are unhappy after treatment for that reason.   \n\nWhatever you decide to do don't rush into it, get a number of opinions from dentists and ask them about all the risks.  Too many dentists rush into treatment and then cannot fix the problems they create.   You have lovely healthy teeth which are precious and artificial dental work can never fully replace what nature creates."

I'm not sure whether I should try to go through with the root canal and spend the money or get the molar extracted and possibly an implant in the future when I can afford it. My one thing is, is my wisdom teeth haven't came in on this side. If I get the molar extracted, is it possible that my back molar would move forward and close the gap partially to let the wisdom tooth move in. I'm trying to make sure I make the right decision, but quick, as the pain is not lessening. Advice would be greatly appreciated."

I'm approaching 50 and have had a lot of dental work done in my teens.\n\nInitially I had crowns, which eventually broke and I've now had a couple of bridges for 5 years. They're fine but I treat them with kid gloves and retrained myself to eat with my premolars & molars.\n\nSo, my first problem came about 5 years ago when I needed a crown removed and for a short period of time I had a denture which I could not get on with. It made my mouth sore and I suffered with oral thrush quite a lot. After some persuasion I managed to get my dentist to do a bridge on the NHS. (They initially refused to do it). They told me at the time that they were not prepared to do any further 'cosmetic' surgery.\n\nI've had problems with an upper left tooth recently. It was root treated a long time ago (10 years +) and had a large filling in it. As I've had to change the way I eat, my molars & premolars work harder now and inevitably the filling has come out.\n\nThe dentist has now referred me to a specialist; they say that the root treatment has failed/is failing and that it will need to be done again, which they cannot do. \n\nMy question is... is this normal, OR is this my dentist refusing to do further treatment as previously suggested? Is this specialist treatment? apl789: you're lucky they have referred you, as normally they will pull the tooth out on the nhs.\nPrivate root canal....cost circa £1000\nnhs root canal.........cost circa £60\nthey would be making a loss doing a RC on the nhs, and no one likes to make a loss."

I have an appointment in a couple of weeks to start the process of getting dentures. \nHowever, my jaw is absolutely killing me. \nI've always been a bit of a teeth grinder, even while awake, thanks to my anxiety disorder. Most of the time, I'd simply have my jaw sort of 'locked' together, and that's how my mouth would rest. Now, without upper teeth to rest against, I feel like my lower jaw is getting more and more cramped, like it's actually being strained. This, in addition to the lovely side effects of chemo, has me stressed out to the max, causing me even more pain. \n\nSo my question, simply, is this, because hours of searching on google has yielded nothing: Is there some sort of mouth guard that I can get so that my lower jaw has something to work/rest against rather than just sort of hanging free? Or is there something I can do to alleviate the pain? I feel like I'm going nuts, between the jaw pain and my tongue being sore from the chemo. DrGargsDentalClinic: There is nothing to be scared about it. It is just tooth healing process and is normal after the wisdom tooth treatment.

Ever since then I’ve been having pain in a tooth in between two teeth that got fillings. The tooth that hurts was deemed perfectly healthy. Is it possible that the fillings or all of the bite alterations somehow moved this tooth? It feels like it’s hitting the tooth under in (another healthy tooth). But the dentist says that it’s not hitting down on the tooth under it, he said it is just touching the tooth under but it feels like it’s hitting because the tooth is already in pain. He said that it may be cracked and if that’s the case I will need a root canal. I maxed out on my insurance with the 10 fillings and really can’t afford to go to the orthodontist that he referred me to out of pocket. Should I just believe him that it’s not hitting the bottom tooth and fork over the $2k for a root canal so that I don’t have to pay the orthodontist plus root canal?

Dentist now says its got to go and implant is the best option.\n\nImplant costs £2000 and is only available privately. Bridge would be available on NHS (and would cost £190). I asked why a bridge wouldn't be an option and the dentist said they are not as good and might come off and an implant is more permanent.\n\nInterestingly, they didnt say no to the bridge. Makes me think they are being a little evasive because saying no would be a lie...\n\nI am wondering whether the actual cost of the treatment is swaying it for the dentist. £2000 or £190. I know for a fact that they are not keen on NHS work (I think in the uk they are forced to do this).\n\nAppreciate a bridge only lasts a limited time but £190 or £2000 is a bit of a difference.... Robert Tucker: On the web, the current NHS band 3 course of treatment, which include bridges, is £244.30.\n\nIf you have a bridge it will mean that part of the teeth on either side of the current defective tooth will need to be drilled away. You thus have two teeth weakened and a more difficult task keeping them clean and infection free while you have a weaker structure compared to a good sound successful implant.\n\nWhile looking at implants, you may want to compare titanium implants with all zirconium ones if you can find a dentist in your area who will use the latter.

Some (many?) dentists will point out that a bridge has the natural \"suspension\" from the teeth supporting it so feels more natural when you chew. Also if the neighbouring teeth are already crowned/capped, you possibly won't need to have  much (anything) more removed from them. If you have an implant you need a hole drilled in your jaw bone, of course.\n\nBut a good successful implant may last twice as long or longer than a bridge and if you have it done soon after the extraction (or other loss of the tooth) you won't have gum recession and bone loss (from the alveolar ridge) which could lead to paying several hundred pounds more if you later decide to have an implant.\n\nIf a tooth needed to come out as a result of some accident totally beyond your control or as a result of some severe illness, then you might get an implant on the NHS. Maybe the philosophy is that if people enjoy the luxury of confectionery, they should pay up for implants – but then if most of the decay occurred during school years and considering the extra non-dental health costs of those who tend to like to indulge more in culinary delights altogether... I'm not too sure why a sugar tax shouldn't be workable."

The tooth without pain relief will ache until the decay breaches the foramen, the blood supply is shut off to the pulp in the tooth and the pulp nerve becomes necrotic. You then have a highly infected tooth which is almost certainly going to produce pus and your system will not be able to close off (calcify) the foramen. The pus will create an abscess and eventually probably other \"holes\" in your gum if not eventually in your cheek and beyond. The abscess may cause a little or great pain (especially when you bite on the tooth). The pus may also damage the foramen when you may then need surgery cutting open the gum to treat it. The dentine in the tooth will be subject to (further) erosion from the pus and from acids from bacterial action on sugars in the mouth. You will also be at risk of septicemia (blood poisoning) which can be quite serious.\n\nI did have a tooth where a leaking amalgam filling had allowed the pulp to become infected, and which I'd allowed to continue exuding pus through the gum for about 8 years, finally treated. It was done in more than one stage with a few weeks between the stages (not 3 months).\n\nI think the success rate for a root canal treatment is 90+% on a good day.\n\nIf you can clean the tooth, swish it round with a good strong mouthwash, rub salt on it, or put a little swab of cotton wool soaked in clove oil on it and the pain goes and stays gone (unless you eat something – which you don't do), maybe you'd only need a conventional filling, but if you've left aching for 5 days and you've gone to a good dentist ... Robert Tucker: Actually, if the decay hasn't reached the roots, maybe it's possible, in theory at least, just to have the pulp cavity clean out and filled. I did have two roots of a three-rooted tooth molar root-filled and the third was sealed off with a lining. It may be necessary to be ready for some pain, or the approach of pain – the dentist is going to want to know that the nerves in the roots are still live. The drill is the most effective way of ascertaining this, but there are electrical methods – maybe you could have the pulp chamber cleared out and then when the anaesthetic wears off, an electrical test. If you brave that, you will want the lining, you do not want a composite filling chemically killing off a live nerve, believe me."

Or for that would I have to stop drinking cola all together?\n\nNote;- I do drink a lot of soda/cola (maybe 500ml a day) norweger: I'm not a dentist, but my two cents are this:\n\nWhen you drink soda your teeth becomes temporarily weaker by the acid. So if you drink soda and then brush (within some 30-60 minutes after drinking), your teeth might get damaged. So don't drink then brush immediately afterwards.\nIf you want to continue drinking soda after you brush, you should drink some water afterwards, or even better do something to get your spit production up (have a sugarfree gum or a slice of cheese), as spit is the best protection against acidic drinks.\nCoke, tea, coffee, wine and berries are part of an ordinary life. I think it's best to just live like you wish, and then if you'd like white teeth, whiten them once in a while. Perhaps once or twice a year.\nMy answers are assuming you don't drink \"heavy coke\", i.e. sugared coke. If you do, then I would most definitely recommend using a fluoride mouth wash afterwards. After all, your teeth are already clean from the brushing, so all they need is fluoride.\n\nDiscoloration is easy to reverse.\nAcid damage is hard to reverse. \n\nIf I've got it right, what happens when you drink sugar is that the bacteria feeds of the sugar and creates acidic pockets in the teeth, so the cavities are actually caused by the acid."

Also in the morning there is some discomfort but this subsides within an hour or two. \n\nAs of now, i can get by just fine but i'm starting to think if its a nerve in the tooth thats dying and that i may need a root canal? \n\ntrouble is i can't actually tell which tooth it is. \n\nWhen i floss as mentioned above, the gum hurts quite a bit, which makes me think i may have a gum infection of some sort?\n\nAny help will be appreciated. \n\nThe current dentist i'm with has 2 x rays of my teeth and cannot see any issues at all. Should i try a different dentist altogether? calcium48: It is difficult to know EXACTLY where a pain eminates from.\nwhats your age? calcium48: nothing will or can be as good as your natural teeth, so you should always try and keep them. Will save you a lot of pain and discomfort. DSH694: calcium48 said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIt is difficult to know EXACTLY where a pain eminates from.\nwhats your age? I'm 23 years old, why do you ask? Zuri Barniv: A gap between the teeth causes problem. When food packs in there it can cause your symptoms and they do come and go. Consider trying a WaterPik or flossing carefully twice a day and rinsing after meals. Do this for a week and see if your symptoms go away. If they do, go find a more competent dentist that knows how to do fillings without leaving a gap.\nDr. Barniv"

However, recently I have been suffering with an abscess in the top left gum which had developed into a lump at the top of my gum.  I previously had a filling in the tooth and he did say that eventually it would need a crown but gave no indication as to when or when I should think about having it, as I could not afford it at the time and I was not in pain I did not think anything more.  \n\nAn abscess developed and he gave me antibiotics which cleared it again saying at some point a crown needed but no indication of when again as before I could not afford it at the time and not in pain so carried on.  Recently, at the beginning of September I had pain again so went to see him, an abscess had formed and I was given antibiotics which took the pain away but not the swelling, I decided at this point to have the crown done and I was provided a treatment plan and started the treatment.  After these antibiotics the pain had gone but the swelling was still there but it wasn't causing any pain so I assumed the abscess had gone and the dentist had done a few x days so I assumed all was OK for the treatment to be done. the root canal has been done but the abscess is still present. During one appointment to clear the last root he injected the anisthetic into the abscess I suffered pain immediately and from then on I have had pain and 2 lots of antibiotics but it has not cleared.  anyway, on my appointment today I felt he was patronising in how he spoke with me he never offered up options on what could be done now just kept asking me what I wanted him to do Im not qualified so I asked him to do whats best and his response was nothing is for the best at this stage take it out or carry on trying to clean it out.  From then on his attitude offended me and i drove back to work in floods of tears and im not a crier! I feel our patient/dentist relationship has broken down as I don't feel I get enough information from him, he never provides options for treatment first and puts down my suggestions when I try and make some ill informed ones with the little information I have from him. Im looking to speak with the practice manager about it because it has upset me and I'm getting frustrated and don't want to go back to him. Is it wise to change dentists mid treatment or would it be best to complete my treatment and raise my issues then? I don't want to cause a further rift if I have to go back to him.

    "dialogue": "MrMister: Good day folks,\n\nMy experiences with UK NHS dentists have been getting worse and worse. Nowadays, when I get a filling done, it seems that the chances of it lasting two weeks are slim. I have moved from NHS dentist to NHS dentist, several times in recent years, looking for one who inspires confidence. I finally thought I had found one, but the latest filling I had done was on a front tooth, after which, the dentist advised me not to eat apples without cutting them up first. I followed this advice, yet the filling fell off within three days! I was eating soft food when it fell off.\n\nI had hoped this dentist was better than average for the NHS, but on this occasion, several things about my treatment session troubled me. I had advised the dentist of my anxieties about dentistry, yet my teeth were drilled without anesthetic, and when I flinched, out of sheer terror, I was reprimanded sternly! To add to my anxieties, the dentist was gossiping with her assistant during the procedure, about matters unrelated to the dentistry. I'm sure I'm not alone in feeling that a dentist cannot be giving full attention to his/her work while conversing about unrelated matters.\n\nWhen I had a broken front tooth repaired back in 1979, on the NHS, the filling lasted 35 years! That's quite a difference from 3 days, despite, presumably, the improvement in dental techniques and materials of recent decades. Would I be correct to conclude that my current dentist is sub-standard? Would I be justified in lodging a complaint?\n\nMany thanks..."

    "dialogue": "tinyfoot: Hi guys, ever since my baby teeth dropped out and my adult took there places I've had huge problems with my teeth. I was living in the UK at the time so I had all of my dental work and orthodontics done by the NHS. They classed me as a category 5 patient, category 5 being the worst and most severe category for teeth. My teeth were very bad, deformed and not aligned at all. I remember always having to close my mouth and smile when ever I had any pictures taken of me because they were that ugly. \n\nAnyway eventually I was old enough to have braces (train tracks) put on to my teeth and within a couple years my teeth were pretty much perfect and aligned just like everyone else in my class at the time. My orthodontist took off my braces when I was 16 years old and said that when you are 18 years old your teeth shouldn't move anymore and they will be stuck in place. She tried to glue some wire on the back of my teeth to keep them in place, however this glue would keep coming off only a few days after i had seen her. So she gave me a retainer and told me to wear it during the day and night since the glue for the wire kept coming undone. Eventually I was about 17 and half years old and I went to see her for my last appointment, by this time I'd known her for about 6-7 years now. She discharged me from her care and told me that I shouldn't need to wear the retainer anymore. I was thrilled, the horrors of my childhood teeth were behind me and I felt really good with my teeth now. \n\nWhen I turned 18 years old I moved to Thailand to be with my mum. I noticed that slowly my teeth had been moving so I put the retainer back in my mouth when I went to bed at night and this seemed to stop them moving and kept them in place. Now I'm 22 years old and about 5 months ago my retainer broke. So I stopped putting it in my mouth at night, since that time my teeth have been moving again and it looks like they're moving back to there old position where they were before I had the train track braces put in. We've been to several dental clinics in Phuket, Thailand to see what their advice is. They all said that same thing which is that I need to have reconstructive jaw surgery to have my lower jaw moved forward, this is because I have a big under bite. The reason for that they said is because when I was younger I had about 4 teeth removed from my lower jaw to make room for the train track braces which I remember. They went on to say, however the dentist should have given you an injection to help promote the growth of your lower jaw and chin; which I remember they never did. They all said the same things, that I need to have this surgery done first before they can sort my teeth out. \n\nThis is my story. My question is what should I do now? Please feel free to write any advice you'd give me in my situation Dipsey: Depends how much it affects you and do you have the money for extensive surgery. Thai oral surgeons are very good most have all the latest technology for very good reconstruction. Without a retainer though your teeth will be on the move."

He performed a root canal on a front tooth actually on 3 of my front teeth but the most recent one he did last week, he hand filed all the way up to the floor of my nose and filled it with gutta percha AND cotton. I left in 10x more pain than I had arrived. He never took ONE X-ray. Not before, not during, and not after. I went back 3 days later, hurting, and begging for an X-ray where he found infection above the tooth next to the one he just did and he had gone through the apex of that tooth as well, but not nearly as much. He tried convincing me to let him do an apicoectomy to clean the infection out and I decided to seek an oral surgeon which is how I found out about the nightmarish work that was done in my mouth.. I've now had those two root canals retreated and need another retreat done on a third as well as crowns on my front teeth. I want my old dentist to cover these expenses and I don't think he should be practicing dentistry anymore.. I would love anyone's opinions on this. I'll post a photo, it's so bad.. thank you.\n\nSide note: I also want to add that he put a crown over a massive cavity in my fathers mouth.

I expressed my concern about the tooth next to the removed as it was very wobbly and painful but she said it was fine and prescribed more antibiotics because the last lot had done nothing. 3 days ago the wobbly tooth came out!! there was no pain but the next day my mouth was more swollen and extremely painful with the swelling spreading to under this site and the next tooth as well. now the antibiotic are nearly all gone and the infection is still present and if anything getting more painful. Do you know why the infection will not clear?There is still small fragments of bone in the original how and seems to be some bone from the new hole sort of touching the tooth next door and it kind of feels as though this a chip out of the root nextdoor as the root i can get to with my tongue is sharp and has a bit missing. the gap between the tooth and this bone fragment is no more than 2mm and if i get my thumb nail between the two there is extreme pain. Could the tooth coming out have damaged the next tooth's root? i dont know what to do im going out of my mind with the pain. There is a lump on my jaw bone under the removal site that is also massively painful and the pain radiates up my jaw both side. Do you have any idea what this may be? when i asked my dentist she didnt seem too interested. I feel as though i have been given a thorougher beating on the left side of my face. i have been in agony now for 6 constant weeks and really dont know how much more i can take. my dentist has now stipulated she wont see me unless i see the hygienist first but i cant afford to at this moment and i dont think i could anyway because of the pain. please help me if you can im in agony. Dipsey: You shouldn't be poking your tongue in the holes makes things worse. Get hold of some MMS chlorine dioxide and use twice a day as a mouth wash.

I found this odd since neither of the teeth were in any pain, yet my own reading online convinced me that not all teeth that require root canals will in pain. I went ahead with the procedure since I am eager to get braces and my dentist told me he could not give me clearance to do so unless I had the root canals.\n\n I took fresh x-rays right before my procedure, yet I could not help but feel questionable on what the X-rays showed. Of course I questioned my dentists and the assistants, yet they persisted they were the correct teeth and I still needed root canals.\n\nPlease view the attached photo. The two teeth that required root canals are circled in red. Can someone point out to me exactly where decay is shown? Because they look just like my surrounding teeth, which didn't need root canals. (Please ignore my childish Snapchat caption on the photo, lol). I guess I thought a root canal meant all the black area in the tooth should be grey, indicating bacteria?\n\nJust inquiring for a peace of mind since I spent A LOT of money on the procedures. Thanks in advance for your input! vancouverdentist: Eden,\n\n#13 is a second premolar and #14 is a first molar.\nThe two teeth show very big shadows which are indicative of decay (indicated by shadows that originate from outside of tooth).\nThe decay on these two teeth are very close to the nerves (indicated by shadows inside the tooth).\nAlthough it requires both x-rays and clinical exam to determine the necessary treatment plan, looking at the x-rays alone, root canal treatment on the two teeth sound very reasonable.\n\nHope this helps. Dipsey: A root canal should only be done for pain management when all else fails. A good clean with antibiotics and fresh filling can often save a tooth for decades without having a root canal done."

    "dialogue": "Doggy: Hey,\n\nSo, going back roughly 5 years ago, half of one of my back left molars broke. Half of the tooth is still there, but the other half is exposed gum/pieces of the tooth. Fortunately, this never caused me any pain, bad breath or anything similar, until recently. Starting from just a few days ago, the tooth has had a pretty nasty smell. I am still not experiencing any pain, but it is just resulting in me having bad breath. I have been brushing my teeth several times a day/after each meal, avoiding soda, etc.\n\nI have gone as far as applying tooth paste directly to the tooth and rubbing it around that way instead of just flying over it with a brush, hoping to eliminate the smell, but with no luck. I know Googling things like this will most likely not help, but from everything I have read, I don't know what it could be. Most common things I see online should also have me in pain.\n\nI am 18 (Not overly sure if that is relevant to the situation) and haven't been to the dentist in a long time. Even just the idea of a dentist gets me anxious, so the idea of actually having work done freaks me out, haha. calcium48: if the tooth is broken you will need to see a dentist. vancouverdentist: Doggy,\n\nPain does not always correlate with the severity of tooth damage. \nFor example, once the nerve inside the tooth dies, there will no longer be pain on the tooth itself.\nHowever, if the tooth is left alone without a treatment, the surrounding gum/bone may develop a problem as a result.\nI would strongly recommend visiting a dentist for an assessment and treatment.\nIn regards to your anxiety, sedation is a great option to keep you comfortable during treatments.\n\nHope this helps. Dipsey: The tooth is infected you can try MMS  chlorine dioxide and dip brush in that twice a day will take down the smell and infection till you find a dentist."

One of the spots was really painful so they went back in and removed bone and debris. That was about 10 days ago.\n\nThe two spots they didn't reoperate on healed and stopped hurting in a week. The place they did have to open stills hurts considerably. Due to some other medical conditions I can only take ibuprofen for about a week while they lower the dose of another med. Due to the pain I was on the ibuprofen for 2 weeks, but have had to stop taking it to resume my primary medication in its full strength. \n\nI brush around it and use a water syringe to clean the area in pain and it bleeds. I accidentally made contact with a toothbrush, force of habit, and it bled considerably. \n\nIf I could take ibuprofen that would help control the pain, not completely but enough to be tolerable, but since I cant what can I do? I am taking thee extra strength tylenol every four hours, but that's not helping. I was told not to use oragel.\n\nSo to summize, should I be in this much pain in the area that was reoperated on, and what can I do for the pain if I'm already taking large doses of Tylenol and can't take ibuprofen and have been told not to use oragel?\n\nThe dentist said the pain would lessen after a couple of days but it has not, and I can feel the pain all the way in my sinus. The doc said it was other teeth causing the pain, but it's just that one area that hurts. One tooth right next to it was sensitive when he pushed on it, but that was it.\n\nSorry for being so long winded. I wanted to give as much detail as possible.

First of all, I’m from Portugal and english is not my native language, so forgive me if I make some mistakes, I’ll try to make myself clear.\n\nIn four days I will get two of my wisdom teeth removed (left side). I already took out the two on the right side. The thing is:\nMy face isn’t symmetrical, my upper jaw seems to be a little more to the right side, I have a marked gummy smile and some of the characteristics of the Adenoide Facies, I think, as I have always been a mouth breather - but no one ever diagnosed me with that, although an orthodontist once told me about ortognatic surjery to correct my asymmetry and gummy smile. She told me it was nothing severe, but if I wanted to, this would be the only way to correct this problems. Maybe because of all this I started researchig and noticing that it seems like my cheeks are flat, not chubby at all, and that my face is too thin and long.\n\nSO… I’m worried that extracting this two wisdom teeth will make my face look even thinner, and improve the cavity I have on the left side (wich is more prominent than the one I have on the right side, probably because my jaw is diverted (?). I never noticed any difference on the right side after I removed the wisdom teeth, but I was not so careful as I am now, back then – as I said, the right side is not so thin as the left side, even without the wisdom teeth, and this makes me hopeful that removing the ones from the left side won’t make my appearence change for the worse.\n\nTo complete, here’s some more info: My wisdom teeth are/were all “within” the gums, sloping, almost lied down, and the last one I took out was even a bit “inside” the bone. So, they are all completely covered.\nI wear braces, and the reason I need to take out the wisdom teeth is only preventive, but my dentist says it’s very important to remove them, so I won’t get in trouble in future. \n\nI have some photos, I don’t know if they can help in some way, but I can upload them if necessary (they are mirrored, because they are selfies!!). calcium48: Your English is good.\ngood idea to remove the wisdom teeth."

I'm familiar with it, I've had it on several occasions in the past for dental procedures so I know what it's supposed to do, but it absolutely nothing. I told the dentist and he said \"that's impossible, it's set to 50%\".  Any idea what might have gone wrong? He charges for it and I don't mind paying but I don't want to pay for nothing. I'm not sure if it's relevant but I'm 70 I don't drink, smoke or take any drugs prescription or otherwise.  \n\nThe dentist apologized for having to charge for it but said it had gotten expensive since a nitrous factory blew up somewhere. Could it be that his new source is selling crappy nitrous? Ron Katyal DDS: Some people Nitrous doesn't have a profound effect on like myself. You can try a higher concentration next time ( up to 70%) or you can opt for other methods of sedation. Or he could have a leak somewhere in the lines if it is not a portable unit.\n\nBut he was telling you the truth about the nitrous plant explosion.  Hope this helps LMB: I got an email that Dr. Katyal had replied to my post but the response seems to be missing unless I'm doing something wrong here.  This was the message:\n       \"Some people Nitrous doesn't have a profound effect on like myself.

I am seeing two dentists on Wednesday 8/23 (my general dentist and an Oral Surgeon) and want to know ahead of time is this price a lure or what can I expect my costs to be. I do have insurance that will cover $1500 of anything that I get done, but know this is the tip of the iceberg I think. Don_Colorado: Given my estimate today. $8800 US dollars here in Denver. This is just for the oral surgeon to do his part. The bridge or crown combo would be another $4,000. MetLife doesn't cover implants so most would be out of pocket.

(i get a lot of food stuck between my teeth)\n\nMy dentist of many years told me they'd do the fillings and fill in the contacts while they were in there. \nBefore i could have the work done my insurance changed and I had to try a new dentist for the fillings. This new dentist said he could do the fillings and fix the contacts but his method is to remove any previous fillings in the teeth and replace them completely versus patching/filling. He said this is the way he does fillings and has for 35 years. \nThese fillings he would be removing are pretty deep fillings, that were rather painful to get done the first time and span 5 teeth (3 on 1 side and 2 on the other).  He wants to do it in two sessions so I do one side at a time.\n\nIs this common practice to drill out any previous filling and redo them completely? or is patching the tooth/filling more standard? \n\nany insight would be greatly appreciated!"

    "title": "Pressure sensitivity, and my dentist is stumped.",
    "dialogue": "Mecidimes: Hey everyone, I'm not usually one to ask for advice online, but honestly my dentist and endodontist are both stumped.\n\nI had my first cavity last December, and it was filled with silver by my home dentist. A few weeks later, I had pressure sensitivity on that tooth to the point that I couldn't chew on it. The pressure sensitivity has always been on the lift-off, never on the bite-down. No temp sensitivity or lingering pain. I saw a big dental practice in another city and the dentist told me the tooth had three cracks in it radiating away from the filling toward the mesial, buccal, and lingual sides of the tooth. She recommended a crown, to which I grudgingly agreed (I'm 24 with no history of dental problems other than misalignment corrected with braces).\n\nThey installed the temporary and the pressure sensitivity was much worse. Again, no temperature sensitivity or lasting pain. I kept that in for a month and they went ahead and put on the permanent porcelain blend crown. However, they put a microfracture in it as it was being installed so they said I needed to have it replaced eventually (at no charge). However, at this point they were saying that with my continued pressure sensitivity, I may need a root canal or even an implant.\n\nWith the permanent crown on, the pressure sensitivity decreased quite a bit but is still there. They keep filing it down to take it more out of bite, but yet the pain persists. So they checked the integrity of my pulp with a really cold probe, and that was normal. They checked it using an electric conduction probe, and that was diminished. So they sent me to an endodontist.\n\nThe endodontist looked at my X-rays and told me he couldn't see any fracture at all; maybe just a little widening of one of the ligaments. He also said that the electric conduction probe doesn't make any sense because the crown doesn't conduct electricity anyway. He didn't feel a root canal was necessary and recommended conservative therapy.\n\nSo now I'm in a bit of a cycle. I stay off the tooth completely for a week, and it calms down to the point that I can eat almost half a meal with no tenderness. However, then the tenderness comes back and I have to start all over again.\n\nTooth doctors! Have you seen anything like this before? How do I get my tooth to stop hurting? medf: Hello, Mecidimes. I see you haven't gotten any responses yet. This board seems to be pretty inactive, unfortunately. Have you gotten any advice elsewhere? I posted a message shortly after yours about a similar problem my wife is having and haven't gotten any responses either. My post focused on her bite problem but she has pressure sensitivity in the tooth as well. Her first dentist suggested she may need a root canal but the endodontist he sent her to says he doesn't think she needs one and her pain is \"within normal range\" whatever that means. Unlike you, however, her tooth is also sensitive to cold. It was a rather deep filling but not too close to the nerve from what we're told. At this point we're stuck and she's very upset about it. She hasn't been able to chew on that side for over four months since she had the filling done. The pain isn't excruciating and doesn't linger, but it's uncomfortable enough for her to not want to chew on it. She just wants her old cavity-having tooth back at this point as she never had pain in it until it got filled. I really hope we can get some answers! Mecidimes: I did get one response from another forum (the name of which escapes me; I just googled \"dentistry forums\" or some such thing and picked the first three or four). They recommended watchful waiting.\n\nI've had pressure sensitivity since late January of this year, but it's only been in the last couple of weeks in which it's actually gotten better! Now the pressure sensitivity is almost gone and I can chew on it again. I will need another crown put on that tooth eventually since the current one is cracked, but I think I'm done monkeying around with my mouth for now.\n\nThe week that started this recovery was the week after I saw my endodontist, who prescribed me 800mg ibuprofen (four normal tablets) every 6 hours for a week, as well as strict avoidance of any chewing on that side. He made a very good analogy about my tooth basically being a sprained ankle, and to treat it as such. At the end of that week, I did feel better but it still hurt. I'm about three weeks out now and the pain has gotten progressively better. Maybe try that? I hope that helps! medf: Thanks for the info. So basically, you had pressure sensitivity for 6 months and only after the ibuprofen did it manage to heal? That's interesting because our endo said it could take up to 6 months for the discomfort to go away. We were skeptical because it's coming up on 5 months now since she had the filling. But maybe ibuprofen will help it along, so we'll try that. The other concern is her bite still feels off in that spot. They say there's no more room for adjustment but she can definitely still feel it hitting in one spot. We're going to another dentist who is supposedly good with functional occlusion, so hopefully he'll be able to do something.\n\nWhat a bummer this happened to you with your first cavity! Well, it sounds like things are improving for you so hopefully things will get back to normal."

The assistant did the filling, had me bite and grind, and removed what she needed to.  The thing was that I thought I felt her doing the same thing to the top tooth, when the filling was on the bottom.  I was numb so I couldn't tell for sure, but once I was no longer numb I could feel where this was done.\n\nSince then, I have had extreme pain where the work was done.  Eating something like a banana is noticeable, but anything harder than that is unbearable.  I can't drink anything cold on that side of my mouth now either, and issue that I didn't have before this was done.\n\nI went back in to have it looked at and the assistant looked at it, then called the Dentist in.  He was going to clear a high spot, and right after he started I felt an extremely sharp pain, and I shouted out a bit.  He said just a little more, and I had the same feeling, so I just asked him to stop.  I stood up and he said that is just the way fillings are.  They will hurt for a bit, and then the pain will subside.  If it doesn't, I would just need to use Sensodyne toothpaste.  I asked why it didn't hurt before I came in, but it does now. . . and I got a sort of, that is just how it is.  I left the room I was in, and stood around the corner.  I heard some mumbling, then laughing.  That is when I had enough, and just walked out.  \n\nI guess my question is, is this normal?  I have had fillings in the past, and have never had this much pain.  Even when they replaced all my old dark ones with the new white ones.  Also, is the assistant supposed to grind/drill a perfectly good tooth to make room for a filling she just put in?  I looked up her position on their website and she is a Dental Assistant / E.F.D.A.  She didn't make me feel comfortable when she did the filling, said she was done, then added more to the filling."

    "title": "Doxycycline Effect Enamel On My Babys Teeth - Given While Pregnant",
    "dialogue": "sasha_chappell: Hello Everybody\n\n\n\nI looking for some advice on my daughter’s teeth. Here is a short summery of what’s been happening.\n\nAt 24 weeks of my pregnancy I was prescribed doxycycline. The pregnancy went full term without any complication’s, she was born by C-section. My diet throughout the pregnancy has been healthy. I also have a 4-year-old son who has no problems with his teeth.\n\nWhen my daughter was 1 we noticed some marks on her teeth, almost like they had appeared overnight, we didn’t think much of if just thought she had chipped them by chewing a toy or something but arraigned an appointment with the dentist the next day.\n\nThe dentists first question was did you take any medication during pregnancy because the staining on the teeth look symmetrical and its only affecting the two front teeth, this is when I did some research into doxycycline and was horrified by what I found.\n\nNot only should this drug never be given to pregnant women but it can have a massive effect on the way the enamel forms to teeth.\n\nMy daughter now has no enamel on her two front teeth but they are crumbling away at an alarming rate. We have been to see a consultant who has advised us this is due to taking the drug at that time in my pregnancy because it’s the correct time when the font baby teeth are developing (no other teeth are effected at this time) and has referred us to a specialist to get a better diagnosis. He also reassured us that her adult teeth would highly unlikely be unaffected, and worse case if she got an infection in the gums and had to have the teeth removed this would not have any effect on her speech.\n\nDue to how busy the hospital is, the waiting times are too long to sit wait and do nothing for an appointment so we went private. The first dentist we saw said yes it’s to do with drug and she managed to get some varnish over what’s left of the teeth to try slow down the deterioration and prevent any pain she might have. She also said the best treatment would be to try and put glass ionomers over what’s left, but as Quona is so young this would tricky to do without putting her to sleep but this would be a big risk.\n\nWe then went to see a specialist in Harly street London and she has advised us to do nothing and pull the teeth when she gets an infection, and there really isn’t anything you can do but try and maintain a sugar free diet cut the meals down to 3 a day and brush regularly.

    "dialogue": "cryingaboutteeth: Hi. I'm a 27 year old woman. I had a root canal done about five years ago on my #31, and I messed up by not going back for the crown. They said they put in a permanent filling, though. Debris of food kept getting stuck between that and my #30 though, and one time a few months later I felt something snap while absently using a fork to pick at it. I checked it up with the dentist they told me it was fine, but I think some of the filling broke out though, not sure, and then I'm not sure when but I started noticing a horrible, fecal odor from the area. If I touch it with my tongue I can smell it on the tip of my tongue. I rub cotton between my teeth in that area and it smells awful. This has been going on for about four years. One time I massaged my gums and felt an awful salty taste in my mouth, dunno where that came from. Haven't been able to replicate it. I keep going to the dentists but they tell me nothing is wrong. At one point they noticed an abscess on the x-ray below the root canaled tooth, but it seems to be gone now. At one time I was put on antibiotics for a wisdom tooth extraction (which I didn't get done, but that's for another day) and the smell seemed to be temporarily gone. Recently I went to a dentist and they decided to place a crown on said tooth, and shaped it for the fitting. They told me the odor must be from the food getting stuck between that tooth and my #30, though I know the smell starts almost immediately when food (or even coffee) touches the area and I brush and floss as much as I can every day, to no avail. I asked them if my #30 was decaying/infected but they said no, though another dentist told me once that it was? They tell me they see no visible issues. The gap between both teeth is wider now from the reshaping, but the smell is still an issue, even if perhaps a little less than before. I keep sucking at it and feeling horribly gross. There's always a bitter taste in my mouth, my breath never feels fresh. I'm losing my mind and I don't know what to do. They tell me the x-ray looks fine, and there's no abscess now. Please please I'll take whatever advice you have. I gargle with chlorhexidine mouthwash now and then, but it doesn't help for long. Even if food gets stuck there for a short term, like maybe ten minutes, it smells awful when I floss it out.\n\nShould I let them place the crown? Would it help?"

This led to serious acid erosion which necessitated most of my teeth being filled with silver amalgam fillings. The only teeth I do not have fillings in are on the top the front two, and the two sets past them, and on the bottom, the front teeth (two front, and the 4 adjacent teeth).\n\nI had not been to a dentist for probably 5 years until a month ago. I had no insurance. I went to a dentist, they took x rays, told me what I already knew, which was that the only non filled back molars I had needed to be filled. This was to be expected, so they set up appointments. They got me a cleaning, which I had done yesterday, and an appt for the fillings on august 2nd. \n\nOn Monday, 2 days ago, I noticed that the two teeth adjacent to my front teeth on top each has a tiny black fleck on each side of them, which appeared to be on the gum, as it moved when I would push on the tooth with my tongue, or suck in saliva. It did not appear to be on either my front two teeth, but the gum. This has got me real worried. I take care of my teeth, brushing and flossing after every meal, so I dont see how this is happening. \n\nI went to the dentist yesterday, and the dental hygenist did the cleaning. I told her about the black spots, and she told me that the discoloring was most likely due to all the amalgam fillings in my mouth. However, what I have seen about amalgam tattoos and spotting, they look nothing like this. This is a tiny, plaque looking fleck. It;s on both sides of the tooth, right on the top of the gumline in between the teeth.\n\nI got home from the dentist, and these spots are still there. So, should I attempt to make another appointment to get these spots checked out even though she saw nothing wrong, or should I just wait the month until the appointment, and follow up then?\n\nNeither tooth is giving me pain in any way, it's just the the spots are making me worried.

The two dentists at the office were also unable to get it out usin floss and some thing to separate the teeth. The dentist could not see any issue on the x-ray, and suggested nothing was there. I could clearly feel something and couldnt understand why none of us were able to get the floss in between the teeth if there was nothing, so she suggested maybe the filling on the 2nd molar was not even and that it had a bad contactpoint. That filling was done less than a year ago, had not given me any issues. According to her it was taking that out, or going home. So she took it out, and as she did a small piece fell off the 1st molar where the floss had gotten stuck between the broken piece and the rest of the tooth. As she didnt have time to finish two fillings she left me with a gap between the teeth that she wanted to build out on the broken tooth(which was a very small piece, she said she maybe could see it on the x-ray afterwards). It was very uncomfortable, and she had left a pointy part that was annoying my tongue, so I got an appointment with the other dentist as she was occupied for the next couple of weeks. Now that its finished it feels a bit funny, like when I floss between those teeth its like the filling isnt even, the flossing gets broken, but not all the way and not stuck. Whats worse is I now feel pain in the 2nd premolar, in front of both of them, when I press down on it. It also feels slightly numb. I think possibly it has been left higher up than the two behind it? Or could my teeth have had time to shift in the two days I had a gap? What is the best fix, should I ask them to trim the premolar now? Or just wait it out, but could it cause a problem with the premolar if it gets too much pressure over time?\nIve also been wondering if another dentist would have been able to diagnose the actual problem without removing the first filling. I feel like its all been very invasice and expensive for an issue that in itself should have been small. I appreciate any inputs and help. Thank you in advance. Iwantittobeok: I am super aware of it all the time, its throbbin in a way, but not directly painful. Not sure how to handle this or wether I should let the same dentist do more work."

I went back to the dentist 8 days after the filling and he said he needed to make an \"adjustment\" and the pain should go away. He explained that sometimes if a filling is too big it will cause sensitivity and needs to be shaved down a little. He did this, there was a minor change in the pain level (maybe 20-30% less pain) but the pain still stayed. 7 Days later I went back again. He continued to adjust the filling shaving off more of the tooth, he took a good deal off and now the tooth with the filling feels pretty concave - as if a little of material was removed from the middle of the tooth - he said he wouldn't really want to remove anymore and that I should see if the pain goes back down before we trying anything else.\n\nIt is now 5 days after the 2nd adjustment and there is still pain. When he was doing the 2nd adjustment I noticed a very clear point of pain at one point on one of the teeth, it is a sharp pain at a very specific point.

When my braces were taken out it was extremely painful (I was literally crying in pain). They 'squeezed' my teeth the day before they were taken out with elastic bands so my teeth were super sensitive too, I think that's why it hurt so so much. Literally, the most painful thing that has ever happened to me. At the time, I thought it was normal, but then I read online and asked friends and apparently no one else felt pain or very minimal pain when they got their braces off. \n\nSo I have reason to believe that when my orthodontist was taking the braces off, this has caused the tooth to become yellow as it experienced trauma, and it has only started turning yellow after this. Today when I visited my orthodontist, he noticed the yellow tooth too, and he said that it was internal. (I didn't realise it was internal) and he asked if I had experienced any tooth trauma. I said that perhaps it was when my braces were removed and he dismissed it. (Someone else removed my braces - not him, so he didn't see me in that much pain). He suggested it was when I had my 2 supernumerary teeth removed, which was abovish where the yellow tooth is.

I've had braces three times during my life, and my teeth themselves are straight.. However, the last few years my smile is becoming more and more crooked. By crooked, I mean the right corner of my mouth lifts up more than the other corner This problem is more exaggerated sometimes and less others.\n\n I have attached a picture that shows a pretty bad time. It's a screen shot from a film. The right (reversed left) is what my smile used to look like on both sides. I also included a pic (with a hat) where I have a more normal smile (though it isn't quite right either). I have included both so you can compare. \n\n I am a performer and am regularly on camera, so this is of great concern to me. I do a lot of commercial work, and I don't want to lose. Also it is getting worse, and I am really concerned where it will be in ten years. I don't know whether I should go to a dentist or \"functional orthodontist.\" \n\nAlso, a note I am a vocalist and my voice teacher suspects I might have a mild form of TMJ (though I don't have a locking problems). I have tried to do some TMJ exercises (chin pressing up, massaging the jaw, etc), but it does not seem to help. \n\nI need a solution, \"just living with it\" is not acceptable, it's my livelihood and my smile used to be perfectly straight. Please advise. drmins: These photographs won't be sufficient in case diagnosis. A detailed examinations should be done. And yes, it can be corrected."

I could be wrong but it looks a few millimetres lower than my other teeth. My dentist is fantastic but at same time im disappointed how dismissive he seemed when i  last went. If i go back im extremely fearful he will say it will have to go as that is looking at considerable cost, over 2 months with a gap at front which i think would be awful and not to mention the considerable pain getting the root out.\n\nIt isnt really painful more annoying but at 7 weeks and counting i cant help thinking sooner rather than later it will develop into something really bad and doesnt seem to any sign of it clearing up.

    "dialogue": "Bananarama: It all started when I got two fillings on my left hand side done, one on the upper molar and one on #19. At first the fillings were pain free for 5 days, but one day I woke up from going to a concert (don't know if me dancing is relevant and did damage?) and #19 hurt horribly when chewing (upper one was fine.) I went to the dentist and got an adjustment and that only helped marginally. I went back around 5 more times and the pain became just a tiny area of pain in a certain part of the tooth when chewing crunchy or hard things. Then I got a sedative filling done at the beginning of the year and the pain stayed the same (its a tiny area on the tooth not the filling) I got x rayed and referred to an endodontist and he said I didn't have a crack, the filling was shallow and to let it chill out because root canal was overkill. Well I haven't taken out the sedative filling because I went to get more fillings done on the other side of my mouth. This time 2 on top 1 on bottom. Now the top ones hurt horribly, have gotten a couple adjustments and still hurt really bad. These are extremely sensitive to cold and forget about chewing pretty much most things. I'm extremely frustrated because my dentist and I are at a loss what to do. I can't afford a different dentist and she said seeing the endodontist for the other side at this point might be a waste of money. She had a feeling I was clenching so I bought a dental guard to sleep with and that didn't help either. She recommended one custom made but I don't know if that would help either at this point?

    "dialogue": "Ann: So for the past 19 days I have been facing one of my worst nightmares.  Until now I have never been afraid of going to the dentist but cautious due to  horror stories you hear.  I went in to get a bridge with an extraction, the extraction being tooth #30 so teeth 29 and 31 needed to be prepped for crowns to support the bridge I would need after the extraction.  The dentist began by prepping the crowns then was going to do the extraction.  Before he started the extraction I said that I had a tooth pulled on the opposite side previously and it was fused to the bone and it took a lot of muscle and almost 1 hour for the dentist to get it out.  The dentist said well this one will be simple it's not fused to the bone.  So he began prying, hammering, digging, pulling, etc on my tooth as he constantly had to switch sides.  After about 15 minutes I asked what the problem was and he just said he was working on it.  He continued working on the tooth for about 2 hours before he finally gave up because he couldn't get the roots out because they were fused to the bone!!!!!  So I asked what now and he said I'd have to come back to see the oral Surgeon.  As I'm checking out I am told that the oral Surgeon will not be in for a week and I was like don't you think I'm gonna be in a lot of pain and I was told there was a 50/50 chance.  I was just given a script for an antibiotic and told to come back the following week.  OMG I was in so much pain that night and combo of Tylenol and Duexis (prescription ibuprofen I already take daily) was not helping I was in tears and could not sleep and to top it all off the temp crown fell off tooth 31.  I called the dentist in the morning and asked if anything could be done and they said no to just take Tylenol and come next week.  I was miserable for that week of course and it was he'll trying to eat or drink anything.  Got to the oral Surgeon she got the roots out and had to stitch up my gum so I asked to be given something for pain.  She gave me a script for 5 2mg at Ivan which I though was odd but it totally helped.  I managed the pain with those 5 at Ivan, Tylenol and ibuprofen for 3.5 days and when the at Ivan was gone the pain was much worse than the week before.  I went to the dentist office to get the temp crown that fell off put back on and it wouldn't hold because the tooth was not prepped correctly and my gum had started to grown over the tooth because of the extraction site and the crown being off for so long..  I asked for something for pain and the prescribed ketorolac and also told me I needed another surgery to get a crown extention on the tooth the temp crown would not stay on and it would be another week to see the oral Surgeon again.  Well the ketorolac did nothing to help the pain so I was miserable another week.  Had the crown lengthening now and they didn't place the temp,crown on the tooth but I didn't know this until hours later because I was so sedated from the procedure.  I called when I was in complete agony after the sedation wore off and was told my appointment is 8 days away for them to put it on.  I asked for them to give me something for pain and they called in Lodine.  Well the Lodine does not help and it feels like someone took a cheese grater to my gums, then took an ice pick and hammered my teeth it feels like I've been shot in the right side of my face and head.  The right side of my tongue and the right side ofor my lower lip are like number but painful they feel like they are frozen..  I called the dentist and asked for an actual pain killer and they refused.  Is this normal to go through all of this and to be refused pain killers?  I can't eat and it's hard to even drink through a straw, I have to tilt my head to the left side otherwise it causes more pain than I'm already in.  I don't know what to do I have paid them over 2k already on top of what my insurance has paid.  I can't exactly afford to start over with a new dentist.  I'm in so much pain I have a massive hole where the tooth was extracted, a tooth with a missing temp crown and a tooth that has a temp crown that kills if I put pressure on it.  Someone please help and let me know what my options are.\n\nPLEASE IGNORE THE WORD SCHOOL IN THE TITLE.  KNOW IDEA WHY IT'S THERE EXCEPT MY TAB MUST HAVE AUTO ADDED IT."

For the most part I am happy with my dentist but I would like to here other opinions on my dental care plan.\n\nAfter my initial visit and x-rays I was given a dental plan. I was dealing with some extreme pain on the right side of my mouth from severally decayed teeth. Because of the pain I came back three days later and had three teeth removed. The next step in my dental plan is to have a deep cleaning performed. It's broken into two visits my first will be on May 26th. My question mainly comes after the deep cleaning. I have the following steps on my treatment plan.\n\n1. Root Canal of tooth 3.\n2. Surgical Extractions of teeth 18,16,12, and 9(All of these teeth are broken at various stages. Tooth 18 sometimes cause me discomfort but nothing major.)\n3. Filling in teeth 1,2,4,6,13,14,15,17.\n\nThe dentist has the surgical extractions first on my treatment plan, she wants to remove all the dead and painful teeth first.\nMy insurance has a $2000 Annual Maximum, I can't afford dental care after the maximum runs out, because of this I will not be able to finish my treatment plan until next year.\n\nI am wondering what's more important, getting fillings or having the surgical extractions. I would assume the fillings would be more important. If I get the extractions done then I will not be able to get the fillings until 2018. I am worried if I go 6 months without the fillings I might end up needing more root canals.\n\nMy current idea is to get the deep cleaning this year, all of my filling and extraction of tooth 18. I would then get the rest of the bad teeth extracted in 2018 along with the root canal/crown  and maybe a partial denture in 2019. Does this seem like a good plan.\n\nThanks calcium48: that's a lot of work\nleave the fillings until last"

Left my tooth open to drain for a week or two. The swelling was down a lot, just a slight bit to the right of my nose. My next return was to close them up. He closed up the one tooth that was good, as he was in the process of filling the other, I just had severe pain starting beside my nose and spreading down through my check. The dentist had no idea what was happening, his exact words, \"that is impossible, we are not doing anything right now\".

Then I felt my cheek begin to expand, after I got him to stop. I told him my check had been blowing up like a balloon. He said the infection had to have connected in my sinuses, he worked out a large about of infection in my check. I went home, no antibiotics, pain killers or anything.

Hopefully someone here can help me. My situation isn't dire but my pain is at an eight. To me that's just above tolerable but still extremely annoying and sometimes difficult to live with. lol\n\nAnyway...I recently had two teeth removed. No problems there but due to the fact only one zone of my mouth is now \"chewable\" has made me painfully aware of what appears to be a pretty bad cavity behind my right eye-tooth. Took me all this time to realize the pain from my extracted wisdom tooth (had the procedure done six days ago) wasn't what was hurting me the most...it's the stupid cavity which I can very lightly tap and get a rather reverberating echo of ache through the area. Typical cavity symptoms; cold air and liquids make it jolt, sugar makes it ache, etc.\n\nIt's bugging me, severely. I'd like to go have it dealt with tomorrow if I could but is it safe this soon after having an extraction (especially on the same side and general area) to get that sort of work done? Other inquiries lead me to believe I should wait a bit and allow the trauma of my previous work to fully heal before actually going to get the cavity filled but...it hurts. lol, I'd really hate to wait any longer than I have to just to get this taken care of. :/\n\nSo...how long should I wait? It's been six days so far, I'm still sore from the extractions and my jaw is somewhat stiff/tight.\n\nDo I need to just tough it out and wait a bit...? Or is it possible something which feels like a \"cavity\" may be more severe and require more work than expected? I realize dentistry is somewhat of a variable since each person's mouth and general well-being is unique. I'm not in the best health. Can't work, have a hard time consuming enough nutrients to fuel me through a normal day, etc. Could this delay my healing time as well?\n\nI guess this turned out to be more questions than I thought...I just can't help but wonder after the pages and pages of dental information I've read over the last week.\n\nAny and all answers appreciated. =)\n\nThank you~ Xx.dentalgirl: It's fine now."

I raised my hand to let him know it hurt, so then he injected some more and then continued drilling without waiting.  It burned for a while, but eventually the numbness took effect.  The second time I went I reminded him it hurt the previous time, so he injected some extra anesthetic and waited a few minutes before starting. The procedure seemed to go fine this time, until the end when he took off the clamp around my tooth.  It made a loud cracking noise and snapped and I could feel a sharp pain, so much I yelled out and a tear ran down my cheek.

Sensitivity is mild unless I eat anything sour which I rarely do. One dentist told me I could get composite fillings which would protect the teeth from further wear and improve appearance. Another dentist said he wouldn't recommend that and that I should go with veneers or crowns instead. Obviously this is way more expensive and, as a disabled cash paying patient, not realistic. He said if I couldn't do either of those it would be best to do nothing at all. I feel like I'm being given two different stories and don't know which to believe. Opinions?"

    "dialogue": "dentalissues: I recently read (what I will refer to as a theory) that generally speaking, you should use one dental remineralization product in the morning and the other at night because if fluoride is mixed with calcium and phosphate they bind together and you literally wash it down your sink. (I believe the author may be referring to specialty, remineralization products.) I see that there is at least one dental rinse on the market whose list of ingredients include some form of fluoride, calcium and phosphates and is to be used after brushing. It seems to me that either there is an inconsistency here, or the binding/wasting theory is wrong, or I am misunderstanding the binding/wasting theory. Can anyone shed some light on this question for me? Thank you. svor1988: I'm a fan of Dr. Scott Frey's perspective. Read his writings on the pH of mouthwashes and the use of fluoride products. My takeaway is that a fluoride toothpaste is best used in the morning, that way the fluoride is available in the mouth through the day as the teeth are exposed to acidic substances, so that the fluoride will replace any OH- lost from the teeth due to the acid.\n\nHe is very critical of most mouthwashes on the market, and I'm in agreement. He says remineralization happens best at a slightly alkaline pH. Anyways, read his stuff he'll say it better than I can.\n\nThe binding/wasting theory as you write seems like a distraction from the big picture. Yes the ions will interact, and you'll loose most of it in the sink, that is a given... they're not all going to deposit on or fill vacancies in your teeth.\n\nMake sure you understand the dental pellicle as well. dentalissues: svor1988 said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMy takeaway is that a fluoride toothpaste is best used in the morning, that way the fluoride is available in the mouth through the day as the teeth are exposed to acidic substances, so that the fluoride will replace any OH- lost from the teeth due to the acid.

    "dialogue": "saitojohn: I need advice on pain and hot & cold sensitivity on my lower left first molar Tooth 19, a month after white composite filling. This tooth was absolutely painless and symptom-less before the filling, and had had no trauma. I am healthy and not on any medications. First I will upload links to the relevant X-ray images.\n\nImage 1: X-ray of Tooth 19 before filling. The yellow circle marks tooth 19, while the red box indicates the “cavity” that the treating dentist (Dentist #1) saw and tried to fix\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VssVF2c.jpg\n\nImage 2: X-ray of Tooth 19 before filling from different angle (taken by Dentist #1)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YEbhu5p.jpg\n\nImage 3: Actual picture of Tooth 19 after filling (taken by Dentist #2)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LQega48.jpg\n\nImage 4: Actual picture of Tooth 19 after filling, with surface area of filling marked in yellow (taken by Dentist #2)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vrhR2Yq.jpg\n\nImage 5: X-ray of Tooth 19 taken a month after filling, first angle (taken by Dentist #2)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GmKFefv.jpg\n\nImage 6: X-ray of Tooth 19 taken a month after filling, second angle (taken by Dentist #2)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/X8HmUuI.jpg\n\n----------\nTHE STORY\n\nIn early February 2017, I visited the treating dentist (Dentist 1) for an oral exam. He seems competent and highly experienced, with a very busy office with advanced equipment.\n\nDentist 1 observed decay in Tooth 19, as indicated in the red box in x-ray Images 1 and 2. He performed an exploratory excavation using laser (no drill) and then filled it with white composite restoration. One week later, Tooth 19 became sensitive to hot and cold, and also very painful when biting. The sensitivity and pain were concentrated in the area where the filling is, at the corner of the tooth facing the cheek and Tooth 18, as shown in Images 3 and 4. Image 3 shows the actual picture of the tooth, and Image 4 marks the surface contour of the filling in yellow. Pressure on the rest of Tooth 19 yielded zero pain, but pressure applied to the filling surface area was so painful that I had to use my other side of the mouth to chew. Even pressing on the filling area hard with my finger yielded soreness. Swishing hot and cold liquids also caused high sensitivity in the filling area, but no sensitivity on other parts of Tooth 19.\n\n3 weeks later, the pain from chewing lessened to the point where I could chew using the filling area of Tooth 19 with little pain. However, sensitivity to hot and cold liquids remained. I returned to Dentist 1 to have my bite adjusted. He used a colored carbon paper for my teeth to bite and grind on, and then used a drill to revise the bite. For the hot cold sensitivity, he used ozone gas to spray the tooth for about 1 minute, claiming that this would help. 1 week after the followup visit to Dentist 1 (so 1 month after the filling and 3 days before this post), the hot cold sensitivity has not improved. While chewing food using the filling area was still tolerable, during empty mouth clenching, the filling area still felt sore from biting pressure. I went to a different dentist, Dentist 2, to check if there’s anything wrong with the filling. The x-rays taken by Dentist 2, Images 5 and 6, show that the filling is far away from the nerve and not deep. No cavity around the filling could be observed. Dentist 2 again revised the bite using carbon paper and drill without Novocain. She said the filling was well done and there is nothing wrong with the pulp nerve, based on the fact that if there were a problem with the pulp nerve, when she fixed my bite with the drill I would’ve found it unbearable without Novocain. She also prescribed oral dexamethasone (0.75mg, 6 tabs, all taken in one day), claiming that after her bite revision and the dexamethasone, I would feel much better.\n\nDentist 2 also hinted that there may have been no cavity at all in the first place, as the “decay” spanning almost the entire height of Tooth 19 in Image 1 was nowhere to be found in Images 4 and 5, which were x-rays taken by the second dentist. Her reasoning is that, the filling covered only the top half of Image 1’s supposed “decay” vertically rectangular block. If the decay in Image 1 in fact existed, then the bottom half of the “decay,” which the filling did not cover, should still be observable in Images 4 and 5, but no decay can be seen in areas where the filling did not cover. But when I specifically asked her \"so do you think the filling was unnecessary because there had never been any decay?\" she avoided directly responding and said something like \"oh that's not necessarily true as there may have been something there and Dentist 1 opened it up, went in there, removed it, and closed it up.\"\n\n3 days after, which is today, the biting pressure pain and hot cold sensitivity have stayed the same despite Dentist 2’s bite revision. I have not taken the dexamethasone since I’m weary of the systemic effects of an oral corticosteroid. I also don’t want to merely hide the pain symptoms using dexamethasone especially when I am suspicious of something else going on in Tooth 19. The pain alerts me that there's something wrong.\n\nNeedless to say, I regret to have let Dentist 1 perform the filling without seeking a second opinion, but what’s done is done.\n\n----------\nCURRENT SITUATION\n\nMy goal is to resolve this asap through accurate diagnosis and proper treatment while keeping this tooth alive without crown or RCT. The last thing I’d want is for this simple filling to turn into a root canal or crown necessity. Cost is not an issue as I have a generous dental insurance so I'll do whatever it takes to make this tooth healthy again.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice on what could be possibly happening to Tooth 19, given that I am feeling biting pressure pain and hot cold sensitivity despite the filling being far from the nerve and done by an experienced dentist using a supposedly precise laser. During empty mouth clenching, Tooth 19 is the only tooth that feels pressure pain. One thing that did improve is pain while chewing: 1 week after the filling, it was so painful to chew with Tooth 19 (with pain coming from the filling area) that I had to rely on my other side to chew. Now the chewing pain has gone down to the point where I can chew with both sides.\n\nI’ve had my bite checked and revised twice by two different dentists. The tooth is much more sensitive to cold (eg. iced coffee, ice cream) than hot, and after it comes into contact with cold, within 3 seconds the tooth would be unbearably sensitive that I am forced to remove the cold stimulus quickly. This sharp sensitivity would dissipate after 2-3 seconds, but a dull minor ache would linger for longer. There is also an occasional throbbing dull ache in the tooth without stimulus.\n\n----------\nA FEW QUESTIONS\n\n1. Could this be a cracked tooth?\n\nThis is my top concern due to Tooth 19's symptoms and the ramifications of cracked teeth. Nothing in the x-rays indicate a cracked tooth. However, I’ve performed a bite test on tooth 19 with a dental chewie, and there is indeed soreness upon moment of pressure release but it is not a sharp major pain. This soreness disappears within 2 seconds after moment of pressure release. Besides the bite test, what diagnostic tests should I request the dentist to perform to definitively confirm or rule out the possibility of a cracked tooth?\n\n2. Could this be a bonding failure, or a cracked filling?\n\nHow can a dentist differentiate between a cracked tooth vs cracked filling / bonding failure?\n\nShould I have the filling removed and redone assuming the filling is flawed, and see if the tooth would feel better?\n\n3. Do I still have problem with my bite as a result of the filling?\n\nI know my bite was perfect before this filling, as I've had thorough orthodontic work done and wear my retainer every night. I've read that a high bite could also cause my current symptoms. Should I continue to try to have my bite revised?\n\n4. What are the chances of this being simply normal post-op pain and sensitivity after a filling where further intervention is unnecessary and the best course of action is to just wait it out?\n\nI’ve had composite fillings done before and never have I experienced this level of discomfort – all of them were symptomless right afterwards. I suspect something’s wrong with the tooth or the filling as something’s off with the symptoms remaining for so long post-op.\n\n5. Based on the x-ray images, in your opinion, do you think I got ripped off by Dentist 1 because there was no decay in the first place?\n\nI’ve tried to provide as many details as possible, but if you have any questions or need further clarification, please don’t hesitate to ask. You're also welcome to PM me. svor1988: This is a long post here is a short answer, I'll try to read the rest later.\n\nRead my first response here: https://www.dentistry-forums.com/th...-my-cavity-enough-resulting-in-my-pain.22356/ saitojohn: svor1988, thanks for the comment. I've read your response in the other thread. Sounds like I have an incomplete cure, debonding failure or open margin issue?\n\nI'm planning to have the dentist replace and redo the entire composite filling -- would that be a reasonable next step from here? If yes, what sort of precautions or requests should I ask of the dentist to ensure a successful and long-lasting filling replacement? For example, using a specific type of bonding agent and composite material? As for curing technique, should I request the dentist to use incremental cure instead of bulk cure?\n\nMy dental insurance will pay for everything so I seek the best materials and techniques available.\n\nI know my post is long. It's challenging enough for you guys to \"diagnose\" my issue remotely online so I tried to be as descriptive and clear as possible with all the explanations and relevant images.

One week later, Tooth 19 became sensitive to hot and cold, and also very painful when biting.\n\nWas it etched with acid between the laser excavation and filling?\n\nIf it was not etched with acid:\nFrom https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02133162:\n\"The results obtained indicate that the bond strength of laser-etched enamel was significantly lower than that of acid-etched enamel.\"​\nThough that paper is from 1995. I'm not sure what current state of the art is. I did see another recent paper saying no bonding difference was found. Food for thought for you I suppose. You could try asking what model the laser is, determine the wavelength & intensity from that, and do a literature search. Sometimes the reading material put out by manufacturers puts their device in the best light possible while omitting or minimizing important details.\n\nIn a non-related paper I did see in SEM photos significant differences between acid etched and laser etched enamel; the acid etched looked far better in terms of bonding ability.\n\nThe bond would be more important in fillings on the chewing surface.​\nIn the event there is decay forming in a crevice between the composite and enamel (due to the poor/insufficient bond), avoid all sugary and acidic foods/drinks in the meantime, and rinse (with water) after meals. Minimizing food for bacteria means minimizing lactic acid produced, and thus minimizing further decay.​\nI'm not done reading yet. You could also try seeing advice elsewhere, like reddit or telemedicine services- you should be able find more knowledgeable advice than mine. saitojohn: I recall that it was indeed acid etched, since he applied something sour to the tooth before filling it."

I preferred a dental implant, but they said I could better wait a while because of my age. I am a 17 year old boy. The missing tooth I am talking about is located in the upper jaw between the front and the canine tooth on the (from my perspective) left side.\n\nI had the following questions:\n\nMy teeth would be able to change position in a couple of years, what would cause my implant to have a different position compared to my other teeth. But I am wearing a retainer every night to keep my teeth in place. With that retainer, my teeth can't change position, can they?\nIf I would be fully grown, I could place a dental implant. How do I know if I am fully grown?\nWhen I would decide to place a dental implant, could I replace it if it doesn't look good anymore because I placed it too early?\nWhat would happen in the worst case if I decide to place a implant? Can it really do that much harm?\nThe reason I would prefer to place a dental implant already is because I am scared that my Maryland Bridge will break (I am really careful while eating and brushing my teeth because it broke earlier) and according to my orthodontist the bone on a place where the tooth is missing will disappear more and more. If I would place it right now, I could immediately place it. If I wait longer I need a bone graft.\n\nThank you very much for answering my questions! svor1988: > When I would decide to place a dental implant, could I replace it if it doesn't look good anymore because I placed it too early?\n\nUnfortunately they cannot easily remove the dental implant. The crown can be replaced, but not the post. You may note that they screw the post in, but they cannot unscrew it. Counter-intuitively they do not unscrew the implant after the implant had osseointegrated (bone grew to it securely) as that may fracture the jaw at the torque required. What must be done instead is to drill all around the implant to remove it.\n\n> What would happen in the worst case if I decide to place a implant? Can it really do that much harm?\n\nYep. While they may quote a 95% or 98% success rate out 3-5 years from placement, that is still 1 out of 20 or 1 out of 50 people for whom those implants had failed... pretty high odds of failure given that the cost of failure is placed entirely on the patient given the practitioner had made no mistakes. Look up the lifespan of dental implants... 50% fail by the stated lifespan.\n\nAs an analogy, a friend in my high school went missing for a month, then she came back completely blind, walking around with a seeing stick. On vacation she'd taken an over the counter car sickness pill, which unknown to her and her family, it has a 1 in 100000 chance of permanent blindness as a side effect. Knowing those odds, I would tolerate the car-sickness...\n\nMany things can go wrong, such as peri-implantitis (chronic infection), permanent nerve damage (e.g. permanent loss of feeling in face/tongue), or even the implant going up into your sinus cavity... with a sinus perforation/communication. Look up \"dental implant negligence\" or \"dental implant malpractice\" for some horror stories, though you may have to dig to find people's testimonies.\n\nI was pressured into a dental implant at age 18... thinking my parents were paying for it, and the dentist says it's the best thing to do, and it was one of the worst decisions in my life... costing me over 30k in direct damages over the next 8 years in surgeries, CT scans, antibiotics for years, appointments, and work lost due to being sick so much (I was bedridden for 28 days at one point as infection was spreading around my skull). Indirect damages would include things such as me having to postpone my education two semesters due to being sick so much and unable to meet deadlines. Given the choice again I'd just go without a tooth there."

I do not have private health insurance and need to pay for the treatment 100% (Australia). \n\nI found a dentist with a good price, however he recommends a premium, full ceramic crown. The 2 teeth (base for the crown) are currently filled with amalgam. He recommends to remove it and use a white filling. \n\nThe white filling and full ceramic crown are expensive add ons. Is this really recommended? svor1988: It is up to you really. I don't like bridges as they drill down the enamel on the supporting teeth, possibly leading to premature failure on them. Look up the lifespan of dental bridges. Personally I'd either just get the tooth pulled and deal with it, or do a root canal (even with a substantial amount of tooth structure gone, a professional can place an endodontic post, but if the tooth structure loss/decay (aside from the pulp) extends below the gumline then it may be best to extract). Anyways... different dentists may treat this issue differently.\n\nWith whatever service you want, call some more dentists in your area and get quotes from them, their secretary should be able to give you quotes. After they give you a quote ask if they offer a cash discount. Make sure you get quotes on the full service... one lady on here was only quoted for the root canal and not the crown but she was led to believe the $1000+ quote was for everything, she was livid.\n\nIf there are no problems with the amalgam fillings I personally would not get them replaced... look at the lifespan of amalgam fillings as compared to composite fillings and do what you want. The most cost-effective choice would be to only replace the fillings when they fail."

My whole lower raw jaw was swollen and it as you can imagine was painful. I went to the er to have most of it drained and was put on antibiotics. A week later it is pretty much back to normal and I went to my dentist who said it needs an extraction. He showed me the xrays where there is a cavity that looks like a half moon on the side of my lower molar that extends almost to the nerve (on the tooth next to the one with the filling that fell out)\nNow my question is if it really needs to be extracted, or if a root canal would be a better option?"

I'm 28 years old and my jaw has made popping/clicking sounds any time I open it even slightly for as long as I can remember (I remember dentists commenting about it in elementary school). I've been to probably 6 different dentists throughout my life and since I have no pain/discomfort, they never had any concerns. I don't have any wear on my teeth from excessive grinding.\n\nI saw a new dentist today (the practice changed owners). She was not happy with my jaw. She tried making it close in different positions to make the sounds stop, but they didn't. She refused to believe that it's not painful to me. I told her that I do clench my jaw during the day if I'm stressed. She said that means that I am clenching all night as well. (I sleep on my side and I snore. My mouth is rarely closed when sleeping from what I've been told. But I guess I could be wrong).\n\nShe wants me to get a night guard and consider a device during the day. I really don't see the need at this point? She didn't even have time to tell me A) What the condition actually is and B) What the problems would be in the future without treatment.\n\nI usually have the \"if it's not broke, don't fix it\" attitude but I also don't want to create a problem by not doing anything. I just want to know why she was so worried about it when 5 dentists before her (younger and older) weren't concerned. Any ideas? John Roberts: Sorry no one has replied.  You might read up on TMJ.  I think you have jaw popping with that but if it doesn't bother you I don't have any idea what you would do.  I would say to get another opinion but you have already did that.  I thought I might have TMj with all the problems I am having but they haven's said anything about it.  Good luck with what you find out."

If people have had them, how does it affect day to day life as well as your social life, nights out etc.  Also if people have had the clear brackets are they hard to stop staining?

How bad will the afterpain be? How long before i can eat/drink etc? I got on holiday 6 weeks after the procedure.\nThanks all\nSam Mygirl: Hello \nI had all my teeth out and use to be so scared of the dentist. \nI had 6 out and felt fine next day just a bit achey.\nThen awake (can't believe I did it) I had 19 teeth out and dentures straight in. It took 30 minutes. I could have drove home I felt that well after.\nThe worst part was probably the injection and this is one of reasons I was scared of dentist but I had quite a few as kept feeling things and I was fine.\nI wonder if you could use oragel before which will numb you a bit. \nCould make it easier. I also always take painkillers & ibuprofen before app.\n\nI was scared of the pain to come but it want too bad, and I am a softy, I felt bruised and sore from day 2 & sickly from the horrible taste, but can not believe how fast I healed. I had a lazy week  to recover and that was more than enough for me.\nI had to go back after a week due to a few sore spots but the dentist sorted this in 5 minutes and was fine after this.\n\nI lived off mash & beans for 10 days as I'm a fussy eater, I even had this the same day.\nI did ask for antibiotics for after both apps as I had suffered a dry socket in the past and I was scared of that happeneing again as that pain was very bad.\n\nI got my permanant dentures 8mts later and could not have been happier.\nBest choice I have ever made.\nNo more pain and I suffered for 5years and was also paranoid due to ugly teeth. \nBack to happy and confident now.\n\nGood Luck I hope all goes well and you are happy with the result.

I will take your advice and take some stong paracetamol before i go i cant take ibuprofen unfortunately as im allergic but will probably ask the chemist to recommend an alternative i can use. I will also ask the dentist for some antibiotics as i too have had dry socket before and ive read that as a e-cigerette user i would be prone to that anyway.

Been told gotta come back nect Thursday for the wisdom tooth and other molar. After that im still not 100% sure what the plan is, felt like i was pushed out the door frankly. I dont know if the moulds for the dentures will be done next week before they remove the wisdom or if i will have to come back again another week on just for moulds and then have to wait another week or so for the dentures. Im honestly in pieces here, really dont know if im coming or going. Trying ro put on a brave face as i have two autistic teenagers who get distressed if they see me upset. After explaining all i thought i was having done today to them to then have to explain that i now dont really know what is happening has really thrown them as it is. \nAnyway on a happier note, i can say that despite having 4 teeth pulled at once and nothing covering the exposed holes, im not really in any extreme pain. A little soreness but thats fine. Ive been able to eat some soft food and drink pretty much normally and dont seem to have much swelling as yet either. Tomorrows another day."

I was wondering would you do braces to straighten the teeth then replace the lost teeth with implants, or the implants before the braces. Also can yellow teeth be made white again? I mean they're not YELLOW YELLOW, but defintley not white. I'm from the UK if that makes any difference. Thank you all! \n\nEDIT: I found a picture on google and coloured red the teeth I need replacing if that helps\nhttp://imgur.com/a/hq6iC svor1988: From https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3872851/\n\"Although good follow-up data exist for implants, the question of true long-term success and/or survival still needs to be answered. However, a recent study provided 20-year data on implants with a rough, microporous surface in partially edentulous situations, with 72 of 145 original implants remaining for follow-up after the exclusion of deceased patients and those lost to follow-up (Chappuis et al., 2013). Of these implants, 68% had been without technical complications. The success/survival rate was 75.8%/89.5%. Still, these long-term data are scarce. Even after the completion of craniofacial development, implant placement in young adults may therefore be viewed with caution, since restorability options in areas where implants were previously lost have yet to be explored on a higher evidence level.\"\n\n\"[At 3 years after installation] the survival of implants placed by inexperienced practitioners was 73.0% compared with 95.5% by implant specialists (Morris and Ochi, 2000a,b). A comparison of tooth survival rates after endodontic treatment by endodontic specialists vs. general practitioners, in a multi-center study consisting of 350 teeth that met the inclusion criteria, showed a difference of only 98.1% vs. 89.7% (Alley et al., 2004).\"​\nIf you want dental implants, don't go to a normal dentist for dental implants. Read about implant specialists.\n\nImplants do not support the full load that natural teeth do- you should avoid using them to avoid failure. If you're young, don't consider them, they won't last your life unless you are very lucky. 20 years out from now 1-2 of the four implants will likely have failed or suffer complications (e.g. chronic infection or too much bone loss).\n\nConsider consulting with an endodontist or two, at consultations of $25 or so each (in the U.S., in the U.K. I have no idea). They may be able to use their increased skillset to salvage your teeth, where a general practitioner may not be able to.\n\nI think in the UK dental implants are not covered under the public health care, they must be paid for privately. You'd have to get quotes from practitioners, it is up to them how much they'll charge you for dental implants."

    "dialogue": "michael23: My girlfriend recently went to the dentists office and came back saying she will need $10,000 worth of work done. This includes her getting five crowns at $750 a piece, and her four wisdom teeth pulled. The rest is just cleaning and other basic things. Insurance only covers $2,000, and she will go in 3 times over the next couple of years so insurance can help. My problem is with the first appointment. It is $5,000 and requires five crowns. I have read about crowns/ fillings and even asked a freind who is a dental hygienist. Is this dentist probably pushing crowns over fillings to overcharge her?\n\nA little about my girlfriend. She is only 23 and brushes her teeth everyday, but hasnt been to the dentist in 5 years. The teeh are not cracked and do not give her pain (except sometimes when she is eating). She also can be gulible which is why the $10,000 bill didn't phase her and why I am looking into it.She does live in Chicago, which can be pricier, and probably chose a higher end dentist office.\n\nI did have her ask the dentist about the crowns, and before she even finished the sentance over the phone the dentist replied back at her that she absolutely thinks she needs crowns and that if she gets fillings that she cannot promise they will not fall out. From what I have read, crowns are the absolute last resort before root canal and they are rarely used over fillings. My dental hygienist friend also thought that was ridiculous, but could not say forsure without seeing the X-Rays.\n\nI am urging my girlfriend to get a second opinion, but my advice/freinds advice is not enough to convince her. So I am coming here to get others thought on if this is most likely the dentist being ridiculous. I can see a 40 year old who didn't brush having these problems, but a 23 year old who is extremely clean? One or two crowns wouldn't be as suprising, but needing all five for $3,500? Please help, does she abslutely need a second opinion or am I overreacting? Tim Smith: Not sure, but I have heard dental work can be very expensive. I would definitely get a second opinion. JaketheDog33: Her age doesn't necessarily mean that she can't have dental issues. Some people seem to get cavities easier (but I'm not a medical professional, just personal experience with friends). \n\nHowever, I would really recommend a second opinion. That does seem like a lot of crowns. I have small cavities filled almost every time I go in for a check up but I have never had to have a crown. svor1988: Wisdom teeth removal is rarely medically necessary. Your dentist may still pressure you as the procedure gives a nice insurance payment of a couple hundred for each of them (or thereabouts). This practice is pretty pervasive in the industry and you can read online elsewhere about the reasons... I suggest your friend keeps the teeth, they'll be handy to replace other teeth lost decades later in life- the molars naturally drift forward to fill gaps. Any resultant eruption problems they may cite may be countered by wearing an inexpensive mouth-guard nightly. If they cite impact issues it's likely sheer impact which will cause temporary pain during the eruption- look at the xray yourself and make a judgement. If the wisdom tooth is literally horizontal, literally beneath the adjacent tooth such that eruption would erupt the other tooth, or severely deformed those would be good examples of medically necessary reasons for removal. I wish insurance companies would require proof that each extraction is medically necessary for many reasons: as a cost saving measure, to prevent unnecessary antibiotic usage, and unnecessary narcotic exposure (risk of physical/psychological addiction with narcotics).\n\nAbout the other issues, I can't say without looking at an xray. Yes for that much money get second and third opinions/quotes on work. Should be about $25 for each consultation. Make sure she is going to dentists which her insurance prefers. Treat this just like getting quotes from professional auto-mechanics for work- beware of upselling.\n\nIf she isn't getting pain then remineralization, proper brushing, and occasional fluoride product usage could hopefully fix the issues. No one here can really say without visual information.\n\nAlso, crowns don't last for life. The average lifespan of a crown is 10 years. Longer if properly cared for and installed by a skilled honorable practitioner."

I went for a consultation last week. He said that the extraction could be tricky. He said it could not be restored. It could break apart when extracted he said, then he described the process as picking glass out of concrete. He said extracting it whole would be a bonus. The xray I asked his secretary for he did not perform. When I said is there likley any infection under the tooth he said it was irrelevant..Then he gave me a spiel about how good he is at extraction (does 100 a week he said) after initially putting doubt in my mind that his technique was best option.\nMy question is what is my best option.

I have various stomach disorders that make gaining weight insanely hard. I don't have an eating disorder either so don't bring that up. I just have a lot of problems with my stomach so even getting my weight to 112 pounds was a struggle but I got there. \n\nThen I go with the clear choice implant thing, just for the top of my mouth I didn't need it for the bottom. They tell me I need to be on a soft food diet for 90 days. \n\nIt's day 54. I can't do this any more. I'm obsessed with food. That's all I've been doing for an entire week every waking hour is obsessing over food that I can't have because I'm starving. Everything I eat at this point I have no enjoyment over. I am force feeding myself so I won't die and if you think I'm being dramatic I'm 104 pounds at this point. Yes I've lost 8 pounds on this crap diet. I have no energy, I can't concentrate. I'm in a permanent brain fog and overly fatigued. \n\nI take vitamins but that doesn't seem to be helping much. Every last bit of food I eat I have to force down my throat because I find everything so disgusting that I don't want it. Even when I do have an appetite (which is hardly ever) there's no food that I can think of that I want to eat that I also can eat. \n\nIf I've lost 8 pounds in 54 days, in another 46 days I'm going to lose 8 more. This will drop me down to under 100 pounds and at my height that's not a good idea, in fact it's practically dangerous due to my heart condition. \n\nI can't do this any more, this was the biggest mistake of my life. I'd quite frankly rather be in pain than nauseous most of the time and hungry the rest of the time knowing I can't eat anything. I've done every last soft food you can think of that I can also eat. I don't want anything any more other than real food. \n\nDo I really have to do this for 46 more days because if I drop under 100 pounds at my height then it's going to be VERY Dangerous. Yet, everyone's suggestion is like \"Drink more smoothies\". Well it's not easy to do that when you are so sick of them you have to force swallow them. \n\nHow in the world do I do this for 46 more days without losing my sanity and possibly my life if I drop to 95 pounds or whatever? How do people do this crap diet for 90 days and not go completely insane? \n\nThere's only so much soup you can have before the idea of it makes you nauseous. Eating the same 4 varieties of food over and over and over have not only killed my digestive system but my mind as well. I can't fathom living like this for another 46 days.

It also would not come out after being \"jammed\" into place. It had to be pulled on with considerable force to get it out of my teeth and we had to try pulling at different angles. It felt like my teeth were in a straight jacket. When we would pull it loose, it would bounce around my mouth and hit my teeth like you expect something to do when you pull on it will a lot of force and it suddenly gives way.\n\nI was very uncomfortable with this process. After 3 times of this thing getting stuck in my mouth, I stopped the whole thing and would not allow them to put it back in my mouth. The dentist said she would get the lab to make another one with a soft inside. She did not make any new impressions of my teeth.\n\nIs this normal?\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nTim Tim Smith: anybody have any ideas?"

While he was doing the crown he said a piece of the instrument fell in my tooth but it should be fine. Well a month later I've been in extreme pain the last few days. Went to another dentist today as I honestly did not get a good vibe from the dentist that did the crown. They did xrays and the tech that did the xray seemed a bit shocked, as well as another person, at what they saw. I asked if they saw something wrong and they said they think so but they would let the doctor talk to me. Well the doctor confirmed that there was piece of the instrument in my tooth and it was not plugging up/sealing a \"hole\"( and oh by the way he did do a root canal) and this was causing drainage and thus an infection. She did say, without me asking anything, \"in the doctors defense\" it was a wicked angle root canal. I did not ask any questions regarding if the doctor did anything wrong but I did get the gut feeling she was not revealing her true feelings. She said the tooth needs to be extracted and I need an implant. I'm going Monday to see the oral surgeon to get the tooth extracted.\n\nI'm inquiring here because after the doc left the xray tech and another office person seemed to imply the previous doctor was a bit at fault. The one woman said he should have sent me somewhere to have the piece of instrument removed(which I believe she said was zinc...not sure how she would now). It DEFINTELTY seemed by her reactions that what was done was not right.\n\nI'd like to know if anyone can offer advice/input as to whether this doctor was at fault when he did my root canal(which I didn't even know) and because now I'm going to have to pay thousands of dollars and if this was caused by his irresponsibility than I should not have to shell out all this money.  I believe in always doing the right thing and I'm not looking to get reimbursed from him if he did the right thing, I completely ok with that but if he should of done something that could have prevented this that's a different story.\n\nThank you very much."

    "dialogue": "RandomGuy: About two months ago, I had a root canal to treat a tooth that was hurting badly. The dentist put on a temporary crown after the root canal and made an appointment to put on a permanent crown. The temporary crown felt very high, and it made it difficult to bite down. The root canal cured the pain, but I began to get new pain from biting down on the high crown. The pain started in the gums near the tooth in question, but ended up spreading to pretty much that whole half of my mouth.\n\nThe dentist had some difficulties getting the permanent crown from their supplier and had to delay the appointment to put in the permanent crown multiple times. I ended up getting the permanent put in a little more than six weeks after the temporary crown was put in. I told the dentist I was having substantial pain, but they told me that was normal with a temporary crown. They said the pain would go away within two or three days.\n\nIt has now been twelve days since the permanent crown was put in and I am still experiencing pain, even though my bite feels much more natural with the permanent crown. Is there anything I can do to speed the healing? Should I see a different dentist? Thanks in advance for the advice. jameslehman694: You should avoid crunchy, hard or tough food on a recently treated root canal tooth for several days afterward. Staying with softer foods and chewing on the opposite side are very helpful to reduce pain after root canal treatment. Dr. Lakshmy Sanuj: u should avoid eating hard stuffs from that side.and if possible avoid that side for 1-2 week. do a gum massage with finger around the root canal treated tooth. Slowly the pain will reduce.tc."

Anywho, fast forward to August and I was still having pain when chewing as well as severe pain when anything remotely sugary came in contact with my teeth, as well as cold sensitivity. I went back to Aspen and they took xrays then just told me I shouldn't be having pain and if I wanted to, I could schedule an appointment for a root canal consult for $100. They were very short with me and I had the distinct feeling that even if they had messed up my teeth and there was something wrong, they wouldn't have admitted it.\n\nFast forward to now and the chewing sensitivity has gone down some, but I still have immense pain when eating sugary foods and I am suspecting leaky fillings. I am going to get a second opinion from another dentist in my area that owns his own practice. If they are leaky fillings, do you think I'd be able to take the diagnosis back to Aspen and demand my money back?

Best results ever was so pleased and great dentist.\n\n\nI then moved 100 miles from my home town and went to a new dentist and sadly my front tooth broke while eating one day, the dentist suggested I really needed a crown and it would be 550 pound and as I've had it done before privately I was happy to go ahead as i assumed it would be as straight forward as before...\n\nBoy was I wrong !\nThe usual I had to go and see the lab who were making it. Lovely people at the lab and I done my research on them before hand and thought it was brilliant they were award winning.\nHowever when I got my crown prep I had an awful experience with the temporary crown it looked an awful yellow tone with white patches in the middle (see photo attached). I raised these concerns to the dentist and he said he could not colour match it so I left with a yellow front tooth! After thinking about it more I decided it was unacceptable and called for a chat with the manager who then booked me in to have it redone to a more suitable standard.\n\nGot sorted and I left feeling a bit more confident in the practise. 3 weeks later back again for the official crown to be cemented in however it was a bit chunkier than my other crown next to it so I again raised these concerns and he said it was due to the shape of my own tooth as it stuck it more ( it didn't before see photos before I ever walked into this dentist.\n\nSo he cemented it in and sent me on my way. I got a second opinion from my previous dentist who said it was unacceptable especially as it was private and I had spent 550 pounds.\n\nBack on the phone I go and booked an appointment to have a chat with him. He was so rude and kept cutting me off and was for none of it.\n\nI then asked for the manager who was very nice but did not seem too keen to replace it.\nBut in the end she agreed to replace. I was asked to go back to lab again and so I did and when I arrived it turns out this award winning lab never even made my crown as I was led to believe! They only colour matched it.\n\nSo now the are actually making it and today I went to get it cemented in and again it's not right it is whiter and longer than my other crown next to it. So back to the lab again later today he was not happy.\n\nAny advice would be great I feel I've been treated badly and I'm scared this won't get sorted out.\n\nThis has been on going now since October\n\n\nI have attached photos\n1. My teeth before attending this dentist 1 year ago ( in the red headed person)\n\n2. My temporary crown I was sent away with\n\n3.

I also never really took care of my teeth when I was younger, so I have plenty of problems. About 2 years ago, I lost a filling in a molar on the left side. I called a dentist immediately, but they wouldn't see me for two weeks, assuring me it would be fine. When I arrived, they did a cleaning, tried to tell me I had periodontal disease (I was 31 at the time) and wouldn't touch the void where the filling was, which had already started to get bigger. They wanted me to come back in a week or 2 later, so I did...and they said everything had improved, no reason to think I had PD anymore, but still wouldn't touch the filling. Offered to give me a temp filling for about $350, so I refused (and put a temp filling in myself for about $3). They also told me I had to have all 4 wisdom teeth removed before they would do anything at all for the lost filling. After my dental insurance, they were telling me the specialist they work with would cost me about $1k per tooth out of pocket. So fast forward two years, I still have a gaping hole in a molar, and have only been able to chew on the right side of my mouth for a little over a year because if I hit that tooth by accident, I come close to blacking out from the pain. Needless to say, this dentist didn't exactly instill confidence in me about this industry...but I know I really need this taken care of soon before it either gets really bad consistently or leads to other problems that could shorten my life. I guess the biggest fear is judgment about the state of my grill since I know how I think about some of my customers when they neglect things...I guess the real question is, can it be bad enough it's not salvageable?\n\nTIA"

My understanding was if I do intend to go down the implant root at a later date I should get a specialist implant dentist who knows how to preserve the bone. The dentist says if there is not much bone I can always have a bone graft anyway.\n\nThe dentist also says if I don't want to I don't need to have dentures to \"fill\" the gap. (I was told by other dentist that if I don't \"fill the gap\" with dentures my other teeth will \"grow over into the gap\". The dentist said the other teeth will grow over into gap eventually but this will take 10s of years!\n\nSo my plan for now is just to have tooth extracted on NHS and see how things go before I do anything els.

The space between 12 and 14 closed and 13 grew in \"lingually\" (I think that's what it would be called). Basically, it got crowded inward. This obstructed the space for my tongue to properly rest on the upper palate.\nSomehow I have a class 3 underbite. I think I always kept the tip of my tongue downward. I have a feeling my upper palate is underdeveloped due to the lack of tongue pressure.\nI'm 21 now and got my number 13 removed a year ago so now, I don't have a tooth \"in the roof of my mouth\" I'm just now realizing I should keep the tip of my tongue behind my upper teeth. Is it possible for my upper palate to grow with proper tongue pressure assuming that somehow the palatine process was halted and can be resumed?"

    "dialogue": "ToTo: Hi all, this is my first thread in this forum. In 2013, I had a root canal treatment done to the right upper molar. The root canal was overfilled (over instrumented) that the filling substance peirced into the maxillary sinus.\n\nAfter that I began experiencing some strange symptoms and didn't expect that the tooth was the cause. Symptoms like, head pressure, dizziness, loss of concentration and feeling like I'm spaced out, ear pain etc. Those symptoms started to increase in their severity over time. I even developed a psychiatric disorder called depersonalization, a disorder where you feel like you're not inside your body and only an observer of external activities and surrounding. In simple words, it's like a constant brain fog.\n\nTwo years had passed. The symptoms became very severe and I still don't know what is wrong with me. I had the root canal treatment in 2013 and had the same tooth extracted in 2015. When I had the tooth extracted a miracle happened. I got cured instantly of all the symptoms and from depersonalization. Felt like my head and face were very congested and then a pressure got released and I could breath easily with blood pumping sufficiently to my brain.\n\nMy happiness didn't last for long. It was a temporary full recovery for five days and then the symptoms came back more severe than before.\n\nPlease people help. Any idea, advice or suggestion would be really appreciated. I've done every test possible and all of the tests came back normal. I had undergone two sinus surgeries and used sinus meds and migraine meds with no relief what so over. After I got relapsed headaches occur as a new symptom mainly migraine on the same side of the damaged tooth which is the right side. I've been living in hell for three years. And to be honest, in the last year I've been contemplating committing suicide.  I'm a member of dpselfhelp forum, which is a forum for the depersonalization disorder. I made a thread about this issue and no one has an idea of what's wrong or what took place. \n\n   Thanks for reading\n                 And\n   Thanks in advance for those who are trying to help and suggest anything that could be of use. svor1988: It could be coincidence with something else, but you may be onto something.\n\nThe filling material is supposed to be inert. In one case a dentist had obtained a harmful dental filling without knowing how he got it or where it came from: http://www.dentalwatch.org/questionable/sargenti/overview.html Hopefully you still have that extracted tooth if you are interested in testing it. Can you ask the original dentist what filling he used and the distributor/manufacturer?\n\nTitanium is widely cited as inert- but that claim is not true. I've read of people having allergic reactions to titanium, and this paper argues that allergy testing should be mandatory prior to placement: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4248517/\n\nI'm not sure what your sinus surgeries were about. Hopefully you didn't get sold into a sinus bone lift.\n\nTry routine sinus rinses with saline water? Perhaps there are trace contaminants left up there on the sinus floor.\n\nAlso from my understanding, a non-living tooth/implant perforating into the sinus cavity allows sinus flora to reach the mouth, and oral flora to reach the sinus- causing infection in the bone between (researchers discovered this via culturing samples from above/below, sorry I don't have paper link handy). Not good at all if you have a nasty pathogen. In my opinion such a circumstance should never be allowed and that perforating object be removed.\n\nYes, substances can cause unwanted suicidal thoughts. I experienced that as a vulnerable child thanks to GSK pushing ineffective Wellbutrin on minors and a professional doctor that wanted to be rewarded with a cruise... So it is plausible to me that this filling could have caused your experiences.\n\nCurious still about your experience when the tooth was removed. Perhaps the numbing agent had something to do with your temporary relief? svor1988: Another possibility is the antibiotic treatment for the extraction. Gut flora can have a large effect on mood. I see a claim that ~90% of the body's serotonin is produced in the GI tract. Were you treated with oral antibiotics before the onset, and during the lack of symptoms?\n\nLooking around online I do see claims that low serotonin can result in depersonalization.\n\nHealthy gut flora can be made again by... a fecal transplant. Do some research about that. Might take a few tries. If you're not rich then just go find somebody you trust (and is usually happy mood-wise) and ... explain things. Read a case where a mother did it for her son using a blender. In her case I think the doctors did it once while telling them they may have to do it a few times if it doesn't work the first time, but they didn't want to pay for it again so they just did it themselves till her son got better.\n\nReading elsewhere online they do have oral capsules (with poop in them) vs a suppository. I'm really skeptical of the oral capsules surviving the stomache acid though. My personal theory is that the appropriate/healthy intestinal flora is first obtained via the umbilical cord from the mother, and not from the baby's diet, putting things in their mouth and whatever.\n\nAnyways. I hate non-life saving oral antibiotic usage for reasons like this. Lots of unforeseen long-term side effects. e.g. All these long term costs to the patient and decreased life satisfaction just for a few hundred bucks to the dentist for unnecessary wisdom tooth removal. Yes I'm disgruntled about things. So... good luck in your research. ToTo: Here's my situation. What I've been dealing with for three years and how I got fully cured temporarily. \n\nhttp://www.dpselfhelp.com/forum/index.php?/topic/51944-100-full-recovery-then-a-powerful-relapse/\n\nDo you think that I'd be a good candidate for a Caldwell luc procedure?!"

    "dialogue": "Concerned Citizen: I have a concern that a disabled adult may be suffering dental neglect.  The situation is as follows:\n\nOn January 22, of the previous year, the dental treatment notes indicate that the disabled adult was “under treatment [to] determine if full-mouth extraction needed, or restore w/ RCT, SSC and partials as needed”.\n\nThe disabled adult had 13 teeth extracted between March and October of the previous year.\n\nOn January 10, the disabled adult had a dental appointment, but it was just a cleaning. His dental records  indicates: “informed caretaker that patient needs tx in or ASAP to prevent further deterioration of dentition.” Dentition is the arrangement of natural or artificial teeth in the mouth.  The notes also indicate “Schedule OR tx. Call Mother to discuss”.\n\nOn October 6, the disabled adult went to the dental clinic for the last time. He had a routine cleaning, after having 13 teeth extracted during 4 previous appointments. His dental notes indicate that he still had 15 teeth. The dental notes also indicate “caries [tooth decay] present on almost every tooth”. The very last entry in the dental notes indicate: “NV: OR tx” - meaning “Next visit: operating room treatment”.  But it appears that he's never seen the operating room at the dental clinic.\n\nUnder Florida Statutes § 825.102, (3)(a) “Neglect of an elderly person or disabled adult” means:\n\n\n\n\n\n“A caregiver’s failure or omission to provide an elderly person or disabled adult with the care, supervision, and services necessary to maintain the elderly person’s or disabled adult’s physical and mental health, including, but not limited to, food, nutrition, clothing, shelter, supervision, medicine, and medical services that a prudent person would consider essential for the well-being of the elderly person or disabled adult”; or\n\n“A caregiver’s failure to make a reasonable effort to protect an elderly person or disabled adult from abuse, neglect, or exploitation by another person”.\n\nSo my question is, does it appear that this disabled adult is suffering dental neglect?

Its inflammated, sometimes its pulsing. Now I know that bacteria and the decay can get into the bone and if should that happen I will better get the tooth plucked out.

I know every tooth is connected with some part of the body and is very important.\n\nPlease help me get the right decision. Is it safe to keep it a few more months?

They cannot see anything the matter.\n\nTrigeminal Neuralgia was mentioned as a possibility, but I dont think i get the severe facial pains associated with it (and hence the specialist wanting to check my brain). I suspect maxillary sinusitis. Caused by a tooth root perforating the maxillary floor. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxillary_sinus#Maxillary_sinusitis\nThe tooth may be dead and be harboring infection- is there cold/hot sensitivity on it? Had your dentist done these tests? Aside from that, oral flora may travel along this perforation into your sinus, and sinus flora may travel along the perforation into your mouth. Your body's defense mechanisms are overwhelmed.\n\n\n\nrichardvilla said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe gum surrounding the wisdom tooth seems swollen and has been for a year or so, but the dentist is ignoring this.

Yes I did. I was bedridden for a month, and would have died without antibiotics. The infection spread laterally and vertically, invading my entire palate, and causing pressure/inflammation on the above eye to the point it was almost unusable.\n\nTreat the maxillary sinus 1-2x daily with a saline rinse, and as needed for pain. This was something my ENT speciallist never told me till very late... it was always antibiotics he prescribed. Sometimes the antibiotics did not help. The saline rinse was far better, and made a world of difference. Familiarize yourself with the maxillary sinus anatomy.\n\nI see two approaches/outcomes given my hypothesis is correct: 1) Your treatment + body may fight off the infection long enough for the sinus floor to lift on it's own, sealing the perforation, or 2) The perforating tooth is extracted, and the perforation is closed that way. The approach depends on if that tooth is dead or not. If it is dead, I'd suggest extraction instead of a root canal, as in my case the root canal did not help any. For 8+ months after the root canal I still endured the symptoms until somehow I knew it had to be extracted, very soon after extraction my symptoms went away, my sinus floor lifted, and I got better!\n\nMy hypothesis does not explain the blood in your mouth, that is not something I experienced. Is it just a little, as if from your gums after you've brushed your teeth?\n\nI lost a great deal of work due to this condition. Lost a lot of soft tissue on my hard palate due to the chronic infections, such that I must permanently hold my tongue on the roof of my mouth or experience sharp and tear inducing pain. Somehow my saliva production was severely decreased, such that I have dry mouth now."

    "title": "incomplete cleaning?",
    "dialogue": "asquirrel: Hi folks,\n\nSorry for the long narrative but I want you folks to get the whole story to understand where I'm coming from.  I went to a private dental practice yesterday (10/16) for what was supposed to be dental scaling.  They told me that the hygienist and dentist would look at me and determine whether or not scaling was needed\nPrior to going to this private dental practice I had been going to a student dental hygiene clinic for a few years.  You know the teaching schools like Tufts University School of Dental Medicine in Boston, MA, where they learn how to be dentists and dental hygienists.\n\nEvery year I went there, they would be very thorough.  They would check my pocket depths, then scale and clean my teeth.  It would take a few appointment to finish but the work was overall, excellent.  I'd have no stains or anything, and my gums would feel great.  The only problem was the commute to get to the school to get the work done and the time to finish the work.  The price was great too, since I didn't have dental insurance.\n\nSo I end up getting dental insurance I go to this private practice with my wife. She gets one hygienist and I get another.  We both go in for cleanings at the same time. The one I get doesn't probe my gums for pocket depth.  The hygienist takes  x-rays and blazes through my teeth.  The dentist comes in.  She immediately starts talking about getting a crown on my cracked molar.  She just agrees with the hygienist that I didn't need scaling.  I don't even see the dentist look at the x-rays that were taken that day, nor does she look at the x-rays which were taken two years ago at the dental clinic.\n\nShe sends me out front where I get the sales pitch about coming in to get that crown put on.  Now mind you, I had to have the molar on the opposite side of my mouth extracted by an oral surgeon, after another dentist said I needed a dental crown and the tooth got infected after he did the work.  It was either get it extracted or get a root canal (after the infection was gone).  So needless to say I wanted to think about it before I spent another $600 out of pocket after the insurance paid its' portion, ans possibly lose another molar from a procedure that goes south.\n\nSo after the cleaning I'm feeling around the inside of my mouth and it's all rough at the base on the bottom front and sides.  Like the hygienist didn't even scale the teeth above the gum line.  She used a manual scraper instead of an ultrasonic, since I told her I had sensitivity to the ultrasonic in my bottom lower front teeth.  My hygienist and the dentist are in the back working on the next patient and the office manager / receptionist is setting up my next appointment.  I ask the office manager why they didn't probe my gum depth.  She says, \"oh next time they will do it.\"  Another hygenist comes out to the front (nice young lady who did an excellent job on my wife's teeth. She says that maybe it's the exposed roots and that's causing the roughness.  I set up another six month appointment and head home with my wife.\n\nI get home and for the first time after the cleaning I look at my teeth.  They are all yellow and stained.  There's brown, which looks like tartar that goes stained.  Also, it looked like she didn't get in between any of the teeth to scale out the plaque (I could see dark black stains in there)  It looks like all she polished were the front teeth and that's it.  The inside of my mouth (especially the bottom) is all rough, like the tartar is still there.\n\nSo I call them up and voice my concerns to the office manager.  Instead of saying, \"no problem.  Come on in and we'll take a look\" she say, \"well the dentist looked at your teeth and it's all fine.\"  I tell her it isn't what can she do.  She puts me on hold and then says, \"come in and we'll do an assessment on you.\" I have an \"assessment\" set up for next week.\n\nLat night, I'm digging at with my fingernails in between my molars because I'm getting the same pain I get when the teeth have not been cleaned.  Like the gums are inflamed by the bacteria.\n\nSo, my questions -\n\nI've uploaded some pictures that I took today for you on my google drive.  At first I thought I was overreacting, but I know whenever I went to the clinic I didn't have hardly any stains leftover and my gums were fine.  I can clearly see all kinds of stains and black stuff in between the teeth.  The camera shots aren't that great but it's the best I could do by myself.  But they do show more or less what I'm talking about.  I've also looked online and even Delta Dental says they are supposed to take care of those stains from cleaning. \nMy theory is either these were stains that were not buffed out from the cleaning, or the stains is actually the tartar that was missed by the hygienist and the tartar is stained from food or drink.\n\nAgain, sorry for the long narrative but I'm angry that the treatment I received is so far below the quality I got at the clinic.  Plus, I feel I probably needed the scaling but they didn't have enough time to do it so just did a cleaning. \n\nIf you could please take a look at the photos of my gaping maw and weigh in I'd appreciate it. \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3M4i-BvVA2KVmFCNnhfZTNTdWc"

    "title": "Question about poorly performed filling causing need for root canal",
    "dialogue": "stabby: Hello! First time post, and need a bit of guidance before I pursue this any further.\n\nFirst, a bit of history.\n\nMy wife used to go to a dentistry practice in our home town. Her doc retired and was replaced by a new dentist. Some time last year, this new dentist had performed some dental work on my wife, which included some fillings. A few days later, she experienced some pain in the tooth where there the filling was done, and upon informing the dentist he told her that the sensitivity is normal and to see how it feels in the next few days. She did say the pain eventually went away.\n\nFast forward a couple of months, she ended up going to a completely different dentist because she didn't have a good feeling about him, and I'm finding that the feeling was justified. Today, she noticed a hard bump on the outer gum right above one of the teeth that received the filling. The new dentist told my wife that whoever did the filling did a really poor job - the filling will filled incorrectly, and he had apparently gone too deep, taking too much tooth. As a result, the nerve died in the and she now has to get a root canal.\n\nMy question is, does any liability fall on the dentist that performed the original filling? It appears his incompetency is why shes not in the boats shes in now Our new dentist stated that she is certain the dead nerve was caused by the poor filling work. A root canal isn't cheap, especially since she'll have to get a crown as well. \n\nI understand any info anyone here is able to provide comes without warranty and by no means is official legal advise, but I just wanted to see if there was any possibility of patient protections before I really dig into tackling this. We live in Pennsylvania, if that is helpful. svor1988: Call your insurance customer service. They may be able to help or give advice."

    "dialogue": "Sean Kelly: Hi,\nI just got a filling done on one of my teeth, when I go to floss it hurts on either side of the tooth (feels like there is an unfilled cavity in-between the tooth that got filled and the next tooth over). It also hurts to chew on anything that isn't especially soft (anything harder then bread) The dentist advised that there is no cavity between the teeth, and has adjusted my bite a couple times. It has been two weeks since the filling was done. What could be causing the issue? AF05: what type of dental filling? where is the location of the tooth? and the size of the / cavity filling? Does the floss get stuck while flossing ? do you grind or clench your teeth during the day or night?\n\nSean-  assuming that your dentist is stating the truth about the filling, then it could be different reasons.  One could be the size/ height of the filling ( even though the dentist adjusted it)  If the filling material is white composite material, then possible saliva contamination occurred during the process.  Or Composite filling is not cured/ set completely in the tooth.  \n\nListen-  talk more to your dentist and explain the situation.  Maybe they need to redo the filling or for more side or top adjustments on the filling.  Keep me posted.  Regards, AF05 Sean Kelly: the paperwork says the filling is a white bond or something along the lines of that? The location is 3 back from the k9 on my lower right side. The filling takes up most if not all of the top of the tooth. Floss does get stuck when trying to pull it out. I have never grinded or habitually clenched my teeth.\n\nIf it is not cured or set properly, does this eventually go away? He made an adjustment a few days ago, I will give it a couple weeks and see if it disappears, if not I will make another appt. AF05: Okay.  I hope things will be awesome for that tooth soon.  Bty, Do not wait too long if the discomfort continues.  AF05 Zuri Barniv: It is very common to have sensitivity after a white filling and it can last for weeks, months, years or forever. In 99% of cases though, it comes down to the dentist's technique. Proper technique can prevent the VAST majority of sensitivity. In cases where it happens, replacing the filling using proper technique solves the problem. \n\nWhite fillings are easy to do, but very hard to do well. Sean Kelly: I just had the dentist replace the filling and it hurts less now but still not usable without pain, flossing is not a problem anymore. Should I be trying another dentist to see if they can fix the filling?"

Are they actually really good, like everyone says? Neha Garg: Yes, dental implants last forever. and if you're considering dental implants then I would like to tell you that dental implants is not painful if it is performed by experienced dentists with local anaesthesia to completely numb your mouth. You can read more about dental implants by visiting our website. Zuri Barniv: No, Neha Garg is absolutely incorrect, please ignore her post. No dentist can and they should not promise you an implant lasts \"forever\" (or for this purpose, your lifetime). Nothing is forever, not even your own god-given natural teeth. Implants can be lost to gum disease, fractures, infections, etc. Implants are, however, very long-lasting and they hold up a long time IF placed properly, IF they are well-maintained and monitored and IF the final crown on them is done correctly. A lot can and does go wrong, so an experienced team is extremely important. There can be problems with doing complicated higher-risk procedures in other countries. Please do some research on that or read my blog post on this subject. Becky: Zuri Barniv said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tNo, Neha Garg is absolutely incorrect, please ignore her post.

THANKS! Zuri Barniv: In my experience, there is no dental insurance you can get privately that makes any financial sense if you plan to use it at a good quality dental office. You are better off paying cash and asking for a cash discount or something equivalent. The insurance companies make it really complicated to understand and make it look like everything will be covered....and it is, but only if you go to specific dentists on their list. Otherwise, they pay close to nothing and certainly less than your premium over a year. Also, I would NOT recommend dentists on their \"list\", because in many cases, those practices have lots of \"problems\" that we can discuss as a different topic."

My front middle tooth was slightly crooked and i wanted to fix that issue\n2. I have an overbite that I wanted to fix\n\n\nMy treatment started off with about 35 trays and i should have been done after that, but after I completed those set of trays I was given 2 more boxes of trays of about 17 trays, and now I'm down to my third box of trays. I have my last tray of my third box left, and still no fix in my overbite. \n\nAlthough issue number one has been slightly resolved I still think there is need for improvement, and well issue number 2 has never even been addressed. I spoke to my dentist a few months back letting her know my concern of the overbite and how it has not been fixed and all she said was that they will look into it. I recently went to another Orthodontist office and was told that 2+ years was a very long time for this type of treatment and they still saw issues with my teeth. They asked me if I had been given elastics/rubber bands to fix my issue but that has not been the case.  \n\nI am due for an appointment to get a fourth box it seems since my procedure is still not done in my opinion. I have paid the whole amount of the procedure already and at this point I am a bit frustrated that I have paid all that money and have not been properly treated. I have raised my issue of the overbite twice and have not been acknowledged. I fear that going for a fourth box of aligners will just be a waste of time and my issue won't be fixed at the end of it all.\n\nAny advice will be greatly appreciated.. \n\nThank you,\nJesenia"

I'm now 26 years old and i have never had single problem involving my teeth. I visit my dentist about once every 3 months, and he keeps telling me i have some of the most\nstrong set of teeth he has ever seen (no lie, i've even asked him once if he just tells that to people who have good teeth to make them feel pleased, or if it is actually true. and he told me he was telling the truth). \n\ni've even gone to some special check involving a oral hygienist checking my gums, some crazy weird CAT scan and a few dentists because my mother wanted proof my teeth were still ok, because she couldn't believe they still were after all these years. Not a single thing came up.\n\nMy teeth are also not yellow at all (although they aren't clear white like you see in the commercials ofcourse) and i've never had any family member, girlfriend, friend, or someone that dislikes me tell me my breath smelled bad. \n\nnow what do you make of this guys? i'm almost thinking brushing teeth could be a complete scam made up by the dental industry, or do i have some super-mouth? \n\nthanks for reading Paulette: Miraculous.

What do you drink and eat a lot of? honestly, nothing special. i mainly drink water and sometimes fresh orange juice.\nusually i eat just normal sandwiches (cheese, lettuce, tomatoes etc) through the day.\nfor dinner i usually eat pasta, some kind of potato dish or asian dishes like rice or noodles.\ni also order a pizza from time to time (i'm a vegetetarian by the way)\n\nall that said i dont really focus on having a exceptionally healthy diet, i dont drink any soda or any sweets though\n(because i dont like them enough to go through the trouble of buying them ) so that may make a difference for my\nteeth,\n\ni'd say the one thing that i eat most of is probably cheese svor1988: Saliva is antibacterial. Never drink soda and stay away from sweets. If you end up with dry mouth from some pharmasuitical then that would be bad.\n\nThe sodium fluoride in toothpaste changes the chemistry of the tooth surface, making it much more resiliant to soda and things. Fluoride doesn't chemically react with very much at all, so adding it to your teeth does the same. Soda would be very corrosive to normal teeth (like yours).\n\n[link removed by admin]\n\nStill, rinsing with sodium fluoride (never ingest! It is toxic to organs) once a year or so should make your teeth last longer. samadhi: I used to only brush my teeth once every morning and I never flossed for most of my life,I have alway's drank lots of black tea and some green tea and I never had any teeth problems!

It did so they extracted my wisdom tooth (this has healed perfectly now).\n\nThe good news is this has removed about 85% of the pain. However there is still some throbbing occasionally when drinking chilled water and encountering cold air. Also there’s slight pain when chewing. The pain comes and goes. Sometimes I’m fine sometimes not.\n\nI saw another dentist twice and first they gave me some antibiotics (amoxicillin). These didn’t work. This dentist has now referred me to a hospital as he said there is nothing else he can do. Normally waiting time is 25 weeks to see a specialist (NHS) at this hospital.\n\nThroughout the whole time I have been taking ibuprofen and co-codomol which have done nothing to relief the pain. On every dental appointment they have been taking x-rays and each dentist has said the pain doesn’t match the x-ray (I shouldn’t be in pain according to them).\n\nI have been researching irreversible pulpitis and this seems to fit with the symptoms I am currently having.\nThe pain is bearable and only lasts for a few minutes once the cold stimulus has been removed. It is uncomfortable still however. Would anyone agree that this could be the case? Is there anything I can do to speed up the progress?\n\nKind Regards\nPhil"

    "dialogue": "jgetner: 2 days ago i had a lower molar extracted after it started hurting and the only option i could afford to have done was an extraction.  So they went ahead and extracted it.  I informed the dentist before they extracted it im very sensitive to tooth pain its the same for my mother and this is my 3rd extraction and i know what they feel like and i know how much they hurt during the healing process.   So they extracted and then sent me on my way with nothing but the advise to take ibuprofen and tylenol i said ok and i immediately started taking ibuprofen without any tylenol as it makes my stomach very upset and if i take enough i will vomit. I learned that the hard way many times with other things instances and have had that issue for as long as i can remember.  So i started to take the ibuprofen as suggested expecting to have some relief well when no relief came i up'ed my dose to 1200mg which seemed to work for the first day.  On day 2 the pain was very bad and the 1200mg of ibuprofen i was taking every 6 hours was just not giving me any relief anymore and im in very bad pain from this extraction. It came to the point i felt like it was to much and called the dentist and explained i have been taking 1200mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours and im getting no relief and its really starting to affect every part of my life from sleeping to everyday tasks.  They scheduled me an appointment to come in immediately and i went in and they said everything looked ok and i was healing quickly.  I informed them that im in incredible pain and i dont know what to do anymore for relief as i have followed there instructions and its just simply not working.  So they put a clove ball thing over the extraction site and said it should bring down the swelling and sent me on my with instructions to keep taking the ibuprofen at the dose of 800mg every 6 hours.   I said ok and went on my way trusting this would help.  Well its been 10 hours since i seen the dentist and im getting zero relief as suggested i would.  And now im very pissed off i already had a fear of going to the dentist and now im down right pissed off im in alot of pain and out of options for any relief that i know of.  I regret ever getting this molar extracted and really am considering not going to the fucking dentist anymore because everytime i do i seem to come out worse than when i went in.  Im very disappointed as they was suppose to help me and now im sitting here in worse pain and nothing seems to help.  I have taken 1200mg of ibuprofen and have the outside of extraction site and nothing is working and i dont trust my dentist to help me anymore as they didnt even seem to care and honestly acted like they knew my pain better than me.  Im not looking for drugs im looking to not be in pain as i would rather re-dislocate my shoulder than be dealing with this crap and at least that i know the doctors take care of me and it gets better and is managed responsibly and the doctors actually listen to me.  Im no drug addict or anything like that but really ibuprofen is not doing the job for me and i have explained it the best i could and the fucking dentist seemed to careless so im back to the idea fucking going to the dentist"

I also noticed that the upper half of my gums are bright red and the lower half the usual colour. I m on waiting list (1 year) before I can see my dentist. I need so advice so I can decide to go private if it's an emergency. See pictures attached. Kelotin: Please anyone? Plaza Dental Group: There are several things that can cause white spots on the gum, depending on where it is located. Given your age, it is unlikely to be cancer, but if it is raised and growing, then be sure to have it looked at by a MD. Also make sure it isn't just an underlying tooth! Sometimes the gums can be thin and the tooth can be seen underneath it!  Thrush can also appear white, but it doesn't turn red. Visit your dentist who can help you by making an accurate diagnosis of your specific condition. Kelotin: Thank you very much. I went through a heavy course of antibiotics before hand which caused thrush. My GP and nurse both advised it was thrush. As for the red part of the gum, they said I should be brushing with more regularity."

    "title": "Tooth Sensitivity & Jaw Pain pre/post filling",
    "dialogue": "Matty: During a recent dental cleaning, two cavities were discovered, one on top and bottom left side. Since I had been experiencing some jaw pain and sensitivity, this was not surprising and the cavities were filled this past Saturday. No pain during procedure or the day of; however the next day, I started feeling vague pain and mild sensitivity. I waited a few days but since the pain worsened, I returned to the dentist yesterday. He checked the bite, probed, and took x-rays and did not see anything concerning. He suggested warm compresses and ibuprofen. The pain continues and actually the tooth sensitivity has worsened considerably over the last day or so. Ibuprofen does help a bit but the fact that nothing is getting better is my main concern. I should add that another concern (and one that may be a factor here) is that I grind my teeth. During the cleaning, I was instructed to purchase a mouth guard at a sporting goods store to get an idea of the degree to which I grind. I have not done this yet, mainly because I'm concerned with my current issue whatever it may be. Actually, I should add: The pain alternates between pain from the tooth (particularly when liquids touch) to a dull lower jaw pain to odd instances of pain in the cheek and head (perhaps tension headaches). It is not always present but more there than not\nThanks for reading. Any suggestions, experience, ideas?\nMatt svor1988: Look into the composite curing process. If the composite is unevenly cured, flux will cause pain in the tooth. The best provider I've had ran their UV light gun (cures the composite) through two cycles on each composite. The worst ran it for less than one cycle, and the composite fell out that night. If you look at manufacturer differences between the UV light guns, you can see certain models penetrate UV light deeper than others. Skill of the practicioner is a variable here too. Of course, the source of your pain may be something other than flux in the composite. Take a look at it and make sure the composite had not fallen out.\n\nAlso, teeth grinding is a common medication side effect (taking any stimulants or antidepressants?). I suggest you treat your neurological deviancy/symptoms (as labeled by a psychiatrist, I personally see most \"deviency\" as normal human phenomena and dislike their labeling) differently or otherwise cease taking that medication as the sum lifelong wear to your teeth/jaw (can cause TMJ) is likely worse both fiscally and health-wise than the momentary benefit that medication brings you. That is my opinion and warning."

I haven't been brushing my teeth for two years I know really horrible I'm irresponsible and I know I screwed up but right now I don't want to focus on that. \n\nLast time I went to the dentist I can't remember how long ago probably half a year ago. My dentist told me I had no cavities but I had plaque and tartar was building up. She used a hook shaped tool and scraped a lot off and went on with what I assume to be a pretty standard cleaning. I think she also mentioned I had gingivitis about a year ago. I never understood really how serious these things could be and my dentist was so relaxed about it I never really felt worried. She never told my parents that I needed to do anything about my gingivitis she just told me to brush my teeth. \n\nSo now I noticed a very tiny brownish dot on one of my molars. I feel a very light throb  on it that I never even noticed it untill now. the dot is smaller then the tip of a toothpick for reference. \n\nShould I be worried about this?\n\nI also noticed that my gums bleed although as far as I remember they have always bled at every dentist appt. so I never thought much of it\n\nBeing paranoid I looked at my teeth and at the back of the bottom row of my teeth I noticed a thin white line at the place where the gums meet my teeth. I read that this is tartar is this true? I tried to scrape it off but all I did was nick my gums with my finger nail and make it bleed\n\nI also feel like my gums receded at bit, maybe. \n\nSo I'm not sure I don't know I thing about teeth. Right now I'm thinking I'm gonna need my teeth throughly cleaned and have the tarter removed and my cavity looked at and dealt with Im hopping that it's not a serious cavity and just beginning. But after this I'm definitely going to take way better care of my teeth. My teeth seem to be pretty normal looking though I don't have any obvious cavities and the tartar is so little I barely even noticed it, not like in some pictures I've seen where the tarter is a few mm wide and sometimes looks like it covers half of the tooth. I read about a pretty intense looking cleaning where they clean the tartar from under the gums. Is it possible that my cavity is really bad in the tooth and I just can't see it and do you think I need an expensive cleaning to get rid of the tartar?\n\nSorry if this is pretty long I know next to nothing about teeth hopefully someone who knows more can help"

Apparently, my insurance fully paid only $80, which I understand because they cover only what would have cost for amalgam. What I don't understand is why did my dentist not tell me beforehand that it would cost so much? Why did he not get a preapproval by the insurance like he did for my deep cleaning, which after all I did not get? Had I known the cost, I would not have this treatment done because my tooth was not bothering me! All he told me was because I had a gold, it would be better to replace with porcelain (btw there was some crack). I feel like I am ripped off! Is there anything I can do for this situation? Thank you.\n\nSmartbrain svor1988: Sorry I don't know. Conventional advice I see is the only thing you can do is fight billing errors (e.g. wrong codes or services). However the undisclosed fees stick if you'd already signed a contract agreeing to them AFAIK).\n\nIn the future never sign a contract saying you're responsible to pay undisclosed medical expenses. Look over any contracts you've signed with this office. Require exact quotes at time of service. Industry practice is to obfuscate things, like saying they don't know or it's too hard for them to do the math, tell them to do it or you do not agree to any service and will leave. Require up front the costs and a bill saying zero further patient liability. If they don't accept these terms, do not accept their service. Read carefuly everything they ask you to sign, and never sign such open ended contracts. If they (or a third party) send future undisclosed fees regarding this service you can ignore them, since you've already paid for the services rendered in full.\n\nThere are some consumer protections against such undisclosed fee practices under certain conditions in certain states (in NY and Florida only AFAIK).\n\nI'm sorry, this is from my understanding the way it is at this time in the U.S. Perhaps in the future through case law or legislation it will be made illegal.\n\nP.s. that gold crown is yours. I hope you didn't let him have it and instead took it to a gold shop to sell. At $1400/oz gold that would've gone a decent way towards your current issue."

    "dialogue": "madhur gupta: I have been facing TMJ like pain in my left and right sides of face, along with an invisible force at night, which pushes my upper gum and teeth sideways (sometimes rightwards and sometimes leftwards) especially when I take a deep breath or when I bring my upper and lower teeth together so that they touch each other, while I lie down on my back. The pain's nature is that it occurs usually in the right ear, and goes down the edge of my right jawline. It sometimes happens in the right ear too. It also gets worse when I work on the computer or mobile phone for long hours and my cervical region becomes stiff. Sometimes, my hearing ability also goes down for a few minutes in one of the ears before recovering back\nThe pain and pressure become better when I take strong muscle relaxants,\nA doctor gave me a night-guard to avoid bruxism, but it tended to make my problem worse or didn't benefit me at best. The MRI and CBCT scans of the TMJ area are normal.\nAll this has been happening for over 3 months now.\nPlease tell me what you people think is the root cause of this problem and to which specialist doctor should I show this.\nThanks. AF05: Dear Madhur gupta-\n\nYou can see a dentist for a second opinion, a TMJ specialist, and a Chiropractor.   One, you should not be taking muscle relaxants as a solution as its treating partial symptoms and not the cause.    Listen, having a night guard is great, but it needs to be looked at and adjusted as you might be different variations while biting. Furthermore, ask your office to make you a lower soft guard (the thickness of whitening trays) to wear 24 hours (except when eating and brushing), and see if the symptoms would decrease.\n\n\nMy first impression was it's muscle related tension coming from grinding/ clenching on two specific muscle called Massetter and Lateral pterygoid muscles, but here are some questions for you:\nIs your LR wisdom tooth present?\ndo you chew on ice often? \ndo you chew gum often?\nAre you suffering from gum disease?\nDid the dentist rule out any cracked tooth syndrom or/ and root canal problems on any of the LR teeth?\n  Have you had any fillings or crowns done recently in the past year that have created discrepancy in the bite? \n\nLet me know if you have other questions.  Cheers.  AF05 madhur gupta: Dear Sir,\nThanks for your help.\nI am seeing an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for it. My LR (Lower Right) wisdom tooth has been extracted, the teeth adjacent to it was given a root-canal and crown was put on it, and root canal and crown was done for another LR tooth which is 4th in number from the removed wisdom tooth. The surgeon has found problem with my bite and has sent me for a mouth guard to be made to another doctor.\nThe problem started 3 months back when I was infected by Oral herpes and tongue ulcers appeared on my tongue. I took anti-viral (Valacyclovir) and steroid (Prednisone dispersible, to prevent facial palsy as there was a slight twitching in my face and the doctor gave me the steroid as a precaution) for it. I, however kept on taking these medicines for a prolonged 1 month, which is longer than the usual 15 days, and although pain wasn't present then in my jaw, I could feel the \"invisible pressure\" on my upper jaw while lying down. This pressure went away in between for some weeks and has now returned. Is it possible that such strong medicines damaged my TM Joint and/or muscles, because I felt that they were quite harsh on my system and I even lost some hair during that while.\nAlso, for the initial 2 months, the problem was only in the right chewing muscle and not in the ear, but after I did some TMJ exercises of the jaw (isometric exercises, like pushing the jaw to left and right, from the internet), the pain in my ear and that went downwards from it, developed.\nThe medicine that I'm taking these days, which is Amitryptiline 10 mg twice day, has relieved the tension in my neck muscles which used to come along with the ear and jaw pain, but the ear and jaw pain remains. Last night I also noticed popping sound in my ear while talking. I don't hear the usual clicking when opening the jaw wide or closing it.\nSir, I'm quite scared to be honest, after looking at the horrible stories of chronic TMJ on the net, and seeing that my problem is also becoming chronic. \nI'm also enclosing some \"notes\" that I made during these months, in my email, regarding the fine points of my problem. I'm enclosing them here. These are a bit long, but I request you to please read them as that might help us shed some light on the root cause of my problem: \n1.) I want some device to fix at night between the teeth, to find out out if I'm actually grinding teeth or not.\n2.) Could the pain be because I sleep with my jaw open, on my back and without tossing/turning to sides, for the entire night?\n3.) I used to sleep on my right side for entire night, for 1 year, and didn't chew with it either. As a result, my right chewing muscles are thinner as compared to left jaw muscles. Also, now when I lie down at night, I feel that my jaw 'aligns/slides' more to the left side as com.pared to right side. Could the pain (which is mainly on my right side of jaw and which started after I sleeping on my back since 3 months ago) be because of this 'muscular atrophy' or 'change in muscles due to bad posture' or 'wrong alignment of the jaw due to sleeping posture'?\n4.) The pain in jaw increases visibly when I am using my neck muscles and they are in spasm, like when I work on computer.\n5.) Is there a Voveran injection that I can inject into neck muscles to relax them?\n6.) Is there an 'Range of Motion test' (in which an orthopaedic doctor asks us to make certain physical movements of the neck, along with the usual jaw movements that the Dentist does to diagnose TMJ Disorder) to find out if my TMJ pain is neck-related. I read about it on this link: http://www.round-earth.com/CervicalTests.html\n7.) What should I do to build my right jaw muscle which has reduced in bulk compared to my left jaw muscle.\n8.) My TMJ pain gets resolved completely when I take muscle relaxants like Flexon MR, or psychiatric medications: Clonazepam, Risperidone and Fluvoxamine, which were prescribed to me by Dr Rohit Garg (psychiatrist)\n9.) A doctor (Dr Amit Setia in Sirifort Road) suggested that I get my remaining wisdom teeth extracted, get a steroid injection my TMJ to reduce any inflammation there, and get 'plate' (which are like braces) to re-align my teeth. Another doctor (Dr Gagan Sabharwal in Fortis) also suggested that I get Botox injection too in my jaw muscles, to reduce muscle spasm and pain from it. But won't the Botox cause my right jaw muscles which are already a little atrophied as compared to left jaw muscles, to atrophy even more?\n10.) When I lie down and put my head to the bed a little fast and it collides with the bed, then I hear some 'small bone' in the left side of my head go 'tick-tick'\n11.) Should I get a bone density-scan for TMJ to see if there's degenerative bone loss.\n12.) When I lie down on my back, it sometimes starts feeling as if some invisible force/braces are pulling my upper teeth outwards. Also, while this is happening, if I take a deep breath or if I bring my upper and lower teeth together to touch each other, then the outward-pulling force on my upper teeth increases exponentially.\n13.) I have a feeling that the problem in my right side of face is because I work ONLY with my right hand on the computer, like holding the mouse, typing, etc. I think that tenses up the muscles in my right hand and shoulder and increases the pain on the right side of my face. Also, I keep only my right elbow on the arm-rest of chair while doing so while my left elbow droops on left side without being supported by any arm rest.\n14.) When I tap on my right TMJ, my forehead twitches A LOT. Is there a nerve in the area that is getting impinged.\n15.) Could this be because of fibromyalgia (maybe after oral herpes) or connective tissue disorder? Also, this TMJ pain started occuring after I took high dosages of Valcyclovir (herpes anti-viral drug) and Wysolone for a month? During this time i noticed that some wrinkles appeared on my skin and I had a lot of hair-loss, so could it be that after high doses of these medicines, the connective tissue in my joint degenerated because the wrinkles and hair-loss also happened because of damage to the connective tissues/collagen in my body, be it in my skin, hair or TMJ?\n16.) I used to sleep on my right side ONLY for the entire night for a whole year on a hard pillow, until it actually started paining on my right side of face. Could it be that sleeping on one side continuously damaged/changed the structure of my joint on that side, or that I've got fibromyalgia on my right shoulder and right jaw (whose muscles have atrophied due to sleeping on right side and not chewing from right side)? After that, I've started sleeping on my back for the entire night, and don't sleep on my sides (I tie my feet to to bed-post to avoid changed sides)\n17.) Earlier, the problem was only in my chewing muscle of right side of jaw, but after I did some isometric exercises of the jaw, I started having pain in the joint, ear pain and pain that went down right from my ear (both left ear and right ear) to the cervical along the edge of my jaw touching the neck. Could it be that due to the exercises, my TMJoint has become a little inflamed and a little lavage and/or steroid injection in the joint will relieve the pain/inflammation?\nAlso, during the time I was doing the isometric jaw exercises, I stopped putting night-bite guard, because of which I think my muscular pain in the right jaw muscle went away.\n18.) It feels that my right shoulder is at a different height than my left shoulder, and it feels that there is more tension in one of my shoulders than the other.\n19.) When I smile wide such that my teeth show while smiling, my lips' right corner opens up noticably lesser than my left corner.\n20.) I used to sometimes feel pain in chest at night in my heart area, and whenever I tried to take breath the pain increased more and more as I tried to inhale deeper. Yesterday, I filled my lungs with a deep breath despite the pain and suddenly I heard a 'pop' in my chest area, and suddenly the pain in my chest area vanished! So could it be heart related? AF05: Sir-  \n\nI am not clear how you have measured the weakness of muscles on one side of your face along side the negative correlation between sleeping on one side of your face and muscle weakness?  Also, have you been diagnosed with cerebral palsy before?  \n\n In addition to your visit to the Oral Surgeon, search for a TMJ specialist that you can visit. \n\nYour notes are vast and will take hours to discuss, so you need to share them with your physicians.  Let me know the updated treatment and diagnosis.  Thank you.  Af05 svor1988: If you sleep within 10 feet of someone they'd be able to hear the grinding- if you grind your teeth. Teeth grinding is a common drug side effect. Same thing with hair loss... I suggest you take only what drugs are necessary to allow you to function/work/live. As you've noticed drugs can cause a cascade of side effects, possibly treated with even more drugs by the psychiatrist... The strange sensations you are feeling (e.g. teeth pushing out) may be the drugs.\nIf your wisdom teeth came in straight, you don't need them removed. You don't need botox either. It's fine if you're a little asymetrical. Some people's eyes may be lower/higher than the other.\nRead about the parotid gland and parotoid duct. Some drugs increase the risk of salivary stones (calcification of saliva in the gland/duct). It may be that a calcified mass is causing pressure/pain in that system on your right side. Try searching for 'paranoid gland massage', e.g. apply heat.\nMake sure to read the side effects for the drugs you take. The FDA website maintains said lists.\nNot sure what the pop was in your chest. At least your pain there is gone.\nI've heard of the tick-tick phenomenon you hear under certain circumstances in your head. A friend in high school had that. I don't recall what it was. Something to do with the ear canal or something, sorry it was like 10 years ago I read about it. I think that condition may have been inspiration for the ticking Caption Hook (of Peter Pan) heard. IIRC it is a harmless condition."

    "dialogue": "Patient1: Hello,\n\nI had to have a lower molar extracted last August, and my dentist sent me to be evaluated for a dental implant which I decided to do. I followed the exact timeline they gave me and wasn't able to get the screw placed until January of this year because they said the bone needed to fill in. \n\nWhen the doctor who did the implant removed the metal button in May, he said that the top molar had extruded into the space where the crown should go and would need to be adjusted. I went straight to the dentist to be fitted for the crown. The dentist had to signicantly adjust the top molar to make room for the crown, so extensively that the area had to be numbed. The dentist assured me that this sensitivity would go away but after weeks of calling the office complaining of continued sensitivity in that top tooth, she said I would need a root canal. I didn't want a root canal, so she suggested a crown which I got last week. \n\nI have since asked for my money back for the implant because of how the process was handled, and they're not understanding why. I pretty much lost a perfectly good tooth and feel that they should have warned me that the tooth might extrude, especially because I tend to grind my teeth at night. Several people I've talked to said I should have had a temporary tooth in the space where the implant went so the tooth didn't extrude over that 9 month period. Or could the issue of the top tooth extruding be handled differently than just shaving it down? \n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience? I'm looking for guidance since I'm sure I will require additional dental work as a result, especially because crowns aren't lifelong. \n\nThank you. AF05: Hello... \n\nI am going to be frank and ask you: what makes you think that you deserve to get the money for the implant?  The treatment was done and you have a replacement crown now.    You can be upset about the rest of the issues that followed and the lack of information shared with you about the top tooth, but you shouldn't feel that you deserve to get any money back for the implant. \n\nYou could have had a temporary replacement on the bottom during the time the implant was healing, and that goes back to the initial conversation you had with the dentist.\n\n Regards, AF05 svor1988: Dental implants are not lifelong. Looking around I see estimates from 10-30 years on average before failure.\n\n\"Or could the issue of the top tooth extruding be handled differently than just shaving it down?\"\nI'd say yes. The teeth extrude if nothing on the other side opposes it. Shaving it down would be immediate. A longer term approach would have not killed the molar (e.g. wear a mouth guard at night). That dentist should be liable for that molar, as you said for its expected life. Consider speaking to a lawyer in your state/country for a free consultation. Some jurastictions may award damages for unnecessary pain. Years ago I think I saw a case similar to yours after searching for 'implant malpractice'.\n\nYou're right a temporary tooth should have been used- one was in my case. I'd report this procedural failure to both the dentist's state medical licensing board (there should be a web form) and your insurance company.\n\nYou grind your teeth? That is a common medication side effect. If you take a medication daily (e.g. antidepressant) review its side effects to verify it is there and then treat the ailment differently to prevent your teeth from wearing down."

I have tried everything I can think of to dislodge it and it is really stuck. I keep hoping it will dissolve on its own, but being something like gristle I am thinking it may take a long time for that to happen. It does not cause any pain. The \"pit\" has been in my tooth for a long time and has never been an issue. So I am trying to decide whether to wait and see if it dissolves or falls out on its own, or go to the dentist.

My dentist as already told me he won't make me a permanent set as it's a waste of time as they won't fit due to my bone loss , the temp set I have I can't wear as they are such a poor fit even with glue they will only stay in maximum of a hour less if I have a warm drink. I am losing weight, can't talk properly etc without teeth he told me my only option are implants and said he would refer me to see someone and they would cost around 6 to 8  thousand pounds which is not possible for me, what happens on the nhs for people like me who can't wear a denture? My whole life as been turned upside down I now don't go out wouldn't dream of going for a meal with family /grandchildren now as I'm embarrassed to have no teeth any advice please svor1988: I'd rather be toothless than have implants done personally. It's a year long procedure with lots of pain and bad complications (e.g. permanent numbness, improper placement, chronic infection). Look up implant malpractice for some horror stories. Mean time before implant failure is 30 years. Implants require sufficient bone as well, and cause bone loss once placed. Makes me skeptical of your dentist saying there is not enough bone for dentures yet there is for implants?! Sorry I can't be more help. That money is better spent on your kids.\n\nSince your dentist won't give you new dentures, If you have a lot of free time and good hands (or a family member's) you can buy inexpensive DIY denture materials online, and make the dentures yourself. If they don't fit right, you make a mistake, or even grow out of one you can make a new one the right way. Think of this like an art/pottery class, you mix the powder with water and set it in the mold of your mouth you made. There are a lot of scams/ads and upselling I had to look through, don't fall for them and maybe ask one of your kids to help you ignore them. Don't buy a mold kit which has you ship the mold you took to a company that makes the dentures. A helpful guide I found said materials were <$50 aside from the dremel and dental flask/vial thing. It was ~20 for the acrylic teeth and ~20 for the powders/etc. Sorry I can't link to it on this web site. Look for a guide that goes from ingredients to the finished dentures. Good luck! AF05: Please DO NOT listen to the above advice, and speak to individuals whom had experience with lower dentures, over dentures, or hybrid dentures.   These are the typical options you have to replace your missing teeth ( not replace your teeth)   \n\n To claim that Implants take one year is incorrect.  In addition, complications do exist like anything dental/ medical profession; thus, seek help from a knowledgeable dentists in this field.   \n\nSure, the treatment can be costly, but ask your self the following question:  if I had a heart attack, would I question performing and paying for the medical surgery?    of course NOT...... so do you question fixing the dental issue you are suffering from.  You are losing weight and nutrition, and soon medical imbalance/ issues will follow.  Please, take care of your self and don't build a denture your self.  Regards,\nAF"

The dentist said we will have to remove the tooth and make an implant because a root canal success decreases drastically after the first time. Now thing is this is not hurting me, sometimes I burst it but no pain whatsoever. Am I doing harm by not taking out the tooth please? Thanks svor1988: So the cyst has surface access as you say you can burst it? Has it not occurred to you or your dentist to attempt to clear the infection through that route?\n\nTry soaking for ~10 mins a night in salt water as you would with wisdom teeth. And alternatively with other antibacterial regimens.\n\nI'm going to say a strong no implant! Dental implants are not permanent- look up their life expectency. Often they cannot be replaced after their end of life due to bone loss. Further there are many more complications and costs to you which are trivialized or not addressed. Such as many sick days from work, months/years of pain, trouble eating, nerve injury, sinus perforation, improper placement, and even titanium allergy. Look up 'dental implant malpractice' for some horror stories and a reality check. Don't blindly trust what your dentist sells to you as I did.\n\nBy pulling the tooth, if necessary, the teeth behind it naturally move forward to fill the gap. Replacing the tooth is not necessary. Roderick: Yes it (cyst) comes and goes occasionally on the gum right underneath the treated tooth. Have seen 2 dentists none of them mentioned treating the infection as you are suggesring but replace the tooth with an implant! Therefore I did well not to heed their advice and the infection can be treated without pulling the tooth? Please note I have been like this for years now svor1988: That is upsetting to me. Placing an implant over an active infection is like setting it up to fail. Do not get an implant.\nAs the cyst, and pus has surface access, logically you can treat it yourself. When you press on it (a bubble/blister) you get a strange/sweet taste in your mouth? That is pus.\nTry 1-3x a day alternate soaking that area in salt water, and other things such as fermented pickle juice or fermented sour kraut (available at whole foods, organic stores, and maybe Kroger). That bacteria would not colonize your mouth as the current flora is. They'd kill each other, hopefully enough to get your body to finish off the remaining infection and fill that cavity with body tissue. This is all my theory... So if it doesn't work you could try asking for an antibiotic mouthwash from a doctor.\nOther people would know more than I why that root canal has a cyst under it in the first place. Perhaps a root was not sufficiently cleaned of infection and filled by the dentist who performed the root canal. Roderick: I do not think any taste in particular, a little blood comes out when its big enough that I can press it. It used to be much bigger when it surfaced originally. svor1988: Hmm just blood? Weird it should be pus!? Stagnant blood should eventually become tissue?- I guess there is still infection in a root that your body can't quite reach to clear out, thus the cyst formation and years of that blister being there. Sometimes when performing the root canal proceduce they can't clear out the root if the root is kinked to much for their tool, or they make a mistake and don't drill down enough into the root clearing out the infection. Sorry I'm inexperienced/unknowledgable there. You really should find someone more knowledgeable than I or look through some literature for some ideas. Searching for terms like 'dental abscess blister' or something?\n\nGet a dentist to treat the dental abscess. If the infection spreads laterally it may kill other teeth via traveling up their roots- I read that somewhere. Look into localized antibiotics over the typical tablet antibiotic...\n\nI had a chronic infection as well, but before the root canal. After the root canal, things got worse. Extracting the root canaled tooth solved the issue and a lot of my bone loss grew back. I did not replace that tooth.\n\nIf you extract the tooth look at the roots to see if they were not filled?\n\nEdit: revised the above. Sorry a lot is speculation so be skeptical. Use your own noggin."

When I moved in with my boyfriend a few months ago I would often wake him up from the sound, so I bought an OTC mouth guard, the kind that you microwave and then bite to form. After a couple weeks wearing it I noticed that my front teeth hurt when I woke up in the mornings. I stopped wearing it after about a month and a half and bought a more expensive OTC guard that adjusts to fit different mouth sizes and only sits on my back teeth. Now after wearing that one for a couple months I'm noticing my back teeth hurting in the morning and being tender throughout the day, enough to make eating uncomfortable. I also noticed that I have bitten the guard hard enough that small chunks of the plastic are coming off. This seems very extreme for a guard claiming to last 6 months. \n\nSo my question is, do I just need to replace the guards more often than most people or is this something abnormal? Is my Bruxism severe enough to warrant some other kind of treatment, and if so what should I do?\n\nThanks for any advice svor1988: Teeth grinding is a common drug side effect.

Look up the common side effects for the drugs you're taking.\n\nFor your health and your teeth's, consider either lowering your dosage, changing to alternative drugs, or cease seeing psychiatrists and go see a therapist/psychologist instead.

What is this and what do you reccomend? Dr David Lee: Hi Antonio,\n\nSensitivity to cold is a very common issue that many patients face. It appears that the front teeth have some recession, where the gums have receded away from their original position. When that happens, part of the root surface of the tooth is exposed, leading to the sensitivity that you are experiencing. The most common source of gum recession is due to aggressive brushing. Make sure that you are using a VERY soft/soft toothbrush, and not using too much force when brushing to prevent it from progressing in the future.\n\nTo help with the sensitivity, you can try rubbing a small amount of SENSITIVITY toothpaste (ex. Sensodyne) near the gumline for 1 minute and leaving it on there. Do this after you brush your teeth and before bed. By leaving the toothpaste there, it will have a more prolonged effect.\n\nHope that helps and don't hesitate to ask anymore questions!"

She has a bridge in her mouth from a car accident 22 years go. It is anchored to her top 2 K-9's. The bridge is 6 teeth wide including the anchors. It is permanent attached.\n10 weeks ago, one of her K-9's broke that was holding one side of her bridge. Before it even started to hurt, I took her to a local dentist. He looked at it and said he doesn't know what do do with it. He suggested I take her to the LSU school of dentistry. Got an appointment with them 2 weeks later. They looked at it and said they can't pull the broken tooth because of the infection starting to set in. Then they said once the infection has been taken care of, come back. He would break the other K-9 and then do a root canal and put new caps then fit her for new dentures. 1 week later, we returned. Come to find out, the infection has not gone away but has in fact gotten worse. So me gave her another script for another antibiotic. Next appointment 3 weeks later. At this point, my wife is in agony. The second round of antibiotics did not work.The dentist then said there is nothing else he can do. \nThen we went to her primary care Dr. He gave her another antibiotic. Some kind of big ole horse pill looking things. 2 weeks later, the paid is starting to subside just slightly. I took my wife to the emergency room to try and her some kind of relief. They called in an oral surgeon. They said the infection is too bad to pull the broken tooth or to even mess with. They then gave her something for pain and yet another round of antibiotics and an appointment to see the same dental surgeon in 2 weeks. The infection is still there. They can't do anything.\nAt this point, I have spent a lot of money on dentists etc.. for them to give her antibiotics. All of my little bit of savings are now gone.\nSo, after 4 antibiotics and no relief, what else do we do? Keeping in mind, I am flat busted. I lost my job a few months ago so we no longer have any income. Any home remedies to kill the infection?\nShe wants me to just get pliers and pull it, but i know that would be opening another whole new can of worms. svor1988: Not a professional doctor here...\n\nIt may be viral, or a bacterial strain antibiotics do not work on.\nChemo resets the immune system. It may be that she's infected with a trivial bacteria/virus that typical antibiotics do not target. E.g. they found a strain of bacteria from the dirt of flowers were killing a lot of people in the hospital (patients with no immune system). I believe there are many bacterial strains that chemo drugs target? A chemo doctor might know. If the infection is accessible a culture can be made, then they can know what it is before prescribing something random again. But professionals would charge $ for those services...\n\nHome remedies I recommend for teeth surfaces are fermented pickle juice and fermented sour kraut, let sit there every night for pain. I.e. Let the bacteria kill each other. Those strains won't colonize teeth. If her infection is inside the tooth this certainly won't work, and I'd have to go with what her body is telling her; to pull the tooth. My chronic infections went away after that in my case, I was glad I listened to my body there. If you do it yourself leave the blood in the socket, if removed socket will still heal but be deeper. Make sure you got all roots (for canine there is just one). Dentist charged me $200 out of pocket for pulling it... I wish I'd have shopped around first for quotes.\n\nmoxidectin applied topically (a gel ~$15 horse dewormer from agriculture stores) will numb the gums pretty deep (don't know if that'd help tooth pulling). Tastes aweful though. Alcohol (beer/wine) would be the only other cheap OTC numbing agent I know of. svor1988: Oh, try salt water soaking too. Ya moxidectin should work now that I think about it. Numbed my whole tounge with less than a pea size. Feel free to test it on you to know how it'll effect her. It often has praz-(something?) With it. They're both often given as dewormers to people in third world countries as they're inexpensive. In the u.s. they have something else that starts with an 'a' that doctors prescribe for worms, the main argument for it being it doesn't cause liver failure or whatever if overdosed on- but it's like hundreds of dollars for a single pill. So... Anyways. Moxidectin numbs amazingly but i'm not sure through what mechanism. It tastes and feels like a topical numbing agent i've had in a dentists office before as well (so it may be the same or some variant). Hope your wife gets better."

I've brushed my teeth 2-3 times a day since I had a crown/root canal a few months ago, i have throbbing pain throughout my mouth on both side all over, no wisdom teeth removed yet. I'm 21 and pain has been constant for a week or so, getting extremely irritable and it's starting to effect my work, I don't have insurance and can't afford another $3,000 proceedure svor1988: Hard to tell from picture. Could be food lodged between tooth and gum? Try scratching it up and out. But you said pain all over so probably a pathogen.\n\nAcute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis? Do you smoke?\n\nA DIY remedy attempt would be to try immersing affected areas in fermented pickle juice or fermented sour kraut juice 10 minutes 1-2x a day. Needs to be active fermentation (room temp) as then the bacteria will kill each other, the hope being the fermenting bacteria will win. Some stores sell them (e.g. Whole Foods, I hate Whole Foods). Kroger stores might have one. I guess you could also try leaving non fermenting ones on the counter for a few days till they bubble. If that were my mouth that would be what I'd do, worked for me last time after advice from a friend. From 3 weeks of increasing stabbing pain to no pain within 3 days.\n\nNo idea what pathogen you have. You could culture it yourself and look under a microscope- see sites biology stack exchange for help identifying it. A dentist wouldn't know either and would prescribe some hopefully effective antibiotic (oral or rinse). You'll get a \"I can't help you\" if that doesn't work... been there. Gee thanks for leading me on taking $1000+ before telling me that...\n\nAnyways. Your toothpaste is obviously not cutting it. So change the environment. Spicy food/mouthwash/garlic? Garlic is a good antifungal/biotic. Not as good as the fermenting stuff, but they'll each only work for a set of things and not others. Anyways, good luck!\n\nP.s. someone more knowledgeable that I could certainly give better advice from their experience. Bmyers: I got antibiotics from the Endonotists I used to get my root canal they said it should clear it up svor1988: Interesting.\nOh, salt water rinsing too may help.

He packed it and it felt better but today the numbing has worn off and it feels like someone took a meat cleaver to my face.

Is it healthy to leave the same packing in for the entire healing process? svor1988: Emily said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIs it common for dentists to not prescribe pain meds? In my experience yes that is uncommon. Typically they prescribe either a more concentrated ibuprofin dosage (plus a small bit of narcotic IIRC?) or just a narcotic like loratab. I disliked that personally given the addiction potential, they way overprescibed. Eventually I just started tossing the scripts... You should be fine with OTC ibuprofin or booze. I've had sockets with zero pain.\n\nAnd yes it's healthy, IIRC do not remove it! Read up on socket healing. High correlation between leaving that initial thick blood there and a better heal and shallow socket. By cleaning it out you will get a permanent deeper socket. Don't brush it out when brushing teeth, don't suck on straws, and don't rinse forcefully, let it slide/drool out. Then again it is your mouth and you have the freedom to do whatever you want. Just be aware a deeper socket is considered worse (how it is worse I don't know). Emily: Thanks for the reply. When I woke up this morning the pain and swelling was mysteriously gone with the exception of a few mild throbs. I feel heaps better. The dentist said just let it fall out when it wants to. The packing can make the healing process slower since it's a forgin body. I'm a little confused as to why the pain disappeared so fast but I'm not complaining lol."

    "title": "Been through hell the past year",
    "dialogue": "Daniel S: Last summer I had to get major dental work done. I didn't take good enough care of my teeth so I'm living with the consequences. Most of my teeth weren't salvageable. Dentist extracted 19 teeth, couldn't fix most but I've had bridges, implants, root canals and a partial upper denture to replace the teeth missing from top. A year later it is miserable to put on the dentures. Not because they look bad but they feel horrible. I've had them adjusted many times but it's still there. I started working a job where I have to talk a lot and it's so hard! Can't pronounce some words clearly, mouth is dry 24/7, and my upper denture feels like a weight pulling my mouth down. By the end of my day or shift I'm exhausted from talking. How do people cope with this hell I've endured for a year? Also I wear contacts for poor vision. Since my procedure(s) my vision has gotten much poorer, could this be coincidence? svor1988: Dry mouth is a big issue for your remaining teeth. From my reading saliva both fights/prevents tooth decay and there is some sort of remineralization activity on enamel.\n\nMy theory is that by consistent long term inflammation (due to dental work), saliva is unable to be secreted properly. As it stagnates in the glands/ducts, it may calcify, forming salivary stones which continue to cause dry mouth even after the inflammation ceases. You may be able to feel the stones, and they may or may not show up on xrays. Research salivary stones if you think that may be the cause. Dry mouth could also be due to something else, e.g. it is a common drug side effect (esp. antidepressants). If stones are the case and massage will not remove, a novel non-surgical treatment is using ultrasound to break them up; should be much cheaper too.\n\nPoor vision? I've read very few people have adverse reactions to titanium (implants) even though titanium is widely considered inert to the body. Something about the nervous system or immune system? You can research that too. Makes me seriously wonder why there isn't an allergy test to see if there will be an adverse reaction prior to the nigh irreversible placement in the bone...\n\nI don't know enough to speak about the other issues, other than you have to relearn how to speak due to structural changes in your mouth. I've had my own implant misery. I feel it and the associated chronic infections due to improper placement will be my cause of death when I am old and unable to fight it off anymore. Wish I never signed up for them, trusting the doctor as a naiive 18 year old... Good luck! Daniel S: Thanks for the knowledge. Seems like everything has gone downhill with my sinuses, eyes and mouth since I had this done. There's nothing worse than helping a client at work, then your mouth dries, contact falls out and/or burns in front of him/her. I can't do my job the best I can with these conditions. I can fix my vision with higher strength contact lenses but I'm concerned it's a byproduct of the procedures and issues with my mouth. I just need to find 2 upper bridges to fill in gaps and I'll be denture free. Might be the happiest day of my life svor1988: Daniel S said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tSeems like everything has gone downhill with my sinuses, Sinus issues too? I had chronic infections up there for 4+ years. The improper placement was an implant a few mm up into my sinus cavity. 2 CT scans later within a year the freaking ear/nose/throat doctor told me how to irrigate the sinuses with saline water. Got rid of sinus pain quick each time. Not happy with him. I intend to file a complaint.\n\nA well cited study claiming implants into the sinus cavity is safe had placed an implant breaching into the sinus of a dozen(?) dogs. They culled then disected the dogs to show lack of infection or whatever. Thing is, is that the implants were only in there for 2-4 weeks before they killed the dogs. It was a very short period of time... And yet in two citations encountered they both paraprased it is safe...\n\nA case study I found later regards one patient with never ending chronic sinus issues ever since an implant was placed breaching the sinuses. The did a biopsy/culture of above and below the implant (i.e. one through nose adjacent implant and one from mouth adjacent implant), and found flora had propagated from the nose into the mouth and visa versa. This was the cause of the sinus issues- bacterial species normally found in the mouth propagated up the implant and flourished in the moist dark sinuses. I believe similar issues can occur with teeth roots from root-canaled (dead) teeth. I think the authors in that paper speculated that the new industry practice of 'sandblasting' (I.e. rough titanium surface to make post harder to remove) caused problems with regards to bacteria- something about hard to reach resevours where the immune system fights back infection, can't reach small pockets of bacteria, the bacteria mutates, then spreads again, causing an indefinite tug-o-war. An interesting tangent is that nurse who had Ebola freaked everyone out after it came back. It had been wiped out according to blood tests- my suspicion is that she had a sandblasted implant. Pure speculation of course \n\nReading elsewhere advice is to leave at least 3mm of bone between implant and sinus, with the claim bacteria can propagate through less. That was on a rather nice dental forum, way more academics there, where doctors showed pictures, explained what went wrong, and asked for advice. Lots of improper implant horror stories there...\n\nSorry this web site appears to not allow links.\n\nOh, and in my case, after frequent nasal saline irrigation coupled with the removal of the adjacent root-canaled molar led to the bone in the sinus growing up 1mm over the implant. How on earth it grew ~4mm in total to submerge the implant I have no idea. I rarely get flare up infection by the implant now, thankfully that window to the sinus had closed. That whole ordeal with chronic infections had caused significant necrosis in my palate and elsewhere though. At its worse my left eye had swollen shut and i felt great pressure from beneath it.\n\nI suppose I should be grateful the ENT doctor didn't force a surgial sinus floor lift- no more surgeries for me thank you very much. I'd rather die.\n\nSo... In short, search for how to do a sinus saline rinse. Do this every time you feel pain or discomfort up there. Don't use too much salt. If the salt burns, then do it again with just water.\n\nAlso keep track of your profile xrays of you upper jaw. Look up the anatomy of the sinuses. Pay attention to how the floor of the sinus moves with time with respect to your teeth/implants, and how your sinus issues correlate. I think it's only the back three molars or so that are at risk of breaching the sinuses (maxillary sinuses? I forget the lingo)."

I've always had plastic and although these feel the same, and sound the same to me, the DDS office staff said they are porcelain. Can you tell by a photograph?

Zuri Barniv: I think the front 6 teeth are porcelain and the dark metal you see in the plastic confirms that, as they are attached differently to the denture than plastic teeth. Look very closely at the front 6 teeth and you will see the difference. Not 100% sure, but that's what I can see from the pictures. Jax: Hello Dr. Barniv, The lower goes onto implants, that's the metal. Many Thanks! Zuri Barniv: Either way, without touching and feeling them I can't know for sure, but I believe the front 6 are porcelain from what I can see in the picture.

Further they billed me $63 more out of pocket this time even though it was only one filling they'd failed on the first time?\nIt fell out again less than a month later.

I noticed a horizontal line that perfectly divides my lateral incisor in two. It is almost unnoticeable to the naked eye but when I place a phone flashlight behind the tooth it is easily visible. It does not cause me any pain and appears to be greyish in color. I was hoping it was a craze line, but that doesn't seem to be the case based on the fact that a) it stretches across the entire tooth and b) it is horizontal. i chipped my front tooth pretty badly from falling face first into concrete a few months back and fear that i may have additionally fractured this tooth without realizing it, although I would hope my dentist would have noticed and notified me if that were true.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Mohsin Patel: Hi George,\nHorizontal cracks on incisor teeth is more common than one would expect. In most cases, this is usually a 'hairline' cracking which only propagates through the enamel. Hence, it is usually harmless.\nUnfortunately,  the biggest concern is that over time it tends to pick up staining which makes the cracking appear more obvious and unsightly. Therefore, in the future you may decide to have a composite restoration or veneer to improve the aesthetics of this tooth.\nVisit my page on composites and veneers if you want more information on these treatments for the future.\n\n[link removed by admin] \n\nI hope this helps."

I had X-rays taken of my teeth and according to those, I only had 4 very small cavities in between teeth. I mentioned the issues I've been having with my teeth to my dentist but she didn't seemed too concerned. After my appointment I also realized that my dentist never actually looked at my teeth...just the X-Ray. And the Hygenist didn't even bother looking/cleaning in the pits of my molars. Is it possible for cavities to not show up in an X-Ray? I've attached pictures of what I believe are cavities in my teeth. If someone could look at them and give me their opinion, that would be great! Thanks! Plaza Dental Group: By viewing your snap I can say it’s a case of cavity but as a doctor I have to analyse you live in order to detect your oral problem. Dentists use x-rays to find cavities, abscesses, and pathology of the teeth and jawbone. X-rays show small cavities that would not be visible until they had gotten very large. The treatment for small cavities is usually easier and more economical than treatment for large cavities. X-rays may also show the beginnings of an abscessed tooth that has not yet begun to hurt. Detecting early abscessed teeth on x-rays can prevent future pain in a tooth. X-rays may also show cysts and tumours around teeth. Found early, the treatment is usually less involved. Your dentist will advise you when x-rays are necessary."

My teeth have been severely affected since, most are now gone, and the few remaining ones rapidly deteriorating. I need help but do not know where to turn. My insurance premium is too high, the dental coverage not as adequate, and I cannot afford the bills even with what my insurance will cover.

Please please help I am very concerned for my teeth. Thanks Plaza Dental Group: Read your query; as you have bleeding gums while brushing this is a sign of gingival inflammation this can be due to some reasons such as: - Good oral hygiene is not maintained (deposition of food debris sub gingival areas of gums). Improper brushing technique or Use of hard bristle toothbrush. I will suggest you to maintain good oral hygiene, use Soft bristles toothbrush to brush your teeth twice daily. You should make sure that you're brushing, not scrubbing! Use regularly mouthwash like Chlorhexidine or Listerine. Avoid gum irritant like tobacco containing products (if you are taking). You should consult Oral surgeon for visual examination of oral cavity and Scaling (oral prophylaxis) for healthy gums. Hope I have answered your query,. aminah: The main cause of bleeding gum is the buildup of plaque at the gum line. This will lead to a condition called gingivitis, or inflamed gums. And you mention that you have gingivitis.  Plaque that is not removed will harden into tartar. This will lead to increased bleeding and a more advanced form of gum and jawbone disease known as periodontitis.\n\nSo do consult with your dentist immediately."

I guess I was just a bit lazy to re register at different practices, but it now means that I have not been to the dentist since I was 18 (I am now 31). \n\nI have never had any issues with my teeth. I brush daily and I am an avid, sugar free, gum 'user'. My teeth are not sensitive, nor have they ever been sensitive. My worry is that if I now go to the dentist and the dentist starts 'poking around', they may irritate something. \n\nIs there a dentist out there that may be able to comment on what I should do, or alleviate my fears about the fore mentioned 'poking around?'.\n\nThe reason I am now asking, after all these years is because there is a tiny black dot (I guess decay), on both sides of my mouth, third (I think) molars (side not top). I have scrubbed but I can not remove. Worried that this could form into a hole. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks\nStewart"

    "dialogue": "NickyCymbals: I had a filling done by a new provider (mistake #1). 5-weeks after tooth is still sensitive to any temperature of fluid. I had provider take a 2nd xray and check for issues. She states nothing looks wrong yet I have sensitivity. \n\nTook xray to previous provider who saw 1 problem right away. Had him re-do the filling and he states he found 3 issues with original filling; loose, not closed, cavity not fully removed.\n\n4-weeks after filling being redone it is still sensitive to cold fluids and pressure. Went back to provider and he tested for root canal but tooth didn't respond. \n\nAt this point I'm miserable and just want to be free of the sensitivity. I don't care if he does a root canal but he says it should heal. I've had this sort of filling done before (between teeth) and don't recall it taking this long to heal.\n\nAny thoughts on best next step? Plaza Dental Group: After read your query, I would say that there are a couple things you should do - first go back and see your dentist and have him or her check your bite - sometimes if a new filling is just a little bit \"high\" it may cause your tooth to have trauma when you chew/bite and in time that tooth becomes very sensitive.  After that, have the dentist check the vitality status of the nerve - sometimes when you have a large cavity or filling, the tooth (nerve) may die over time and you will have a lot of discomfort when you chew - if this is the case, you need a root canal.  Finally, sometimes when a filling is very deep, it irritates the nerve of the tooth and if this does not go away over 2 weeks to a month it is probably time for a root canal.  Next step is to go back to your dentist ASAP.  Good Luck. NickyCymbals: Thank you very much for your reply. I've tried to baby this tooth as much as possible over the last 3-4 weeks and it is still sensitive to cold temperature. The bite alignment does not feel like the issue. I've had many alignments done in the past so I am familiar with this. \n\nI agree a root canal seems the best course of action. Thanks again for your reply."

In my opinion, the truth this early removal of wisdom teeth is actually much more traumatic than a wait and sees approach which leaves asymptomatic wisdom teeth in place and only removes them if pathology develops in the future. Hope this will help you. Dr David Lee: There is quite alot of differing philosophies or opinions on how to treat wisdom teeth.\n\nIn general, I have an educated conversation about the pros/cons of both sides. \n\nBy looking at your panoramic x-ray, it appears that your bottom wisdom teeth will never fully erupt. This can cause problems occasionally in terms of having infections around the gums of the wisdom teeth (pericornitis). This occurs because food, bacteria, and plaque is trapped underneath the gums of wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted. As well, wisdom teeth are often hard to clean because of their location in the mouth. Without flossing and brushing properly between the wisdom tooth and the tooth in front of it, cavities can often form on either teeth. Those are the most common risks of leaving the wisdom teeth in place.\n\nThe pros of taking out the wisdom teeth now is that you are younger, and your body has a better healing capacity. Some people also prefer to have the wisdom teeth out before they become a problem. While it is possible to have the wisdom teeth be asymptomatic, there is always a risk that they will become a problem in the future.\n\nEducating the patient on this, they are able to make an informed decision themselves on what they would like to do. Hope that helps!\n\nPS. You have an extra wisdom tooth on the upper right! Plaza Dental Group: In my opinion, the truth this early removal of wisdom teeth is actually much more traumatic than a wait and sees approach which leaves asymptomatic wisdom teeth in place and only removes them if pathology develops in the future. Hope this will help you. Plaza Dental Group: This x-ray shows wisdom teeth that are coming in at very awkward angles. The upper wisdom tooth is pointing toward the back of the mouth and the lower wisdom tooth is pointing directly at the molar in front of it, which can potentially damage that tooth. As you can see in the x-ray to the right, the upper wisdom tooth is pointing backwards and the lower one looks like it is going to run into the tooth in front of it. Many wisdom teeth try to erupt into the mouth by pushing on the molar right in front of it.  This can make it easy for the adjacent molar to get a cavity.  It can also cause the gums to recede around that tooth.  This can sometimes severely damage the adjacent molar that both it and the wisdom tooth need to be extracted. When a tooth is just sitting inside the jawbone for many years, it can form what is called a dentigerous cyst.  This cyst can eventually turn into cancer. I would say as many wisdom teeth develop cavities. If someone can’t clean their wisdom teeth, then it’s a good idea to get them taken out before they cause pain and problems."

A year later, during my annual exam, she said that the filling had cracked and needed to be replaced. I never heard of a filling cracking after just one year (I have fillings lasting 30+ years!) so I asked her why it cracked and she shrugged her shoulders with a \"who knows?\" look on her face. Not satisfied with this brush-off I decided to get a second opinion from a different dentist in a different community.\n\nThe dentist I saw for the second opinion told me the first dentist was in error and that he could not detect any crack in the filling, either via x-ray or with a visual inspection. This dentist was patient and answered all my questions and let me satisfied that there was indeed no crack in the filling.  After thinking about it, I decided to go back to that dentist for my regular annual exam this year.\n\nJeykell and Hyde.  This time around he was rude and condescending. Worse, he now is telling me there is indeed a crack in the filling of that exact same tooth and that it needs to be entirely drilled out and replaced.  Now, I suppose it's possible that over the last eight months a crack developed but I'm really skeptical.  I don't have any pain or any problem with that tooth.\n\nSo I'm perplexed about what to do. I don't want to go back to my original dentist to get the work done because she was the one who messed up the filling to begin with.  On the other hand, I no longer trust my current dentist anymore either because apparently he  got it wrong last year. I could attempt to find a third dentist  to take yet another look at that tooth but my insurance won't cover it.\n\nSo I'm perplexed.

    "dialogue": "Asdf: I had a cavity that I had neglected and it got to the point where I was getting toothaches after eating certain types of food that would last a few hours.\n\nI haven't been to a dentist in about 8 years and never had to deal with a cavity before.\n\nI called a dentist and told them what was happening and that I thought I had a cavity and they had me come in to get it checked out.\n\nThe dentist did an x-ray and did a cold test on the tooth which showed that it was way more sensitive than the other teeth. He told me I didn't need a root canal and gave me a composite filling. He told me it would be sensitive for some time after.\n\nShortly after the local anaesthetic wore off, I was eating a hamburger and experienced the worst shooting pain ever in my life the moment I chewed into it with that tooth. The tooth was also extremely sensitive to cold and sensitive to heat.\n\nAfter a couple months it was still sensitive to pressure but not nearly as bad, but still just as sensitive to temperature. I visited the dentist again and they told me after testing it that because it was such a deep filling, the tooth isnt healing right, that the nerve is slowly dying and that  it's most likely going to need a root canal.\n\nAfter some time I started getting toothaches from time to time usually after using the tooth to chew. They adjusted the bite a couple times until they finally took the tooth out of my bite, but the tooth aches got worse and more frequent. It finally ended up getting really painful and then suddenly the almost all the sensitivity went away. It was still very painful and felt like something sharp was clamped around the right side of my mouth.  It was the weekend so I couldn't come in, but they prescribed an antibiotic that handled the pain within a couple day.\n\nWhen I saw them again they told me they did an x-ray and found that there was an infection and that I definitely needed a root canal.\n\nIt's now about 6 months since the original filling and i just had the root canal done.\n\nThey had not informed me that there was a high risk involved in my situation thus misleading me a into getting a filling where I otherwise could have made a choice to look into the less risky alternatives such as Pulp Cap or Vital Pulp Therapy (avoidrootcanal.org). If they had honestly told me about the risks and I decided to do the filling anyways, then that would be fine, but they didn't. This conveniently led me into needing a Root Canal and giving them almost another $1800 over the $300 of the original filling.\n\nI tried asking for at least a discount of the amount of the original filling, but they blamed me for the fact that I let it get so bad in the first place, that filling aren't 100% and that I was already told I was going to possibly need Root Canal and they can't control it if the tooth decides to die and that they gave me the service I paid for.\n\nI tried to argue that they did not inform me of the risk before giving me the filling and that the tooth immediately had a problem after the filling but I might as well have been talking to a brick wall. It just seems like they were just trying to bend the facts in order to not have to take responsibility for screwing me over.\n\nI honestly feel like rightfully I shouldn't have to pay for any of the work done on that tooth because they failed to inform me of the risk before doing the filling which denied me the ability to make an informed decision on the matter.\n\nDo I have any sort of recourse for this? JImmyF: I hear you. This is the exact same thing I'm worried about in regards to my own tooth. The underlying issue is one of ethics.  You suspect your dentist set you up for failure in order to maximize profits. Is that the truth? I don't know. I do understand the concern because I share it. More broadly, I think this is part of the problem with health care in America generally.  Insurance companies cut reimbursement rates and so the medical professionals respond by increasing volume which lead to further cuts in rates in order to contain costs and a vicious cycle sets in creating a landscape littered with suffering patients subjected to a lot of unnecessary pain and expense. \n\nWhat compounds this situation is that there are a lot of grey areas. Maybe the dentist really did do what he thought was in your best interests and maybe it just didn't work out.  Maybe. We all want to believe that the doctor is working in our best interests but sometimes that just isn't so. Asdf: Thanks.\n\nThe issue here I see now is informed consent. Regardless of the intentions of the dentist, are they not required to tell me what the risks are before performing a procedure?\n\nI've since found out there's a biomimetic dentist nearby that has a much higher success rate in saving teeth with deep cavities compared to just doing a standard filling. They carefully clear out the cavity and use a special bonding material that mimics the enamel of the tooth to rebuild it wheras the standard composite resin filling requires a significant amount of drilling out of the healthy structure of the tooth so that it will stay in, composite fillings actually require 30% more of the tooth to be drilled out over the old mercury fillings even.\n\nWhen the dentist told me I didn't need a root canal and told me I needed a filling there was no warning that because of how deep my cavity was that it would be risky. So, either he was negligent for not telling me or incompetent for not recognizing the risk.\n\nSo I was screwed out of the chance of saving my tooth which ended up costing me thousands of dollars for a root canal and potentially causing me serious health issues down the road and they won't even refund me for the original failed filling."

It was a very large filling. \nAbout a year ago it fell out as I was eating a cookie so I went back to the dentis who said he is going to try and re fill it but as its so big I might need a crown or extraction. He refilled it and the filling came out a few weeks later, he tries to refill it again and then the filling came out again and again and this time he said to me if the filling comes out again then we're going to need to do a crown. One week later the filling came out again. It's so large that I think there is an exposed nerve as I can't drink cold drinks without extreme pain. Now I know if I go back he is going to do a crown or extraction if I choose. Now I cannot afford a crown so if I have to have one I have to wait a long time before going back so I could save money to get it done. An extraction would be much better in my financial situation. So I am just wondering if I had it removed and not replaced would I have even worse problems? I am not sure what to do, if I have a crown I am going to have to wait a good few months before I can afford it. Has anyone got any advice? PlacidWay-US: @Sanriodia if you're living in US then dental crown would be more costly. About teeth extraction I think it would be  a better option if you can't really afford to have crowns. Through teeth extraction you can also save the sorrounding teeth.

She was vague but then she is also a non native English speaker. She proceeded to place it in my mouth and being the trusting/ gullible/sucker that am, I really want to believe that it is true and it is disinfected... I like the dentist and think they have done a good job so far and don't want to burn any bridges or make a scene if this is common but am concerned about this being \"best practice\" given that the crown, i believe, is going to be placed under the gum line (they tooled around there and i assume it is therefore more susceptible???). Is there a solution that would make disinfecting /sterilizing this possible? And yes already swished for minutes with mouth wash...\n\nThanks in advance for any light that can be shed on this..."

    "dialogue": "Chloe235: Hi everyone,\n\nI went to the dentist today and he pointed out gum recession on my bottom two front teeth which I also noticed recently. It is around 1.5-2mm. The dentist said that it is due to braces that I had as a teenager pulling my bottom teeth forward, damaging the bone and resulting in general weakening in that area. He said that at the moment he isn't considering anything regarding surgery as he doesn't see a need as long as I can maintain the state that they're in at the moment. I heard him going around my mouth measuring pocket depths and they were all 1 or 2 with one 3, so there isn't an issue with gum disease. \n\nHe suggested just maintaining my normal oral hygiene regime ( brushing twice a day, flossing once ), but is there anything else that would be recommended? I cannot afford the gum graft surgery, which would be about £1000, anytime in the near future, so keeping these at the state they're in for as long as possible would be ideal.\n\nThanks!"

You cannot expect complete result in it. \nYou should try to reduce your addiction of alcohol and smoking. It will reduce yellow color of your teeth. artofsmile: Stop smoking as soon as possible! nicotine stains are truly hard to get rid off. Habit of eating junk foods and drinking carbonated drinks/aerated waters gradually causes eroding of enamels.At,every morning start flossing after brushing your teeth.Rinse properly after each meal. Now a days, some non sugary chewing gums are recommended by the new aged dentists which helps to retain the whiteness of teeth and also helps to restrain oneself from smoking to some extent. If your teeth really looks ugly, then you should opt for flawless and long lasting teeth whitening in some renowned dental clinic in your vicinity and should obey the instructions of your dentist henceforth. CraigRWS: I personally recommend whitening pens, they're just so convenient, then a gentle whitening toothpaste to compliment that. It's tough that your afraid of the dentist as the scale and polish is the best option, perhaps visit a dental hygienist in a private clinic, they're much more relaxed and patient friendly I've found. SacredGal: I hear you about being scared of the Dentist , I was the worlds biggest baby , so much so my Dentist told me he has never seen anyone so scared , but for some reason I did a 180 , now I look for reasons to go , I just love going , first you need to stop that smoking thing , I tried to stop for 40 years , the thought of cancer or a heart attack was not a good enough reason for me to stop , what got me to stop was after I had Zoom done , the difference in my teeth was so shocking I instantly quit smoking Enrique: You don't need to fear dear!! teeth whitening procedures are mostly painless and also are done without using any injections. You can always consult other dental clinics to know what they had to offer to you and which helps to ease out your phobia as well."

    "title": "Can this overbite be fixed, do you think?",
    "dialogue": "SeaUrchin: Hi. I am a 17 year old male. Since the age of around 8 or so, I've had an overbite. However, it's never had any significant effect on my appearance, however that changed when I was around 13. Since then, it's gotten worse and it makes my chin look significantly smaller due to the mouth protruding and vice versa. When I chew, it's rather difficult and I cannot chew without my lower jaw retracting. I'd also like to note that I've never had any problems with my mouth protruding/chin appearing small, however again, that changed when I was about 15.\n\nin addition, my old dentist was aware, and she gave me a retainer to wear when I was 12 years old. Stupidly, I only wore them for a month because I hated wearing it, and I guess this is the result, unfortunately. I also was a huge mouth breather when I was younger and constantly bit the collars of all of my shirts throughout the day up until age 10 or 11, so that may of had a toll too. Also, last year I was diagnosed with minor sleep apnea, which I know has some relevance, or I'd assume.\n\nFORGOT TO ADD: I have a lot of trouble closing my mouth completely a lot of the time.\n\nFor the most part though, my teeth are OK and straight. However, beside the overbite (it isn't THAT severe, but yes it's not good either), my front bottom teeth are also small and there is really no space between them, which might be another thing too. I've had dentists tell me during cleanings that it's hard for them to clean between the gaps of my lower bottom teeth because of how narrow/non-existent the spaces are.\n\nAnyway, I'd really like some insight as to what can be done here, as it's annoying when I eat (that's primarily why I want this fixed), and it also has a negative impact on my appearance. Then again, I am not quite sure if getting this overbite fixed would somehow make my mouth to not protrude as much (causing my chin to not appear as weak as it is now). I'm not expecting to have zero mouth protrusion or my chin to look like Brad Pitt's, but I at least want it to be a little different from what it is now.\n\nI've been told by a dentist online that braces and rubberbands can do the trick, however I'm not 100%. In any event, I'll be providing two pictures so you can make a quick judgement:\n\nFrontal: http://i.imgur.com/AQDKYkr.jpg\nComplete profile: http://i.imgur.com/TQ3w1Le.jpg\n\nNote that I have a relatively strong/large jaw, so I don't know what good lower jaw advancement surgery would do. Also you cant see in the pictures (or maybe you can judging by the full profile), but I have a very long face, so the protruding mouth which makes the chin look weird makes the entirety of my face rather asymmetrical. My goal is not to look like a model here, by the way. I just would hate the protrusion. DanyRoden: I think dental braces helps you, It takes a time but your teeth will be straight. Concern your dentist as soon as possible. \nHope my answer helps you. PlacidWay-US: I agree with DanyRoden, you may need to consult an orthodontist since they are the expert in this field. In your case you really need to undergo orthodontic procedures. Before most braces are for teenagers who needs to fix poorly aligned teeth or jaw structure. Now, more adults are getting orthodontic procedures done not only to fix problems with alignment and bite, but also to make the mouth look more aesthetically pleasing. Orthodontics can positively affect a person at any age, and can prevent further complications or damage caused by incorrectly growing teeth, jaw structure as well as conditions caused by illness or accidents. Good luck to you hope this can help. JJ_8613: Hi.\n\nI think your best course of action is to consult your dentist and an orthodontist.  The orthodontist will know if braces can fix this or not.  I've heard that braces can make an overbite worse, but that may vary on a case by case basis.\n\nYou also mentioned some crowding and small spaces between teeth.  At your age, the doctor may choose to take a watch and wait approach.  Pretty soon your wisdom teeth will come in and if they do this can make the crowding worse.  If that happens they may extract the wisdom teeth and any others they think are causing crowding.  If necessary they'd likely then put braces on you to close any gaps.\n\nIn the long run, only a professional can tell you this.  Make an appointment so you can get some better answers.\n\nGood luck.\n\nJJ"

I finished the entire course of antibiotics and anti inflammatory pills. But then a week later the infection came back at the same area (upper teeth, on the right side). I went to see the dentist again and she said it's probably because of how much pressure my braces are putting on my teeth. So she loosened my braces, and turns out there is less aching in that area. However, she said I couldn't take any antibiotics because I'd just finished an entire course a week ago. Instead she gave me some anti inflatory pills and told me to keep using the antibacterial mouthwash twice a day. After 2 days, my Infection doesn't seem to be gettin  any better - if anything it's gotten worse; the area below my chin (where the lymph node is), beneath my cheek bone and even below my eye hurt. So basically the whole right side of my face aches, although there isn't any visible swelling. Since I am unable to take any antibiotics to get rid of the bacteria, im afraid it will just keep spreading and eventually result in more problems to other areas of my face. I've heard of dental infections that have affected the brain as well, but I don't want to Think about it right now.. What should I do?

Rinsing daily with water mixed with salt, numerous mouthwashes (Therabreath included, I actually ordered it from abroad hoping it will solve at least the mouth taste/smell issue - nothing), I brush 3 times a day minimum making sure I get every bit of plaque. I went to a dentist who prescribed an alcohol-based mouthwash and a toothpaste of the same brand which is supposed to help - nothing.

Jonathan: Hi, has your problem been resolved yet?\nSo many things can play a factor in why your gums aren't healing up.\n\nAre you smoker\nIt can be worsened by other medications you might be on\nA different health issue might be the cause of the gum disease.\nI agree ask you general family doctor or dentist to refer you to a periodontist. You can also call you local dental society, they can provide you with names of practitioners in your area.\n\n--\nThanks,\nDr. Jonathan Everett Enrique: Gingivitis is a common and mild form of gum disease (periodontal disease) that causes irritation, redness and swelling (inflammation) of your gums. Because gingivitis can be mild, you may not be aware that you have the condition. But it's important to take gingivitis seriously and treat it promptly. Gingivitis can lead to much more serious gum disease (periodontitis) and eventual tooth loss. The most common cause of gingivitis is poor oral hygiene. Good oral health habits, such as brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily and getting regular dental checkups, can help prevent gingivitis."

On my most recent visit to a dentist, I was told that these fillings only help kids protect against cavities and bad hygene but need to be removed when you are an adult. The dentist also noted that I had \"brown cracks\" in a few places where he says bacteria are burrowing.\n\nThese fillings or teeth never bother me and I feel totally fine. \n\nHe said I need to get each filling removed ($50 each, after his \"discount\" that I don't even understand where it came from was applied).\n\nI researched online and found no such evidence for needing to remove a resin composite. I saw that metal ones need to be removed and so do those that cause cracks, pain, and other problems. \n\nSo my question for dentists is, am I being scammed into an expensive procedure?

The dentist recommended whitening before going to a lab to colour match the veneer and then have it put on. If I do as recommended and don't keep up the whitening will the veneer be whiter than my other teeth in the long run? My teeth aren't that discoloured anyway, so shall I just get the veneer done and not the whitening? \nAnd finally, if I got the veneer done and then had the whitening treatment would the veneer stay its original colour? \n\nThanks ever so much for your help in advance,\n\nSteph PlacidWay-US: Hi Steph, if you are very happy with the color of your teeth then there's no need to whiten them first. But if you prefer whiter and brighter teeth then consider whitening your teeth before you have the veneers placed. But since your dentist recommended it then you must follow him. Remember that veneers cannot be whiten. Any whitening done after the veneers are cemented will whiten the natural teeth next to the veneer but not the veneer itself, causing a shade discrepancy. Great Lakes Dental: Hi Steph, \n\nYou're correct, a veneer will not respond to a whitening treatment. The shade will remain the same.  \n\nI agree with your Dentist's recommendation, if you're getting a new veneer (especially being that it's your front tooth), then it makes more sense to do a whitening first (that is, if you value having a brighter smile...some people don't). Assuming you did have the whitening done, future discolouration will happen gradually and you should be able to maintain a near-perfect colour match with an occasional 'at-home' whitening solution. \n\nRegards, \n\nDr. Jennifer Thomm\nCosmetic Dentist\nSarnia, Ontario"

Is it common for teeth to be extracted after decay? I'm so worried about this, I hope it can get saved... It's one of the biggest teeth i have. zaheen: Dont know whether you have a decay or not,but you have to avoid chewing of sticky foods with the crown ortherwise most of the time it will fall out"

So 2 days ago I was cleaning my teeth and checked out my back wisdom teeth and they have this really dark brown almost black discolouring on front side only from near top to middle of tooth on front of tooth. Exactly same on other top wisdom tooth as well which is really weird. I am shocked I have never noticed this before and very embarrassed. Both top wisdom teeth don't hurt or can't feel any holes where the discolouration is so Really curious to know what it maybe? I have booked dentist appointment but can't get in for a week. I tried to take pic not very good but get an idea of what I am talking about. Anybody know what this maybe, I do drink Pepsi max not sure if it's related to drinking that"

Since Wisdom teeth don't descend into the mouth cavity until the late teens or early twenties (usually between the ages of 17 and 25, known as the \"age of wisdom\"). In your case I am not sure if it's partially erupted so you may need to undergo panoramic x-ray to see where the wisdom tooth is situated and if it needs to extracted especially if you feel pain."

They weren't bothering me before the fillings, but after I have had a constant ache that ranges from a dull ache to throbbing pain on that whole side of my mouth.  It is hard to pinpoint exactly where. \n\nTylenol takes the pain away, but it returns once the medication wears off, so I am taking Tylenol every 5-6 hours for pain.\n\nI went back to the dentist once already.  He examined the teeth and adjusted the bite; he also redid one of the fillings.  He tapped on the teeth and I didn't feel extreme pain from the tapping, so he said it didn't seem like a nerve issue.  He did say the fillings were pretty deep, and that if a high bite was the issue the ligament could be sore for a few more days.\n\nEverything was seeming better for about 24 hours. I went all day yesterday, from 8am to 6pm, without having to take Tylenol.  Then the pain returned.\n\nI am worried because I am still in constant pain, unless I take Tylenol.  I have another appointment to go back in a couple of days.  The dentist won't do X-rays because I'm pregnant, although my OB has said it would be fine as long as I am double-shielded.  Should I insist on X-rays to determine if there is a problem?  Or should I tough it out and just wait for the pain to go away.

I had a bad habit of not brushing my teeth everyday, and smoking also didn't help also.  \n\nI need some advise on how to keep my teeth/gum healthy while I save up money for implants...I feel I can start going to a dentist 2 years from now, but during the 2 years...I need to start a good habit taking care of my teeth.\n\nAny advise anyone?  Thank you so much DanyRoden: It's a good thing that you aware of your teeth health but for your missing 5 teeth only option is implantation. Start Brushing regularly 2 times in a day and take advice from dentist to save other teeth also. \nGood luck Dear. SeaUrchin: Depending on where you live, I'd think insurance would cover this. I think this would kinda count as an injury, I'm probably wrong. PlacidWay-US: Hi liberrtines, based on what you said you really need dental implants. Let me ask first, where you from? I agree with @SeaUrchin insurance could cover this procedure or can lessen the cost. But if you're from U.S that would be a problem since dental work in U.S is really expensive, but there are some other options which many american choose. By traveling abroad specifically in Costa Rica and in Mexico you can have the procedure done. Since you're planning to have dental implants done 2 years from now you should know or at least have an idea how much you need for the procedure. To give you some insight about the cost of dental implant in Costa Rica it starts at $750 depending on the type of implants. So i think you can start saving and for now you need to take good care of your remaining teeth, dental hygiene is really important you can also go to your local dentist for detal check up and cleaning. Also stop smoking and avoid too much coffee it may stain your teeth and that would be another problem."

    "dialogue": "sportskiPozdrav: 2 months ago my molar tooth hurt on cold and sweet so I had to change my \"silver\" filling and now I have \"white\" one (I don't know much about fillings so I call it silver and white, sorry). Then 1 month ago it started to hurt again (it hurts for a few seconds on water and sweet again, so not a few minutes, just under minute) so I went to another dentist and he changed filling, gave me another \"white\". It is deep, he also put something on the bottom (a \"medicine\" for root, don't know how to explain it better) and it was good for about a week. Then it started to hurt again on water and sweet (not on bite, not spontaneously) but this time a pain lasted for a few minutes, then all is cool. So, I did x-ray and went to third dentist, because I'm student and my previous dentist is from other city. Third dentist said my x-ray is good, there is nothing wrong with tooth or nerve/root. She then found a smaaaall crack/hole on side of the tooth where that white stuff meets tooth , so she put some \"white gel\" or whatever and said it will probably be better, but if it's not then she will put a new white filling and eventually , root canal. This last thing said all 3 of them. After her treatment I feel a much smaller pain on water and sweet again which lasts a few seconds. So, my question is, why would she say I need root canal if pain continues when there is nothing wrong on x-ray and there is nothing wrong when they are looking into my mouth? No one found any cavity. And second question is, is it true that white fillings needs sometimes few months to settle? Like, some people can feel a pain when they drink water for a few months after a deep white filling on molar. (I read it somewhere on internet, even that third dentist said she needed 6 months for her tooth to stop hurting after filling)\nVery sorry for a wall of text. Oh I also would like to say I'm SUPER scared of rooting canal.\n\nP.S. I wrote this yesterday so update is it hurts on water and fruit (not warm water) , on sweet food sometimes yes sometimes not. SamTheDentist: Hi there,\nYour tooth has a deep filling, that means is close to the nerve (which is in the center of the tooth) , if the wall between the filling and the nerve is too shallow (deep filling) , then if you eat anything with different temperature it will be passed to the nerve earl quick causing your pain, regardless of the material of the filling.\nThis tooth either will have less pain with time, if the nerve is still healthy cause it will adapt to the new environment and everything will be find, might take couple of months.\nOr you have same/worse pain, that means your never is infected already (cause the bacteria has been inside the space through the very thin wall left under the filling), then you will need a root canal.\nThat's all the story sportskiPozdrav: Ok, cool, so I wait and see what will happen with a pain. \nI bought Sensodyne Rapid tooth paste for sensitive teeth today and it actually helps. I mean I still feel water but a loooot less. I wonder if this tooth paste is just temporary solution or it will heal it somehow...I guess it's just to help me until my nerve decides to cooperate with filling  \nThanks for answer!"

I only care about health, longevity and cosmetics, and cost (but I do have Delta Dental).\n\n* More and more dentists seem to reward patients for good reviews.\n\n* Dentists pay each other referral fees, don't they? So to what extent can dental referrals be trusted?\n\n* The \"Top Dentists\" publication in Seattle Met is showing 700+ dentists in no particular order. That's more dentists than I thought practice in Seattle, how do they find enough teeth for everybody? That's not helpful at all. Besides, could that voting be \"doctored\", too?\n\n* One would think having a professor from a prestigious dental school would work, but I've heard of a well-known professor who did not do a very good cosmetic job (did not get the right hue; must be color-blind)\n\nSo, I am at loss. At this point, I am willing to pay a good money for a referral. How do I approach it? I need an implant, too, among other things.\n\nBTW, I am a programmer, and am considering a few programmatic solutions to fix this informational void. Would any dentist or front office specialist be interested in working with me on it? If it can be done, it can be big. Great Lakes Dental: Hi impatient patient, \n\nApologies, since my office is located in Canada and no doubt our systems function differently. Nevertheless, have you tried 1-800-Dentist? My understanding is their service works to address exactly the scenario you've described. You could also check Facebook to see what people are saying about a particular office or Dentist online. If you're having difficulty trusting those sources, then perhaps the old-fashioned way of asking around would suit you best. Good luck. I'd be interested to know how you arrive at your decision, once you get to that stage. \n\nRegards \n\nDr. Jennifer Thomm\nCosmetic Dentist\nSarnia, Ontario impatient patient: I'll try 1-800-Dentist. I wonder on what basis do they choose whom to recommend? I know that many (non-dental) organizations here in the US choose not to refer people out of fear of liability - crazy I know.\n\nNever thought of Facebook. Here, we have Yelp, but, like I said, Yelp seems increasingly doctored (by giving patients perks for a review for example), and also patients seem to not know a good dentist from a bad one, or at least it's been my impression. Dentists here will correct me if I am wrong.\n\nHow do I know a good dentist when I see one anyway? Perhaps there is a good question to ask, that only a good one would know an answer to? iamdoctor: I think you must take help of local search directories.\nHere are some list :-\nYelp\nGoogle Local busines\nYahoo\nJust type dentist and name of city and they will show you an entire list.\n\nRemember:- Before consulting read user reviews. If a dentist has lots of positive reviews than call them and ask for appointment.\nAlong with search about the dentist on google as well.\n\nYou will find many ways to get authentic information about seattle dentist. Great Lakes Dental: Hi impatient patient, \n\nThe reason Facebook is more reliable is because people must actually stand behind the things they say online. So even if a Dr, encouraged one their patients to give a good review (through some kind of 'perk'), that person still needs to believe in what they're saying otherwise they'll be advocating someone to their friends and family that they don't actually hold in high regard. The system isn't perfect, but in terms of trusted reviews, Facebook is more reliable then most other online 'anonymous' sources for exactly the concerns that you've expressed. \n\nIn terms of what to look for, here a few quick tips:\n- What school did they receive their doctorate from?\n- Review your local dental board website. Most dental boards (like our RCDSO in Ontario, Canada) make disciplinary actions public. \n- Check out the office, does it look clean and up to the standards that you'd expect from a health care provider?\n\nHope this helps and good luck. \n\nDr. Jennifer Thomm\nCosmetic Dentist\nSarnia, Ontario"

I used warm water with sea salt rinse it thoroughly twice in a day. It really helped me. You have to try it. Jonathan: I'd recommend calling or going in to see the dentist who did the procedure. They will be able to take a look inside your mouth to make sure things are healing up as they should be and that there are no complications.\n\nThe lump can be pus building up (If your cheek/face starts swelling then it can definitely be an indication of an infection), the lump could be a blood clot that forms there during healing, or simply because of irritation to the area, which will go away. Canker sore could have formed due to the surgical stress in that area as well. \n\nAfter the extraction of a wisdom tooth, there is a pretty substantial cavity made in your jaw were the tooth once was. This takes a while to fill in and heal over, during this filling process the cavity can be very delicate and sensitive.

I was very happy with the dentist; she was very careful and gentle was hopeing to have her when it came time for the permanent to be installed.\n\nUnfortunately that didn't happen. The dentist greeted me nicely but that was the end of the good bed side manner. First she put the jel thingie in my mouth and waited for about a minute before taking it out. There was no numbing of my gum (before I go any further the tooth in question is [don't know it's number] the upper right canine). After removing the jel stick she immediately stuck me; more pain than with other dentists.\n\nShe began wiggling the temp but it wouldn't budge and I was feeling some discomfort so she got the needle out again and this time she really stuck me, considerably more discomfort (real pain this time).\nShe got the temp crown off and installed the permanent one. So far so good my jaw was too numb for any discomfort.\n\nAfter the anesthetic wore off the pain began. Touching the tooth was not just uncomfortable but downright painful. I could not chew with that tooth. The next day the pain increased and continued at that level into the following day. Now, I am not one to panic over the mouth pain but it was strong enough that the next day I went back to have it checked. The dentist I was becoming to dislike checked the bite and took some material off the tooth which because the lower tooth was no longer touching it seemed to at least relieve the discomfort.\n\nThe pain moderated over the next two weeks but has come back.

    "dialogue": "strozni: Three years ago I had my tooth(first premolar – 4th one upper row to the left) fixed with endodontic therapy, but the problems started a couple of months later. Tooth started changing color to grey. They redo the whole process, tried to mask is somehow from the inside, and from the outside, but nothing was satisfactorily. In the meantime I've noticed inflammation up from the tooth, slightly to the back(5th tooth). I've changed dentist at this point, and started to take antibiotics. Inflammation was gone, but only for a couple of weeks. It didn't hurt at all, so I stupidly kind of left it as that for a whole year, or something like that. Then I finally decided to sort that problem out, so I went another dentist who proposed endodontic therapy on 5th tooth, since he thinks problem is closer to that tooth. I don't have to say to you that it didn't sort anything. Then another dentist proposed apicotomy. I had it done, swelling was huge, and after a month or so, guess what? inflammation came back. I was sick of false diagnosis, so I tried private dentist. He said that the problem was not inside teeths, rather between 4th one and bone surounding him. So he proposed cleaning therapy and trying to save the tooth, and somehow regenerate tissue between tooth and bone. Didn't make sense to me, but I tried. Once a week I came to him, and he would struck a needle right in the spot and clean it with a mixture of iodine 5%+tobrex+and Listerine(mouth-wash). It worked. Over a period of 3 months inflammation was gone. But! After a year and a half inflammation was back, same spot, same thing. I have X-ray photos, so can somebody please suggest something, it's driving me crazy, and implant is my final and 2-wages-expensive solution.\n\nPictures: strozni: Long story short:\n- 4# RTC\n- 4# changed color, then re-did RTC\n- inflammation appeared\n- antibiotics, inflammation temporary reduced\n- pause everything for over a year\n- 5# RTC, failed\n- apicoectomy 4#(5 stisches scar), failed\n- inflammation returned, no pain\n- cleaning with:5%+tobrex+and Listerine(mouth-wash) and needle for 3 months\n- inflammation gone for year and a half\n- inflammation returned, no pain\n- don't know what to do\nPictures are latest ones Becky: Your topic went into a moderation queue, but I have approved it for you now. Zuri Barniv: There may be a fracture in the root of one or both of these teeth and no amount of root canals, apicoectomy procedures or cleanings of the bone can fix that. The dentist can check if there is an \"isolated deep pocket\" which usually confirms this. In such a case, your best bet is removal and an implant, bridge or something else. I cannot make a recommendation since I haven't seen it, but my guess would be a fracture.\nDr. Barniv"

I went to the dentist who said it was cracked and he removed the old filling and put in a new one. Doesn't seem to have worked though as it is still sensitive. What should i do now? I'm only 36 so i don't really want to lose a tooth. Dr.incase: I would say it always depends on the situation, and your dentist is the only one who can tell for sure since he can see how much tooth structure you have lost. if the crack was big where you have a near pulp exposure and the pulp is still vital, your dentist probably added some calcium hydroxide under the filling to give some time for the pulp to defend it self. so the tooth might be sensitive for few days but then if the sensitivity fades away that mean his plan has worked. again it is all depend on the situation, this is just one possibility. there are some complex restoration that can be done on a fractured tooth, they are usually filling supported by pins, if you have one or more cusps of your tooth broken but you still have enough tooth structure. you may also need some endodontic treatment if the pulp is exposed and dead but your dentist would have told you that if that has already happened.\nBest advice is to go back to your dentist if the sensitivity remains, and ask him what is the best way to proceed, I won't worry much about loosing the tooth if your dentist haven't mention anything about loosing the tooth or haven't told you that it is even a possibility\nGood luck and hope your tooth get better.\n\nDental Student.

I need to travel for three weeks shortly, do you think it's ok if i wait until i get back? Just a bit worried about a toothache although the dentist said he sealed it and flushed the tooth. The sensitivity after a tooth filling should resolve within few weeks and that is normal if the filling was too deep. I'm assuming you are still within this range of time and haven't passed it, also your bite is ok (you don't feel the tooth is high when you close your mouth). if you are sensitive to hot, cold, sweet, and pressure, try to avoid them for now, also use desensitizing dentifrice (Tooth paste) such as Sensodyne, you can buy some over the counter pain meds to help relieve the toothache. Have a safe flight, and if the sensitivity persist after few weeks, please re-visit your dentist to make sure everything is ok."

    "dialogue": "Trent C: Hi, I have recently been very frustrated and scared about the condition of my teeth. First off let me say this is indeed my fault. Going through my teen years I never really looked after my teeth. I was not good about brushing and rarely flossing. I was blessed with thick enamel sadly, I have neglected taking care of it and lost a lot of it. The last time I went to the dentist about 8 months ago I have my first two cavities (age 19 failure to floss cavities) and was told I have quote \"very thin enamel\" (I am guessing relative to someone my age). Due to the lack of cavities before this was my first wake up call. Oh, and I did do a cleaning twice a year all throughout my youth. Since I have being trying to take much better care of my teeth and watching what I drink. Paying closer attention to my mouth now I have noticed that are teeth are no longer smooth and have indents in my teeth that I can sort of feel them by running my finger nail over them and I can see them if I shine a flashlight at them at certain angles. I have also noticed I have white spots on my some of my teeth throughout my mouth. I have a few mildly yellow teeth these teeth seem to have a rigid in the smoothness of my tooth towards the top of my tooth (guessing the deference between more minor and more severe enamel lose). Due to my work I will not be able to make it to a dentist for the next 3 months. This has been causing me a lot of feelings of self loathing and depression over the past couple weeks. Am I destine for a future full of costly dental bills or do you think I may have smartened up soon enough? Thanks a lot for you time!"

I also did a fluoride treatment today but it still feels the same.. the dentist said if it doesnt get better, a tooth cleaning might help. What may be causing this problem as the two dentists did not give me an answer and what can I do about it? Great Lakes Dental: Hi faysal, \n\nTypically the sensation you've described would be associated with inflammation of the pulp within your tooth (see diagram below - the pulp is the portion with blood/flow nerves, directly above your canals). The dental term for the condition your experiencing is Pulpits. There are several potential sources that could cause inflammation within your pulp: \n - A deep cavity\n - Erosion of your outer tooth enamel, exposing your dentin\n - A crack or fracture in your tooth\n - Dental work associated with having a deep cavity treated\n\nPulpits can in some cases be treated & reversed. Similar to what your Dentist has recommended, professional cleanings, fluoride treatments, remineralizing: rinses, pastes, powders and other products can all help. \n\nIf the symptoms persist, and the infection has reached your pulp, then the tooth will need to be root canaled. \n\nHope this information is helpful. \n\nRegards, \n\nDr. Jennifer Thomm\nCosmetic Dentist\nGreat Lakes Dental\nSarnia, Ontario Canada"

My senior year of high school I had some jaw problems where I’d wake up in the morning and my jaw would be really sore and whenever I chewed or opened it to a certain extent it would pop and click, sometimes painfully. It was annoying but I kind of just learned to deal with it. Then, this August, I had my wisdom teeth removed and since then my jaw problems have worsened. My jaw hurts to move in pretty much any direction. I can’t open my mouth very wide anymore. One side of my jaw usually hurts more than one, but the side switches all the time. Sometimes I'll wake up and my left side will hurt really bad, and other mornings it'll be the right side. Right now, I’m worried because my bite seems off. I can tell that something is different and wrong, but I’m not exactly sure what. It’s like the molars in the back right side of my mouth don’t touch together anymore, and when I try to bite down on that side of my mouth it hurts SO bad. I can’t even chew on that side of my mouth right now. I went to see a dentist about this at the beginning of September and they said it could be TMJ so I had a night bite guard made, but it’s basically just a clear, very thin retainer for my top teeth and it has done absolutely nothing. I am so frustrated and I don’t know how much more of this I can take. I just want my jaw to go back to normal. Can someone please tell me what’s wrong with my mouth? Thank you.\n\n- Julie Pearce Zuri Barniv: I would ask the oral surgeon who did the extractions for help. Also, a well adjusted night guard is the key to success. If your dentist handed you the device and said 'bye', that is not a well-adjusted night guard. It usually takes 30min or more of adjustments to fine tune it to your joint and then it might help you. \nDr. Barniv"

    "dialogue": "Cameron: Hi there!\n\nI am hoping someone can help me!\n\nOn Monday afternoon I had a filling on my bottom left molar due to it being cracked. By the looks of it it was quite a deep filling. I had about 3 injections of anesthesia into my jaw (I think) which caused it to feel tight up until yesterday. However, the tooth on the TOP left has a constant tingling sensation and feels a little sore. I went back to the dentist on Wednesday and she said it should just be from the anesthesia seeing as it went through the muscle tissue (or something like that). She prodded it a few times but there was no pain. Sometimes the tingling feels as if it is coming from above the gum behind the top molar, almost as if it is coming from my cheek? Last night I also noticed that the tingling would dart from corner to corner of my mouth, but the funny thing is the bottom molar where I got my filling is not very tingly at all. I have been using sensitive toothpaste the last few days in the hope it might be sensitivity, but the feeling is constant!\n\nDo you think this is happening because it is the other tooth that is connected to the jaw? Has the anesthesia maybe disturbed something and it is just taking a wee while to settle back down?\n\nAny help is much appreciated! Great Lakes Dental: Hi Cameron, \n\nOften when fillings are deep, the process of drilling and filling can irritate the nerves around the site. Discomfort from the process can cause you to feel the sensation of pain coming from areas other then where you received your treatment. Another possible cause of discomfort may be from the strain put on your jaw muscles and ligaments or like you said, if you received 3 needles, that will certainly take time to heal as well. \n\nBottom line, I would recommend giving yourself two weeks to heal and let your nerves settle down (assuming your symptoms are limited to just pain). If you notice infection (swelling, bleeding, puss, bad taste or foul odour occurring inside your mouth), you'll need to return sooner. If after two weeks, you're still in pain, you may require a bite adjustment (a minor in & out procedure). \n\nSincerely, \n\nDr. Jennifer Thomm\nCosmetic Dentist\nGreat Lakes Dental\nSarnia, Ontario Canada"

My appointment for next week is set up to remove all my TOP teeth (due to finances, will be doing top and bottom teeth separately). The dentist prescribed antibiotics and two lorazepam tablets. He explained I will be numbed for the procedure of pulling ALL my top teeth and this just doesn't sound doable to me. I'm terrified. Is this normal? Is it common to perform such a major dental procedure without at least nitrous? All others I've spoken to were actually put under to have their teeth removed. Just not sure if I want to go through with it. Great Lakes Dental: Hi James, \n\nYou shouldn't worry, what you've described is entirely common. For many patients, extractions (full uppers or lowers) are done using just local freezing. You should have a denture fabricated and waiting that will help protect the site and promote healing afterwards.  The use of Lorazepam (which is not necessary in many cases) will help you relax during the treatment and make it difficult to even recall the experience (please make sure you've arranged for a car ride...you can't drive after taking Lorazepam).\n\nPain afterwards is moderate and offices will often recommend over the counter pain meds or offer you a prescription. \n\nHope this helps and best of luck, \n\nDr. Jennifer Thomm\nCosmetic Dentist\nGreat Lakes Dental\nSarnia, Ontario Canada"

I never went back. Ever. I don't know what did it for me but I just couldn't face going again. I remember even just flinching in the chair when the dentist came at me to scrape my teeth. The last time I just walked out and haven't been back since around 2000. Over the last 15 years my teeth had obviously decayed and started to rot. I eventually had some teeth out at the hospital under aneasthetic (put to sleep) and went to a dentist afterwards who gave me a temporary plate which even that scared me to death. It's got to a point now where I have only around 6 teeth on the top and 8 on the bottom and they are all bad. It's knocking my confidence and self esteem so much. I'm guessing the only option now would be to have the rest out and get dentures. I am going to telephone the dentist today nearer to where I live to see if I can register and see what he says. Basically the two bottom ones (the gums have worn down and it's showing bone). Could anyone give me a heads up of what I might have to endure? I am so scared. I know it's my own fault but I just kept putting it off all the time because I am petrified, but I know something needs to be done now. If anyone could let me know I would really appreciate it. Thank you \n\nMikey james warfield: If it's anything like what I've researched (I'm in similar shape), you can get knocked out, have them all pulled and some places will have you leave wearing dentures right away. You need to expect some pain, but you know how the anticipation of pain is worse than the pain itself. My problem...the doctor wants to extract all my teeth, like 28 of 'em, while I'm AWAKE. He gave me two lorazepam (useless sedative) and will use novocaine. I think he's insane but what do I know?

I couldn't control it. Anyone had this problem before? I don't wanna go back and same happens. \nThanks Great Lakes Dental: Hi Sarah1989,\n\nMany people experience anxiety while visiting their Dentist. In your case, likely it was the drill's pressure combined with the sound, that caused your body to experience a reaction. There are many options to treat dental anxiety, but the best one is simply finding a way to relax. I offer my patients the opportunity to borrow one of our office iPods. We have them loaded with selections of relaxing music, melodies and even binaural beats. Distracting yourself from the sound of the drill will take one major source of stress out of the equation. If your Dentist does't offer that, consider bringing music with you that you find relaxing or enjoyable. \n\nAnother trick is to simply keep reminding yourself that \"it doesn't hurt and it won't hurt\", often it's the perceived anticipation of pain that will cause people anxiety. Truth is, most dental procedures are painless, however if your mind believes that it'll be painful, that in itself can cause you stress & anxiety.  \n\nEducation is also effective at reducing your anxiety. Watch a YouTube video of a crown-prep in the comfort of your home. When you return for your next appointment, ask your Dentist to fully explain the procedure before starting. Understanding what's happening, when it's happening will help reduce your fear. \n\nOf course there other medicinal options: nitrous oxide (laughing gas), prescription drugs or sleep dentistry.  However it sounds as though you've been successful at the Dentist before (with your previous fillings), therefore I'd recommend that you try again (with the belief that you'll be successful) before opting for medication. \n\nHope this helps and let us know how your next appointment works out.\n\nRegards, \n\nDr. Jennifer Thomm\nCosmetic Dentist\nGreat Lakes Dental\nSarnia, Ontario Canada"

The typical little scratch you get.\nThen came the second needle!! And Jesus Christ i have never felt anything sopainful in my life.\nI have had these numbing needles before and its never felt or hurt that muchbefore.\nIt was so bad i naturally went to grab it in reflex and the dentist wasn'thappy about that lol.\n\nAnyway the numbness started to set in after about 5-10 minutes and i was readyfor the extraction.\nWhich by the way he said would be pretty straight forward and a standardprocedure looking at the xray.\n\nSo he began.....\n\nFirst he used what i would describe as dentist pliers. he grabbed to tooth andstarted going side to side..back and forth...the SNAP!!! The tooth snappedbasically in half. \nHis face changed and he said he will have to try something else.\n\nHe then got out what i'd describe as a thin metal spike, slightly bent on theend and proceeded to stab it into the gum area and attempting to lever thetooth out.\nIt felt like i was sat there for hours and hours it was hurting still and hewas really going at it. In reality i was sat there about 25 minutes with himdoing this.\n\nAnyway eventually the tooth gave way and came out aswell as the one next to it.However there was a big lump of my Jaw bone on there too which wasn't expectedby me lol.

(btw it was aback tooth i didnt mention this earlier)\n\nThanks for reading and i hope to get some replies pretty soon.\n\nRegards\nJamie Zuri Barniv: I am not sure what the lump is, but I have seen cases where people develop jaw joint issues after difficult extractions (almost always involving lower teeth). Look up \"TMD\" in a search engine and see if your symptoms match. If so, warm compresses against your joint (near your ear) and jaw exercises help. There are other remedies but we are not even sure that is what is going on. You might need to take more pain killers as well. I would call your dentist about it when they are open again. Ro3bert: Dr. Barniv, Sunnyvale, CA\nhttp://straightupdoc.com/\nLook up \"TMD\" in a search engine and see if your symptoms match. What is \"TMD\" I've had bouts of \"TMJ\" of and on, are they basically the same? I know with TMJ I often had trouble closing my mouth, painful, not a fun thing to have happen.\n\nI understand there may be a psychological component to TMJ\n\nRobert Zuri Barniv: TMD is temporomandibular DISORDER (which is the condition like saying you have a 'bad back')\nTMJ is temporomandibular JOINT (This is just the abbreviation for the actual joint - kind of like saying your 'knee joint' or your 'hip joint')\n\nThere is a psychological component, usually brought on by stress."

    "title": "Seeking currently available toothbrush as practical as before",
    "dialogue": "aDifferentLoginName: Over the past decade or so, I've found that toothbrushes have become more and more exotic, taking on all sorts of colourful and riply shapes, with rubber bits here, grip treads there, etc.  I have also found them to be increasingly inferior in terms of ease of manipulation to get the recommended flicking action.\n\nI've tried various models from the pharmacies, but it started to look like I'd have to go through countless models before *possibly* finding one that is actually designed with practical usage in mind. I don't know what's driving this gamififcation of toothbrushes, but I was alarmed about the fact that I would no longer be able to get a useful working toothbrush.  So I stockpiled.  Then I ran out.  \n\nI thought that I was lucky that the model I stockpiled still seemed to be available.  But even though it *seemed* to be the same model, they had changed the design.  The neck was pathetically flimsy, so you couldn't actually control the flicking action.  I contacted the manufacturer, and they basically were not making the old versions anymore: http://i57.tinypic.com/6drgw4.jpg.  The left diagram is the new fangled useless one while the right diagram is the bygone useful one.  Both Buttler-Gum/Sunstar model 461, but that's irrelevant now.\n\nMy dental hygenist was not able to recommend a good one.  They don't actually control the supply side.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else noticed the decline of toothbrushes, and whether they know of a decent one that is still on the market?  I should add that if the response is that I should move to a electric rotar brush, I use both.  I would like to continue using both. aDifferentLoginName: After confiding with my dental hygenist with my forlorn situation, she recommended Curaprox. I never heard of it before, and for good reason. It's not on the shelves either, and it's not even clear that I can have them ordered. I will find out tomorrow. And to be sure, even if I can order them, I don't know whether I will like the design. I will likely find out in a few weeks time when I get my hands on one. aDifferentLoginName: Here's the saga so far.  I picked up a curaprox toothbrush in a neighbouring province.  The verdict?  It does not address my problem of rotating the toothbrush in the recommended manner (sweeping motion from the gumline toward the biting surface).  It still feels awkward, as if I have very little levearage and control.  I should clarify that I find this problem specifically when brushing the inside surfaces of teeth on the lower right jaw.  (I'm right handed).\n\nHowever, I found a solution.  Simply use the left hand.  I found that this doesn't take too much effort to get use to.  In fact, maybe this was the intent of modern day toothbrush designers.  And it is apparently good for staving off dementia to get out of one's congitive comfort zone.\n\nHaving found this solution, I don't think it will be necessary to follow up with the Butler Gum Classic toothbrush.  None of the pharmacies in my hood are able to order them anyway, and I didn't much like the idea of paying an order of magnitude more than the cost of a toothbrush to ship it to my home.  And that's just to test it and determine whether they are as good as I remember.\n\nThanks to everyone who contributed their input into my posting thread. aDifferentLoginName: Just an update on the toothbrush saga.  After trying the Curaprox brush and not being satisfied, I tried the Gum Classic SKU# 311PC-C at http://www.gumbrand.com/classic-toothbrush-311pc-c.html.  I ordered 20 in order to get free shipping.  What I did *not* notice was that when I selected the compact head and soft bristles options, the title at the top changed to sku# 409PC (though the URL remained 311pc-c!!).  So I ended up ordering skads of huge-headed toothbrushes.  Fortunately, they accepted them back and sent me the right ones.\n\nUnfortunately, the 409PCs aren't quite as good as I recall.  The brush handles are too short.  They might be for kids.  And they aren't quite as easy to manipulate as I seemed to recall, at least for all areas of brushing.  For my use, they are not better than the toothbrushes that I want to replace (the model that started this topic).  \n\nOh well.  I thank all those who chimed in."

Then I get my teeth molded because I need to get a mouthguard because I grind my teeth at night. She puts the plate in my mouth and pushes it inwards and the fucking pain I experienced. No pain what so ever when she did the bottom gums I guess.\n\nAfter when I got home I realised this scraped a lot of skin of my gums and I have a little hole I believe on right side and its pretty painful.\n\nDoes this happen normally when you get your teeth molded? Cause the after pain is fucking hell.\n\nEdit1: I forgot to mention the skin on my upper gums also got really scraped and feels extremely sensitive. Great Lakes Dental: Hi Hinrik_Thor,\n\nUnfortunately what you've experienced is fairly common. If you take your finger and place it near the biting surface of one of your teeth and then slide that finger up your tooth toward your gums, you'll likely notice a protruding ridge whereby your teeth meet your gums. This ridge is often wider then the metal tray used to take your impressions (aka: molds). In essence, what happened is when she pushed the tray onto your teeth, the metal tray was narrower than your gums, causing painful (albeit minor) scraping. I don't mean to dismiss the pain you experienced. It is very painful but the good news is that there will be no lasting impact and the scrapes should heal within 1-2 days.\n\nWhether it's pain (like you experienced) or gagging from the material, patients have made it abundantly clear that they don't enjoy traditional impressions. As a result the industry has evolved and many dentists (including myself) are now offering technology that takes digital impressions. If you care to know more about this technology, I've posted a short demo video on my YouTube channel.\n\nWishing you speedy recovery.\n\nDr. Jennifer Thomm\nCosmetic Dentist\nGreat Lakes Dental\nSarnia, Ontario Canada Ro3bert: I just had impressions for a new bridge. The metal holder was a bit large so caused some discomfort (medical term for pain); it was too large for me. The tech had another more experienced tech come in to see if she could do any better. It turned out the first tech was trying to use a too large frame. The second tech much more experienced started using smaller and smaller frames until she found one of suitable size that was comfortable.\n\nThe dentist the OP was using must not have known there are various sizes of frames, at least that is my humble opinion.\n\nRobert"

    "dialogue": "Mint_Sauce: Hi all,\n\nI didn't know where to turn with my issue so hope it's ok to post here.\n\nI'll try and keep this brief (edit: I failed), but here's the current story:\n\nMade appointment with dentist for a vertically cracked tooth, occasional pain when biting on something hard but not too bad. (diagnosed by two other dentists one and two years previous but wasn't bad enough to do anything about at the time). Four days before my appointment it got very bad quickly. A lot of pain to the point I rang NHS 111 to get an emergency appointment. The NHS dentist said the back two teeth were vertically cracked drilled in to the first tooth and possibly the second to check, found decay, used a temporary filling and told me to tell my dentist what he had done.\n\nWent for the appointment with my dentist, I had paid privately to have a white filling (£200) on the molar. He looked at the tooth and said I could either have root canal, have it removed or try a band. I had to decide on the spot and I asked his opinion and he said it's hard to say but we could try a band as it might save the tooth. He put the band on and did the white filling. I went away and the pain returned as the local anesthetic wore off but thought it would go after a few days.\n\nI found that I couldn't close my teeth at all, the dentist hadn't shaped the filling to allow me to rest my teeth properly so my mouth was always open, I went back and he re-shaped it so I could close my teeth again.\n\nAfter returning home once again I quickly noticed my tongue was catching and bleeding on the band, it was very sharp and cutting it. I had to then return again to have that filed down.\n\nA few days later of pain killers, sleepless nights (I've had nothing but them for over two weeks now) and it not seeming to be getting any better I returned. He said it's probably better if it was extracted and he thought that would be the case. So he pulled it out with some wrenching, and sent me off. Things were still painful and I'm still unable to sleep, constant paracetamol and Ibuprofen but I left it for another 5 days to see if it would settle, by the third day I had a nasty taste coming from it along with it constantly aching. With immaculate cleaning and several warm saline rinses it settled down enough that I could concentrate on other things. Overnight however it would build up again and wake me in the early hours of the morning and not settle for hours (lots of mouth wash cleaning and salt).\n\nI went back today because I felt that progress was very slow and the pain was too much, he lay me back and said I had dry socket, filled it with the clove mix (no rinsing and I had green/black gunk in there and possibly some remains of my lunch) so now I'm worried he's packed this on top of stuff that's going to cause an infection. Right now it's the best it's been, still aches but nothing like what it has. He said to leave it in and to come back if I wanted on Friday (4 days) but it should be fine. Nothing about taking this clove thing out, I guess it's just left in to dissolve??\n\nShould I be worried and does this all seem standard stuff? I have an expensive extracted tooth, severe pain for over two weeks and even now I'm not 100% sure this is over with the packing without cleaning.\n\nThis is all for the first tooth, the very back molar (the one next to it) I mentioned a few times but he didn't seem to acknowledge it, so now I'm worried I have a temporary filling from the NHS dentist that's going to cause me problems in the future.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, I'm run down, anxious and fear things getting even worse before they get better. Thanks for any advice."

    "dialogue": "elizabetta: A few weeks ago I had all my old fillings refilled with composite fillings. I noticed when I brushed my teeth one of the teeth I previously had filled felt a bit sensitive. Now that same area has started to throb a bit. \nI also noticed that my fillings are starting to yellow, and it's only been a few weeks... I'm not a smoker, and I don't drink soda or coffee that could make it stain. \nI'm a bit concerned that my dentist somehow screwed up while filling the tooth that's throbbing.\nAnd I'm also wondering how the fillings are yellowing so quickly. \nAlso, my teeth still feel a bit sensitive when eating anything a bit hard or crunchy. I don't know if that's normal or not. Great Lakes Dental: Hi Elizabetta, \n\nFirst, let me say that replacing your metal fillings with composite fillings was a wise choice. \n\nIn terms of your sensitivity. There are a couple reasons why this could be happening: \n\n#1 - Removal of metal fillings will usually also require some removal of your natural tooth structure with it. This means that when your Dentist re-filled those areas with composite filling, he/she was placing filling material closer to your root. Therefore when chew on the affected tooth, your placing pressure on your root the didn't exist prior to the treatment. This is the normal cause of post sensitivity. Symptoms will normally subside within a few weeks. \n\n#2 - Metal fillings are mechanically bonded to your tooth. Composite fillings are secured through chemical bonding using materials that may result in temporary irritation. Again, symptoms would normally subside within a few days/weeks. \n\nI'm a bit of a loss regarding the new stains. Typically the shade of composite won't change much. It's possible that (since metal fillings are typically much larger then the areas filled with composite), that the area you've identified is actually your real, existing tooth structure and not the newly placed composite.\n\nHope this information helps. \n\nDr. Jennifer Thomm\nCosmetic Dentist\nSarnia, Ontario Canada\n519-542-3427"

    "dialogue": "Over9000: I've had calculus built up over a period of years since I had no access to a dentist for a long time. Before calculus built up my teeth weren't perfect but they were kind of within the bounds of normalcy. Even after the calculus built up, from the front they basically looked very yellow teeth but normally shaped and positioned aside from being somewhat crooked (though the backs had been built up quite badly with calculus giving the teeth a long appearance back there).\n\nAnyway, it built up a lot but I was finally seen by a dentist who would actually do something and he cleaned my teeth. The bottom front teeth weren't in good shape but the top front were in better shape. Afterward the top fronts simply looked whiter but the bottoms? The two front teeth on the bottom were thin, bent, and terribly spaced, looking strange and misshapen.\n\nNow I'm sure damage was done from the years of unfortunate neglect but they never looked like this before the calculus build up and not even right before the cleaning, only after it. So what happened? There's all this extra space and the teeth look super thin compared to the rest in my mouth, all the rest seem relatively normal...\n\nIt seems as if he damage my teeth or something. There's no explanation for it. My teeth always kept the same shape and then all of a sudden after a cleaning they're a mess. Also for the record, I read that the process should not hurt but it did, and also he was being extremely rough (I understand that you very well be gentle but he was using it like a jackhammer instead of a tool). Of note also is I felt something weird and then the doctor and nurse conversed i some type of dental code I couldn't understand, dunno if an accident happened or what but they sounded just a tad concerned.\n\nThe sad reality is that I'm only on Medi-Cal and the dentist gets payed regardless of what the outcome is like. This doctor has a history of being very cold as well. A mother brought her wailing child into the office and he was in extreme pain, some type of accident I think. The first thing asked was \"What type of insurance?\" Since they were apparently not properly insured the kid was sent away as quickly as they arrived. I understand it's a business but still.\n\nTL;DR: Had bad calculus for years, bottom front teeth were pretty bad but looked like normal teeth before the calculus and just before the cleaning; after the cleaning I have super messed up teeth, so what gives?"

    "title": "Crown Replacement Needed?",
    "dialogue": "Roscommon: Hello there, I have just joined this forum to ask a question which is concerning me at the moment, I hope someone may offer some advice or shared experience, I would be most grateful. \n\nI am based in the UK, male aged 48, and at my last check up a few days ago my dentist said my eye tooth crown was needing replaced because it had developed a 'gap'. He asked me how long I had had this crown and I told him approx 15 years. My previous, now retired, dentist who installed it, was excellent and made a fantastic job. He put in this crown after doing a root canal on the tooth.\n\nI have never had one single problem or issue with this crown, it has been indistinguishable from a real 100% healthy tooth. On looking at it closely with a dentist mirror I see nothing wrong with it at all. In general my dental health is good, and I have hardly had any fillings since childhood. My dentist calls me in every 6 months for a checkup, usually with no work needing done.\n\nI am very concerned about this crown replacement. I believe 'if it ain't broke then don't fix it'. And there is a risk something may not work out so well - the new crown may not fit so well or bond so well. And I am concerned, though I respect my new dentist, whom I have had for over 5 years now, that he may be needing some extra income and the treatment is strictly speaking unnecessary. Also if it went wrong I could not afford an implant, which costs £1000's.\n\nHe is though a very good dentist, and I would like to keep on good terms with him. I have dutifully turned up to appts every 6 month at his request. I have had disastrous dentists in the past whom I would never return to again.\n\nI just wonder what people think about this situation. I am VERY nervous about any dental problems arising. And there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with the tooth from my perspective. So why should I be burdened with this ?\n\nBut I want to keep on this dentist's patient list as I may need a good dentist one day in the future, and a good dentist can be hard to find.\n\nBut I simply don't want this treatment, it is totally stressing me out. But will my dentist be offended, if I make an excuse or keep putting it off ? Will he dismiss me as a patient because of that ? Is it feasible to get a second opinion on this crown ?\n\nSome people online have reported having tooth crowns for over 30 years without any trouble - and they can actually last a lifetime.\n\nSo that's it - any comments welcome! Zuri Barniv: A few things: First off, you as a patient cannot determine if a crown is OK or not based on looking at it in the mirror or by feeling \"nothing wrong\". Most all dental problems cannot be seen or felt until they are much more advanced and difficult to fix. Second, you contradict yourself when you say you respect and like the dentist but you think he is recommending work purely for profit. If you think the latter, then in fact, you don't trust the dentist and you should get a second opinion. Lastly, there is risk to every procedure and even ones that are intended to correct a problem. It might end up badly if you try to fix it or end up worse if you don't. This is why you and the dentist need to have a candid conversation about the risks of treatment, the alternative options and the benefits he hopes to realize. A dentist should not dismiss you from his practice for opting out of a treatment like this, but why don't you hear him out and see what comes out of it? There is nothing wrong with telling the dentist about your concerns and hesitations and then giving him an opportunity to elaborate on his recommendation. Roscommon: Ok, thank you sir. The part that troubles me is when he asked how long I had had the crown and I replied over 10 years - and then he said that was a good period of time for a crown to last. I was just not happy with this, given crowns can last 30+ years, and even a lifetime as one dentist said on his website. In fact I just spoke to my brother about this and he said he has had his crown now for almost 30 years and has had no problems at all.  The obsolescence argument just doesn't impress me too much. I would not wholly blame the individual dentist for over-treating if they are under some kind of financial pressure - it is the 'system' that is to blame.\n\nAlso he has given me two X-rays in last 6 months, and after the second a few days ago I have a sore neck under the area where it was directed, and I am concerned about the health risks of X-rays. Zuri Barniv: You cannot compare your brother's experience to your own, you are two separate people with two separate circumstances. You either trust what the dentist is telling you or you don't. It sounds like you have serious doubts. Does the UK system allow for second opinions? Also, the x-rays could not cause you physical symptoms you could feel over a 6 month period. You should be concerned about the health risks of x-rays, but dental x-rays have extremely low dosages when compared to medical x-rays like chest, abdominal, etc."

    "title": "Bone fracture during implant surgery",
    "dialogue": "Thomas: I had an implant placed on my upper premolar and during the surgery, according to my dentist, a portion of my jaw bone broke off near my cheek, exposing the implant underneath. He continued with the implant placement and added a membrane for support and some bone graft tissue. Should I be worried? What could be the cause of the failure? Is this a safe thing to do or should the implant be removed and the bone allowed to heal first? Zuri Barniv: Difficult to answer this as there are too many questions about what happened. But generally, if the bone around a new implant partially fractures, it is not necessarily a failure. As long as the implant is still very tight in the bone and the fractured portion is reattached and then covered properly, it will most likely heal fine. When you break your arm, new bone forms in the cracked portion as long as you keep it still (in a cast). Same thing here. It sounds like the dentist did everything right and you may suffer no long-term complications. Taking out the implant now could actually make things worse as the fractured area may come out with it. Obviously, I am speculating as I don't have an x-ray and haven't examined you."

Um, is this normal? I googled and apparently second molars come out at age 12 or something. (And btw, these definitely are my second molars that haven't came out.

I waited to see how it was in the morning and it's just as sensitive.\n\nIt aches in general now, and so much as lightly touching the filling causes a huge surge of pain.

They told me I had \"a couple cavities\" between teeth and before I knew it they were trying to sign me up to have them filled. \n\nI got the impression that the cavities were small. Do I really need to get them filled or can I wait until I have insurance? I just felt like my money was really important to them, more important than giving me any specific info about the cavities even after I asked for specific info. The teeth dont hurt.\n\nDo all cavities need to be filled? Or can they just stay as a cavity and be left alone with proper routine dental care. JJ_8613: Hi.\n\nI'm sorry you're dealing with this.  I know from experience cavities are no fun.\n\nI agree with you that this office sounds very unprofessional.  You should always be able to get more information about your condition whether it be a cavity or something else.  I'm not sure if this is a dental low cost clinic or a private office that you went to, but often low cost clinics are like this.  That's been my experience.\n\nI'd call around to different offices to get pricing.  I'm not sure how long it'll be until you get insurance.\n\nDo not let the cavities go too long without treatment.  My dentist explained it to me this way.  A cavity is an active problem and if left alone it will worsen.  If you don't have pain now and you leave it untreated, you'll likely have pain later.\n\nI understand that cost can be difficult. In my experience the most a cavity filling has ever cost was $200 at a private office.  This may vary depending on the area.  You can also look into Care Credit.  This is a credit card exclusively for healthcare.  You can use it for doctors' visits, dental visits and pet health care.\n\nGood luck.\n\nJJ"

While working on the filling, my dentist had his mirror handle right on the inside of the upper lip.  He was trying to get a better look at the filling, but was pressing down hard enough with it on my upper lip that it was causing some serious pain.  It did get to the point I told him to stop, he apologized, and repositioned the mirror.  The rest of the procedure went smoothly.  I do not really remembering feeling pain in the lip after that.  I do remember walking out of the office and spitting out a small piece or 2 of the old fillings I missed while rinsing.\n\nA week later to the day I got a blister on the upper lip right where he was pressing down with the mirror handle.  \n\nThe blister is:\n\nInside the lip, not outside\n\nreddish-pink (close to the color of my lips)\nmaybe 1/4\" long and thin, appears across the lip not front to back \n\nno discernible border like a canker or cold sore  \n\nI do have a history of cold sores as a youth, but that was a *long* time ago!  It was painful for half a day then not painful at all.  I believe it filled with fluid, it was raised, but then reduced in size.  It looked like it was still there, or at least you could see where it was.  I did not feel it break or pop at all.  Then 2 days ago it was painful and raised again in the same spot!  Right now it feels fine, and I can maybe feel it raised a little.\n\nAt first I thought is was a cold sore of some type as I developed some sinus problems living in this great ever changing Midwest weather over this past weekend after the blister appeared.  One symptom I've never had with these before but have now is a case of dry mouth and white spots on my lips.  But, I went to sick call this morning, showed the blister to the physician's assistant doing sick call, and she didn't think is was a cold or canker sore either.  She did do a tongue scrape to see if I what's on my lips and tongue show signs of Candida.  I won't know the results for a few days.\n\nCould this blister be caused by trauma from the mirror handle?  If so, why would it take a week to appear?"

    "dialogue": "laurenkg123: Hello,\n\nI went in to have dental work done in July and when they were cleaning they noticed one of my teeth were fractured and it was a tooth that previously had a filling from when I was younger. The dentist decided to fill it with a crown. When he was filling it after being frozen I continued to feel pain. I ended up getting deep freezing about 5-6 needles one by my jaw until I couldnt feel the drilling. He assumed there was an infection so I was put on antibiotics. The same day as the crown was done I had to go on an airplane to fly for vacation. When I asked the dentist about flying he said it would be completely fine. I was frozen pretty much up until we loaded the plane and I was fine until we got in the air. As soon as the plane got off the ground I got an extremely sharp almost like a nerve pain directly in the socket of that tooth. It is a hard pain to describe, almost being shocked by an electric fence. I got 5-6 more shocks during the 3 hour flight and was in complete tears. When the plane landed I thought I was in the clear but the shocks continued for the next 3-4 days. When I pushed a grocery cart, when I was sleeping, when I chewed. I started the anitbiotics and the shocks seemed to go away. when I asked my dentist he said I probably needed my bite adjusted but I never got that done and the shocks went away. I assumed it was an infection but reading online I saw it could have been air in the tooth. I have to fly in 3 days and I am so scared to I am considering taking a train for 70 hours or a bus. I am hoping someone knows the answer to this. Is there medication I can take for this? Can I do something so this doesnt happen again? What was it from?"

    "title": "Unnerving Dentist; Root Canal",
    "dialogue": "AllCombinations: Hello. I have a question about the quality of my dentist.\n\nFirst of all, I neglected going to the dentist for about twelve or thirteen years between about 2002 and 2015 to the point of having multiple broken teeth and cavities. The exception within this span was in 2009 when I went in on account of a toothache which ended up requiring a root canal. The dentist was in my old town and his work was top notch.\n\nThen, this year, I signed up for Blue Cross Complete which has enabled me to seek dental care at no cost - the cost was what was always standing in my way. When I went in for my root canal in 2009 it cost me $1,000 and it took me a long time to pay for it. And it is my use of Blue Cross Complete that has, on the one hand, served to aid me in acquiring dental care, but that has also limited my options as most dentists, at least in my area, do not accept BCC. There are only two, or there were when I first signed up for BCC, and one of them had very poor reviews online, ergo I chose the other.\n\nMy dentist is quite different from the one I went to in 2009. This individual carries out what is clearly low quality work.\n\n\n  When I receive a filling they leave cement plastered all over my teeth - even teeth that did not receive treatment. Then, when I complain, they say that it will gradually fall off as I brush my teeth. But when I get home I find I cannot floss. So then I go back in and complain about it they forcibly floss through it so that the floss breaks through the cement and cuts my gums. Then they sit back and demand to be shown which teeth I cannot floss. I explained that I could have done that same thing myself but was afraid that flossing so hard would have possibly hurt my teeth. They say \"No! Flossing is ALWAYS good!\" as if what I said somehow amounted to \"I think flossing is harmful to my health\"\n  Usually, with so much cement on my teeth, my bite is very much \"off\" so that I cannot chew properly. When I complain about this there is sometimes a half-hearted attempt to fix the issue, but the dentist seems to get frustrated if the problem is not solved after the first few attempts. That is, if I complain that the problem is not fixed, after the 4th or 5th attempt on the part of the dentist, they start to look upset.\n  When working on the cavity of one tooth, they will begin to drill another tooth that has not received Novocaine. When I complain that it hurts they tell me to \"hold on\" and continue drilling. If I involuntarily jerk away they tell me not to move.\n  They chew gum while working on my teeth. Is that common?\n  When I was a kid and I received a shot of Novocaine, the dentist would go through this whole ceremony of aiming the giant needle at my gum before finally inserting the tip into the base of my tooth, or wherever the needle goes. This person neither aims nor is careful and the fluid from the needle sprays all around the inside of my mouth and even up all over my chin and nose. As they do this, they shrug and wiggle their eyebrows in that \"Who cares?\" kind of way you sometimes see people do.\n  When the dentist performs an x-ray (something they do almost every time I am there) they do not leave the room. Rather they put a sort of plate against whatever tooth it is that needs x-rayed, then tell an assistant to \"Go ahead\" and the x-ray is performed with the dentist still in the room. Isn't that bad for the dentist if they do that all day?\n\nThese are all things I have never seen before. Are a lot of dentists this way? I admit that some of these things, such as the x-rays, might just be things that have changed since I was a kid and don't really affect me; yet the whole big picture is that of a dentist who unnerves me.\n\nSo anyway... When I first came to this dentist, at least two of my teeth needed root canals. Then, after saying so, the dentist gave me a filling in place of one of the root canals without discussing it with me. But the other tooth was left alone. So a couple of weeks ago I went in for a root canal and received a temporary crown and was told to come back in three weeks from that date to receive a permanent crown. That three-week-from date would have been the 14th, this Monday. But on Labor Day Weekend my temporary crown broke and I needed to go back in. That was Wednesday the 9th. When I arrived they said that my permanent crown had arrived earlier than expected and so that was installed. I was told not to eat anything \"gooey or chewy\" for 24 hours, which I did not. Then yesterday I was eating a non-chewy/gooey meal 29 hours after my cap was installed and the cap broke, the inside part having snapped off. I could not find the broken piece so I assume I must have swallowed it on account of having not immediately realized that it had broken in the first place.\n\nNow, looking at the cap in a mirror, I can see a blackish color showing through from underneath. I assume this is some sort of metal though I do not claim to have a complete understanding of the structural design of dental caps.\n\nI have discussed this with my best friend and they think I should find a new dentist. However, the only other option under Blue Cross Complete is the one other dentist who had bad reviews and their office is not accepting new patients at this time anyway. I can break down and go to some other dentist but it will have to be for this botched root canal only and I will have to come back to this current dentist to receive the rest of my fillings.\n\nI have so many questions. Is this normal? Why did the cap break so quickly and easily? Should I keep going to this dentist or should I take my chances with some other dentist I know nothing about? In short, what do I do? I am completely at a loss as to how to move forward. I don't feel like I can correct the dentist. Do you instruct the bus driver on how to drive his bus? Short of \"stop drilling that, it hurts\" or \"my bite is off, please fix it,\" I don't know what else to say to this person. Are they slacking off because of the Blue Cross Complete I came in on? Does the fact that I am not rich affect the kind of treatment I get? Do they just not care?\n\nI welcome any help and/or advice. Thank you for your time in reading my rather long post. JJ_8613: Hi.\n\nI'm sorry that you've dealt with this.  I would definately see another dentist and not go back to this one, at all.  Call other offices up and tell them the situation.  Usually they'll work out a payment plan with you.  You can also look into Care Credit as a way to pay off the treatments.  I've used it before and you can usually get at least a year if not longer, interest free, to pay off the charges.\n\nI can't help in regards to the treatments and questions, but I don't like the sound of this dentist.  Please check out this forum http://www.dentalfearcentral.org/forum/ .  There are people on there that are more informed than I am that can assist with your questions.\n\nGood luck with everything.

I was afraid I would be told to just deal with it. I also do not like the sound of this dentist. They may have a phd but they are also poor at their art form (and people skills).\n\nThanks again!"

The bump is one tooth to the right of my canine and straight down, it's nearer to where the gum wall meets the mouth's floor than it is to the tooth. This protrusion is hard to recognize when feeling with fingers, yet, when feeling with my tongue it is quite recognizable and, there, the contrast between the bump on the right side and the symmetrically matching spot on the left side is like night and day as that matching spot on the left side is smooth.

Also said I needed insurance pre-approval and could be 5-7 business days. Ended up in ER for pain while waiting. Five days later I call back and am told to call insurance. Six days and I call insurance and they tell me that's not true, I don't need approval. They give me names of all oral surgeons in area. I call all of them and none can see me sooner than a month from now. I call dentist back and tell them. They tell me they have same names to give me. I ask for an emergency referral. I can't wait a month in so much pain. They said to come in on Saturday (4 days) and the dentist that comes in once a month and does extractions can look at it and see if he can do it. I go in and he said he can. It took him 17 tries to numb me. (40 minutes) He begins by sanding the tooth to flat with the gum??? And I still felt pain so he numbs it a few more times and leaves 20 minutes. He comes back WiTHOUT a hygienist. He holds the suction, drill, and other tool by himself. The suction chokes me several times. I choked on tooth fragments. My tongue kept falling back and stopping my breathting. This went on for 40 minutes. He finally gets frustrated and gets help. The hygienist has no clue when he asks for this tool or that so he keeps leaving to find tools in other rooms. Apparently he is frustrated the root on one side won't come out. My mouth on the one side is shredded. The hole is huge. I have blood pouring down my cheek. Numbness is wearing off. He then does something and said, \"I got it.\" He requests an xray. They say it's gone and send me to front desk. The receptionist said he is out of script paper so I will need to come back Monday to get scripts for antibiotic and pain help. 2 DAYS! ?? They gave me gauze. I was upset so they printed scripts on regular paper and said try a small pharmacy or like Wal-Mart or something because most won't take it without script paper. I tried- I was desperate. No one took it. I went to ER and got help. (Antibiotic and 8 Percocet) They were surprised as well. Went back on Monday because the pain was horrible. (12 Percocet) Thought dry socket or infection. Dentist that day (different one) said the xray taken Saturday showed root left inside and it would cause pain. She also said wait a month or so and it should come out or fuse into the bone. ?? I left sad/mad. Three more days and I cant handle the pain. I call every oral surgeon I find in directory- even if I am not covered...they say I need to be seen asap BUT none can get me in for minimum of 5 weeks. I take the one that can at least do xray and consult in ten days.I cannot even explain how bad it hurts. Its so bad I can't tell if it's causing me a headache. I get migraines and my head hurts but the mouth masks the pain in my head...and it's one of those headaches I worry will cripple me if I'm not careful. I end up back in the ER and they don't see infection so they send me home with Tylenol 3. I've been on Chlindomiacin since Monday. They don't see any exposed area so assume no dry socket. The next evening not even two Percocet took the pain away. (I have 6 left because I wasnt able to take them during the day. I have three kids and drive one to and from school.) Today I woke with a 2 large abscess. One almost covering the hole and one on the root surface of tooth behind it. The pain is just so unbearable and I have five more days for the OS appointment. Should I wait? Worry? Go back to ER? I'm losing my mind. I am NOT one who likes taking any pills. The antibiotic is making me have horrible acid reflux. I have hypothyroidism and that's been out of sorts for a year, I am suppose to have a hysterectomy in a month for several fibroids, I injured my rotary cuff three months ago, and those use to be my only worry. I don't even care about any of it right now. Should I be worried about osteomyelitis? I feel this dentist was incompetent and negligence is a factor.

    "title": "infection under crown - re- root canal?",
    "dialogue": "1964johnr: Just returned from my dentist with bad news. I need a root canal in a lower tooth at the back of the mouth, my dentist attempted the job, but told me it was to tricky for her and she will now refer me to an NHS Endodontist to see if they will do the treatment for me. So, that's a bit of a pain, but at least if the NHS can do it, it will not cost me a fortune. However, more of a problem is the tooth next to it which has a root canal and a crown. An xray showed a small area of infection immediately under the crown. My dentist explained that I would have to see a private endodontist to find out if the crown can be removed together with the infection, using a re- route canal treatment. Apparently I cannot get this done on the NHS because it has already had a root canal.She seemed to be of the opinion that it may or may not work because the crown may not be able to be removed without fracturing the tooth underneath. The cost could be anywhere from £800 to £1500. I am not a rich man, neither am I a poor man, but I am in a quandry as to what to do. I don't want to have both teeth extracted because that will badly affect my bite and eating. I will wait for my referral to the NHS endodontist and hope they can sort out the first mentioned tooth, but not sure what to do about the other one with the crown. What threw me a bit was when the dentist realised I was a little shocked at the price of a private endodontist ,she also said we could wait and xray the infected tooth under the crown in six months time. Why did she offer me this option ? Any views or help to make my decision would be appreciated. Dr Sapna Sharma: Hello,\nWhen did you had your root canal for the tooth with the crown? When you had root canal, what was the condition of your tooth before the therapy? \nNow do you have any pain or discomfort with this tooth? Any pus discharge?\nAnswer me these questions then I will tell you about it.\n\nAnd the second tooth which require root canal, you should proceed with the treatment without delay. 1964johnr: Dr Sapna Sharma said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHello,\nWhen did you had your root canal for the tooth with the crown?

Any pus discharge?\nAnswer me these questions then I will tell you about it.\n\nAnd the second tooth which require root canal, you should proceed with the treatment without delay.  \nThanks for replying. The root canal under the gold crown took place about eight years ago. I do not remember what condition the tooth was in. I have not had any pain from this tooth. It was only spotted by the dentist with an Xray which showed up a small black area of infection under the crown. She said the crown must be leaking.. I have not had any pain or swelling or discharge. If I had not had the Xray I would not know about it. Dr Sapna Sharma: Hello,\nIt surely indicates that the tooth has been infected again. So it would be needing re-root canal. But that too is unpredictable, there are 50% chances of its success. You should consult a good endodontist and then take the decision of its treatment. There is no need of extraction of that tooth till you have any symptoms of pain, swelling or pus.\nBut for the other tooth, you can proceed with the root canal. 1964johnr: Dr Sapna Sharma said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHello,\nIt surely indicates that the tooth has been infected again.

In an absolute nutshell, when MDMA is in the body, the magnesium attributed to muscle control and use is impacted, and this often causes people to clench their jaws.\n\nI experienced this, and what's happened is I suspect one of my teeth has become very slightly loose. When Iaggressively move my head from side to side, the tooth feels like it is squishing from side to side from the 'inside'.\n\nThe tooth is not painful to touch, nor has it become sensitive. It is only when I move my head around very quickly and aggressively that I feel a 'ping' of sensitivity on the tooth.\n\nWhen I press it, it makes a slight 'squish' sound against the gum.\n\nBasically, should I see a dentist, or is it okay to wait to see if the tooth solidifies against the gum in a few days? I don't particularly want to go to a dentist and tell them \"no, I don't have regular bruxism, don't worry\" as I will sound like a tit. To the same degree, I don't exactly want to tell them of drug use.\n\nAny help is much appreciated."

He did a few fillings and while he was on there said he saw a few more he thought were just starting and \"buffed them out with the drill real quick\" and did not follow up with any fillings or coatings of any sort in that area. When I took him back a few days ago, he had tons of cavaties in those same areas,  3 of which needed stainless steel caps. I'm pretty good about brushing his teeth so this was suprising to me,  I wonder is it normal to do that with a drill because it seems like it would remove all the enamel in those spots and start problems.  Also one of the caps fell off today, it looked like there was no adhesive of any sort put under there,  and it didn't fit right (wiggle around). The edges of the caps are really sharp,  and there are cuts on my child's lip.  He was in allot of pain through this whole process,  which I'm sure could be normal but he almost choked on a ton of fluid and gauze when he pretty much fell asleep in tears and exhaustion towards the end and they didn't notice.  I'm guess I'm really just trying to figure out if my dentist is a hack ripping off medicaid or if these are just the difficulties of pediatric/cosmetic dentistry.

I had the braces on for 7 months (extra month because they were too busy the last month to take them off.)\n\nI went back a couple days later for a cleaning after the removal. The dentist who had worked on the braces for the past seven months came in after the cleaning to buff away some residual cement found by the hygienist. I asked him when would the tenderness eventually subside. He didn't answer but continued working in my mouth. He finished and asked if it felt better. I bit down and it did feel a little better.

But when I came in, they had a hygienist explain why he had done i,t but couldn't offer a reason for not discussing it with me. Another dentist had to come in and polish them off so they weren't so rough. (They weren't going to do that unless I had said something?)\n\nFast forward to present, about 2 months later. My retainer was never re-done, so the mold is still from before the shaving. (I had expected them to make a new one but they did not. Although they did give me two extra retainers) My teeth are beginning to shift and look crooked slightly. (I wear my retainer every night and it does not feel tight) I suspect this is due to the fact there is extra space on top, allowing the teeth to move.\nI have moved out of state...which makes this complicated... but I would like to write the dentist a letter expressing my complete dissatisfaction and requesting a refund.

    "dialogue": "AptPupil: I went to the dentist to get a wisdom tooth extracted. I was completely horizontal, growing forward with the roots curved down at the back. I’m 48 years old & know I should have had this done years ago, but hindsight… The dentist used Novocaine, 2-3 doses to start. She then cut the crown loose & pulled it out. More Novocaine. Tried & tried to get the neck & roots out. More Novocaine. Ground, drilled. More Novocaine. Drilled, broke, pried, pulled. Lots more Novocaine. Etc. I was in the chair for 5 hours with a bite-block (2 or 3 5-10 minute breaks or Novocaine to take effect). The last break was after the last set of injections. I sat up just to change positions for a minute. I looked at the instrument table, and counted the veils/cartridges of Novocaine over & over (as a distraction). There where 16 of them! What is the maximum dosage??\nThe last 45 min.s to an hour was bad. I could feel every pry, twist, and pull. When I left, I was is some pretty bad pain. My jaw hurt like it was dislocated. But, the worst part, I think, was the fact that she didn’t get the roots out!! Basically, everything under/passed the neck is still there!!! I snapped a picture of my x-ray last week. I wish I could include it in this post. My nerve is clearly visible, as well, and can be seen running right through that area. Beside the roots or possibly twisted between them from all the attempts?? For three weeks I had a pretty intense cramping from almost the top of my head to just above my collarbone. The doctor has prescribed pain medication and antibiotics since day one and last week, added a muscle relaxer, which seems to have REDUCED the cramping, but I’m still in a lot of pain. It doesn’t feel like extraction pain, nor does it feel like infection pain. And, while there is pain in the gland area & running straight across just above my adams apple, my glands aren’t swollen.\nThis was done by a dentist at the urgent dental care facility (due to financial woes, I received assistance) in my town, not an oral surgeon.\nCan you give any insight into why so much pain? Could there be serious damage? Have you ever left an entire root or two in a patient & told them that over time, maybe a year or more, they would loosen on their own & would be easily removable once they worked their way up a bit??? I have an upper partial plate that I have not been able to keep in for more than 5-10 minutes, because it starts cramping in my jaw which then spreads. I’m a salesman, but not without my front teeth in!!! What should I do???\n\nAt a loss & going crazy from a month of pain,\nJeff Zuri Barniv: I am only hearing your version of the story, but if there are root pieces still left after 5 hours of work and you are in that much pain, with swelling spreading towards your neck area...this really needs to be addressed by someone competent and pronto. The dentist or someone in the office needs to see you and deal with this problem. Leaving exposed roots and saying they will one day rot out of your mouth would be laughable if it wasn't so serious. Send us the x-ray if you can. If nothing else, you could look up and call the local Dental Society and explain your situation, They may be able to send you to an oral surgeon for a reduced rate to solve this.\n\nOne other important point: Discounted dental work does not excuse a dentist to practice below the Standard of Care. You have a right to receive competent care regardless of what you paid for the procedure.\nDr. Barniv AptPupil: Thank you for the response & advice. I think I figured out how to post my x-ray.\n\n\n\n\nThose aren't little chips! A month later (today) & I feel, ever so slightly, better.\nI talked to her (DDS) yesterday & she said she is going to refer me to an oral surgeon, but it won't be until, at least, Tuesday. This dental urgent care is only open on Tuesdays & the financial person is on vacation until then. I don't have the money to pay upfront for an oral surgeon, otherwise, I'd have gone there in the first place. Should I go to the emergency room? The thing about the hospital here is they seem to think everyone that walks in the door is there just to get pills. Maybe if I go in with my own Rx in hand they will see that I'm not there for pills, but actually need help. But, I can hear them now, \"We can't do anything for you. You'll have to see an OS.\" Then, I'll just have a bill to show for my visit.\n\nOh woe is me,\nJeff AptPupil: BTW, this tooth only had two roots. AptPupil: And, what is the maximum amount of novocaine? Zuri Barniv: Dentists haven't really used Novocaine for decades, it has just become a cultural norm to call dental shots \"novocaine\". Most all modern dentists use Lidocaine with a little epinephrine (adrenaline) in them. The maximum dose of Lidocaine is dependent on your weight as well as how the shots were given (in the muscle, under the skin, etc) and over how much time. Bottom line: If you are happily writing on this forum weeks after the procedure, you did not receive an overdose of anesthesia. Focus on the roots left in your jaw as the primary issue that needs to be resolved. AptPupil: Okay, noted. What are your thoughts on the x-ray? Have you ever seen that much material left behind? Zuri Barniv: Sure I have, and they need to be removed by a competent oral surgeon. If you leave them and they get infected, it could ultimately affect the jaw nerve running right next to those roots causing you numbness or pain in you lip and chin. There are other even worse things that could result from this, and they are much more likely to happen than the other possibility of the roots finding their way out of your jaw naturally over time. Actually, it would be more likely that the roots would get encased by new jaw bone and essentially get entombed. This would be the best thing that could happen, but it's really hard to predict whether that will or won't. Bottom line: go see an oral surgeon...please. AptPupil: Thank you very much for all the info & advice. After talking to the dentist yesterday, she told me that she will talk to the financial person & tell her that I need to see an oral surgeon & that it should be covered, She seems to be sincerely concerned about the situation, which makes me feel better. I just have to wait until Tuesday. Wish me luck, and I'll keep you posted\n\nJeff"

Fast forward to last Saturday, July 25th, and I was having not excruciating pain, but some sensitivity.\n\nI made a dentist appointment, and saw the dentist. They brought me into the back and took X-Rays, came back about 20 minutes later, and said that everything looks fine. There was no discoloration, everything looked normal from the outside as well. The dentist said, the only thing she could think that could be causing pain is a cracked root. She then recommended me to an Endodontist for an evaluation. Before I left, they prescribed me Penicillin & Vicodin.\n\nI then called the Endodontist, to make an appointment and the lady said she would call me back with a time, date and price. When I got a call back, she told me that it would be the next day, although the price would be $1,101. She also stated that she called my insurance, Humana One, and said that they will not cover the procedure because it hasn't been a 24 month period yet for the same tooth. I didn't know what to do besides put my appointment on hold and find a way to get the money. \n\nI then thought, why would an evaluation cost more than a grand. So, I called the place back and questioned them about it and they said the price was for the procedure. My question was, how could you schedule a procedure, when we are unsure of what the problem is. So, we then set up an evaluation and found that I have 3-4 abscesses on the roots I got the root canal on. Now, I am curious to find out, is it possible for the roots to get infected after a root canal?\n\nI asked the Endodontist if the Penicillin would heal the infection, which it was making it feel a lot better, and the swelling even went down. He said that it wouldn't help because there are no blood vessels going to that area to carry the Penicillin. I felt kind of suspicious about that, because wouldn't it have to travel to that area to make it feel better? Anyways, he said that he would have to drill above the cap and inject antibiotics to heal the abscesses. And that the procedure would be the $1,101.\n\nMy questions here are:\n\nCould this be a cause of a root canal not done properly?\nIf it is, what should I do, and how do I prove it?\nAs of right now, after taking the Penicillin and not for a day, my mouth feels great and normal. Should I not get the procedure done?\nAnd, does it sound like they are trying to ream me of money? LOL.\n\nAny help will do, I just feel like I don't need this done, although once again, I am no Dentist. Thanks."

    "dialogue": "NotSoWiseTeeth: Hi, my name is Rick and I've had this problem for about 4 years now. When I initially went in to have my wisdom teeth checked out, my dentist told me that I could keep all but one of them and then proceeded to cut out my lower right wisdom tooth that day, my experience was fine and I didn't have any of the symptoms of extreme pain that people say they have afterwards, just achy for a few hours after the surgery, until I popped the medication he gave me. Well he told me that there would be no problem with my keeping the rest of my wisdom teeth and even put a filling in one of them, so I figured it's fine to just ignore them, aside from regular brushing and flossing. Well about a year after that surgery I went to the movies with my girlfriend at the time and when I tried to get some popcorn from between my back molar and wisdom tooth, I took my finger out of my mouth only to discover a big chunk of white had decided to hitch a ride with the kernel, I didn't think much of it, I thought it might have just been a piece of popcorn, it wasn't until later that I discovered that the chunk of white was actually a piece of my wisdom tooth. Since I'm really afraid of the dentist, due to a bad experience as a child, I decided not to have it taken care of.\n\nFast forward 4 years, now I'm single and that wisdom tooth has a pretty sizable chunk missing from it and it's black where that chunk is missing, I've never experienced any pain unless something touches it, but recently it's been a tad bit sore... My issue is that I have this thing about teeth, I don't want a dentist to poke it and prod it, I just want it to be taken out, I know it's going to shatter when they try to grip it and that makes me cringe like nothing else in this world... So my question is essentially this... Can I just go to the dentist, tell them that I know what's up with my \"not-so-wise tooth\" as I like to call it, ask them to refer me to an oral surgeon without them poking at my teeth and then tell the surgeon that I just want them to knock me out, cut the tooth out and let that be the end of it? I really don't want to be awake for this, I just want to go to sleep and wake up with it gone and move about my life as normal, can I do that?\n\nOh and bonus points if I get to keep the tooth, make a necklace out of it and my other one so I can tell people that they're the teeth of my underlings who undergo a very painful ritual in order to worship me."

My two front teeth at the top (incisors) have always been pretty healthy, and according to my dentist last time I saw him, look pretty good. However, when I bite down, and the front teeth touch the bottom teeth, they move ever so slightly forward, and I can also move them ever so slightly forward with my tongue. There is no discomfort or pain, and I can only feel the movement at the very bottom of the teeth, and that only if I REALLY look for it.\n\n\nIs this normal, or should I immediately run to my dentist? GravyDavey: Mine do the same, but backwards into my mouth. it's a very very slight move, but I can feel it nonetheless.

Only now I've lived in the city for a few months have I realized the social norm is to brush my teeth. Is it too late to start brushing now or could I damamge my teeth? I've never been to a dentist before but my teeth seem healthy enough. Dentgr: You can start brushing now but I would strongly suggest to visit a dentist asap to check your oral health. You ll probably need some periodontal treatment and hopefully nothing more. Ask your dentist to give you information on the right way of teeth brushing and flossing.\nYou can't turn back time so it's never too late! Cygre: Hey Barry! Short answer is no, it's not too late! Get a soft bristled brush and some good toothpaste and you're ready to go. Twice a day--Once in the morning after you wake up, and once more before you hit the hay. You'd only damage your teeth if you brush with too much force. Once you're comfortable, get into flossing! Toothbrushing + flossing is the way to go \n\nStill, a thorough dental screening wouldn't hurt. Many diseases or problems in the mouth are often misdiagnosed or overlooked outside the clinical setting, and what you'd consider healthy may not be so to a dentist. Barry: I tried brushing my teeth today with a brush and toothpaste I bought at the supermarket and when I finished there was blood everywhere? Is this normal or should I be concerned? Cygre: That's something that happens to most people when they brush their teeth, and blood + saliva will look like there's more blood than there really is.\n\nSo it is normal from your description. Keep brushing for the week. If the bleeding is still a lot, a dentist should look into it! Also, do you see some hard, yellowish stuff behind your front-most lower teeth? That'd be calculus. Those things can only be removed by scaling at the dentist's.\n\n(You might be interested in proper brushing technique as well! It'll ensure you're thoroughly removing plaque and not damaging your teeth.)"

I'm also a diabetic and just did a stick test to see how quickly my blood will clot, and it did right away. Am I over-worrying here? Also, I heard using  tea bag will help stop the bleeding - is there a certain way to do this?Thanks! Cygre: This response is many hours late, but I hope I'll be able to help somehow. Extractions are usually only done on well-controlled diabetics, so it shouldn't affect your wound healing too much.\n\nComplete cessation of bleeding may take a while. Even tomorrow you might see some blood still oozing out from the wound. Keep in mind that when blood mixes with saliva, it might look like there's more blood than there really is. Don't bite too hard on the gauze, too, and make sure the gauze is a bit moist. Otherwise it'd pull out blood clots along with it.\n\nYup, tea bags can help! Bite on it as you would a gauze, and for half an hour. (Tea bags contain tannic acid, which constricts blood vessels, so make sure it touches the wound, not just hanging above it!)\n\nif the oozing exceeds a day or if the bleeding is bright red, contact the surgeon.

Just saw them in January and they said my teeth looked great. I floss every day and brush my teeth twice a day.\n\nThe past couple of weeks I've been unable to chew on my right side because of sensitivity in my teeth. I thought maybe I had chipped a tooth or something. I haven't been able to go see a dentist because I'm away at school and don't drive so I have no way of getting to one. Now today, I was examining my molars and I realized that I have  a small brown dot on my second to last bottom right molar. It is right on the edge of a filling on the top of the tooth I have had done in the past. On my last molar on the front of the tooth, I have a large black line that runs around the edges of a previous filling. Also on the last molar there is a tiny black dot on the front of the tooth, but it's not anywhere near a previous filling.\n\nDo these sound like cavities? They look like cavities to me, but why would I suddenly have developed cavities in such a short period of time, as an adult?? It's only been four months since I was at the dentist, and I haven't introduced more sugar into my diet or anything. In fact, for a month and a half of those four months, I cut out candy completely. \n\nI'm going home in two weeks, should I wait until then to see my regular dentist, or make an appointment with a dental student for this week? I'm afraid if I keep waiting it will turn into something more serious. Zuri Barniv: Hayley, in most people, cavities take about 2-3 years to develop. It takes many more years to develop into something serious. It is very unlikely you are looking at real cavities and much more likely they are stains forming in pitted areas. If it has been a while since your last cleaning, that could also explain it. If your dentist told you a few months ago you were fine, the chance these are real cavities is close to zero. Wait to see your regular dentist when you get home. jonny_r: It's too short period of time for the cavity to be developed, so you don't have to worry. Just wait for the next visit to the dentist. \nThink not only about candies, but also about other changes in a diet, that could cause the stains. Nimita: I do not think they are cavities. Until you see your dentist you should do oil pulling. It's a technique where you swish oil (coconut oil preferably) in your mouth until it turns white. The reason being it not only helps in making your teeth whiter but also in removing bacteria."

It's important to remember that every treatment, including a repair, carries risk. And there is a risk that trying to fix these teeth will actually lead to their premature demise. That needs to be discussed with you in additional to the potential benefits. I am not saying you should not have these teeth fixed, but leaving them alone is also a valid treatment option that you need to look into.

MarkSummers: Since you are getting stress with all of that, I would rather do a second option if you are open with that. Because different dentist have different set of ideas."

Dentgr: I would suggest you to remove them due to their inclination towards the second molars. This may cause problems in the future. Go for it now as it will be much easier for you because they still lack their roots. Zuri Barniv: I would hold off on removing these for two reasons:\n1. The roots have not fully formed and it is hard to remove teeth that don't have any roots yet (from a surgical standpoint, it is much less challenging when roots have partially formed)\n2. The teeth may still upright as your jaw grows. Just a rough estimate tells me you are about 17 years old and your jaw is still growing and more room is being created.\n\nDr. Barniv"

    "dialogue": "AndyAl: While living in Tulsa, OK, a few years ago, I visited a dentist who filled a few root canals and placed a dental cap on one of my teeth. After I moved to Boston, MA more than two years ago, I began noticing unusual body reactions (I refer to them as unusual because I am a very healthy male person in my 40s, who had not experienced something like this before and, throughout my life time, treated by dentists only) related to that dental work, such as:\n- mechanical vibrations in the area of a tooth cap (the cap and tooth themselves sit very firm, but when such mechanical vibrations occur, it feels like there is something inside the tooth, like a tiny electrical/electronic device, which causes the vibrations);\n- deeply cutting tongue with teeth while eating resulting in bleeding, strong pain, and headaches (as if \"something\" continue holding the tongue between teeth when jaws are closing instead of letting it return to its normal position); unusual pricking in the heart and prostate when I read something very familiar or related to my bio on electronic devices (pc, cell phone, etc.); unusual spasms in the head area happening when I talk to certain people and resulting in headaches afterwards (and felt like \"controlled\" headaches, because they stop as unpredictably as they begin); and hands and legs jerking (as if I am hit by electric current), which especially dangerous when happen during road crossings and cause to stumble;\n- subcutaneous contractions in the areas of face (corners of mouth and eyes, cheeks, etc.), fingers, limbs - again, when I read something very familiar or related to my bio on electronic devices.\nI think the dentist inserted something inside the teeth, and that device now causes the described body reactions. Another ugliest part of the issue is that, when I visited about 10 dental clinics in Boston, MA for the period of two years while it is going on (including the clinic at Harvard university and the clinic of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital), their dentists pretended they had never met anybody with the similar issue before, as if I were their first visitor with such complaint, gave vague responses or declined to answer some questions at all, and could not, from their words, precisely identify the source of the problem.\nI decided to begin with getting the dental cap removed.

I developed hyper sensitivity allergies to things and became scared to do the things needed for my health.  Shortly after a bottom molar cracked in half.  I've literally lived with it for almost 20 years, never seeing the dentist and chewing on one side.  I almost had it worked on, but didn't.  Terrible decision.  \n\nAbout 2 years ago my top wisdom tooth on the other side broke in half.  I lived with that as it didn't cause much pain.  About 4 months ago while eating the majority of the wisdom tooth fell out.  I can feel just a tip of the outer part of the tooth in a few spots.  At first it was a bit hole and how I can feel skin in the middle of the hole (not sure if it's a swollen nerve or what.  It didn't hurt for the first month, but I've had some pain recently.   \n\nTo make things much worse, I have a heart valve issue and overall am not in great shape.  \n\nAt this point I've got myself into a position that I don't know how to get out of.  I always sort of thought I could have the tooth(s) extracted if needed, but with the wisdom tooth now below the gum I'm guessing it's now major surgery.  \nI'm in such bad mental shape it literally feels like I can either struggle along as is until a complication kills me or risk my life by dealing with the dentist/surgery.   \n\nOverall thoughts/worries:\n\nSo much wrong with my mouth, where would they start?\nFear I couldn't survive going completely under anesthesia instead of a local, but pretty sure they'll need to put me under for the wisdom tooth issue\nNo idea how they'll get my cracked wisdom tooth out\nCan't imagine dealing with my heart issue though surgery (if that's needed) before handling my teeth, BUT I can't imagine doing he reverse either\nSorry for the long post.  I know there's not an easy answer, but would appreciate some input.  \n\nAnd if nothing else this might be a great lesson for those putting stuff off.  If only I had gone years ago.\n\nThe amount of trouble I've gone through to get around the dentist is unbelievable vs just going 18 years ago.  So dumb.\n\nOh boy... AestheticDentistry: Larry said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tea how they'll get my cracked wisdom tooth out I would suggest that you research dental experts in your area. A professional will be knowledgeable about what to do for the condition of your wisdom teeth. Removing wisdom teeth is possible, cracked or not, and it does take some recovery time.\n\nIf you do not receive treatment for these teeth, it could lead to further infections that will cause you some pain, and it may be contributing to the pain you are experiencing now.\n\nAs for your heart condition, there are a variety of sedation methods that aren't as serious as full anesthesia. For example, laughing gas is used in most wisdom tooth removal procedures. IV sedation and conscious sedation are other methods that may work for you."

    "dialogue": "lithn: Around two months ago I went to the dentist because a tooth (back bottom molar) had started to become sensitive to hot and cold. The dentist did an x-ray, examined it and could not see a reason for the sensitivity but decided to replace an old amalgam filling (approx 10 years) just in case this was the culprit. Shortly after this, my tooth started to hurt to bite down on, progressively over a few days becoming very severe and the tooth behind it was just as painful to touch.\n\nI went back to the dentist who replaced the filling and they couldn't see a problem with the tooth (no x-ray done) and decided to go to another dentist for a second opinion. This dentist noted that there was a little bit of inflammation visible on the x-ray, but that didn't explain how severe the pain was and the fact that the tooth behind was very sore as well. This dentist recommended root canal or extraction.\n\nThis pain subsided after about 3 weeks, however the tooth still didn't feel quite right (not sure how to explain the feeling, significantly less pain though).\n\nFast forward to now ---\n\nThe last few days I have had the severe toothache return in the same teeth, worsening to the point where I cannot sleep, eat or barely function. The tooth is not particularly sensitive to hot/cold but is extremely painful to touch (even with a toothbrush softly). I went to my regular dentist this morning, who did an x-ray and told me that both of my back teeth are dying, but that she cant see a reason why that would be happening. The x-ray showed significant inflammation under the root (ligament? uncertain of the terms/names she used sorry), but no pulp was exposed/no deep filling and no mention of an abscess.\n\nHer recommendation was that I get root canal of both teeth done ASAP.\n\nNow my question is, will this necessarily be solved by root canal? Reason for asking is that this dentist and the other ones I saw previously couldn't understand why I had such significant pain and why the teeth are dying at all.\n\nHas anyone else had anything similar happen?\n\nJust as a side note, I have Behcet's Disease (not sure if that is useful info). drmins: Kindly upload your recent x-ray images."

During one of the appointments my dentist applied anesthetic with a syringe somewhere in the back of my mouth and she hit so painfully (probably right into the nerve), that the right side of my jaw got immediately numb and it was very unpleasant like an electric shock reaching the first tooth on the same side. Anyways, after 5 -6 hours the anaesthtic wore off my tongue, but for a week I was experiencing a strange feeling of numbness (especially when opening my jaw) in the front lower tooth. But then it passed. \n\nUnfortunately a few days ago (3 months after the treatment!) the feeling surprisingly came back! I didn't hurt my teeth or anything and again I get the feeling of pressure/ numbness in my front lower tooth on the same side when I open my jaw to eat or talk. \n\nI'd like to add the on the same side of my mouth in the lower arch I \"keep\" an impacted wisdom tooth. It grows horizontally, but its crown is directed towards the other molars, so it's unlikely to damage the nerve. So what can be the cause of the strange neurological feeling in my tooth coming back suddenly??\n\nAnd the important thing is that the feeling I experience is not pain!

    "dialogue": "manaus: Hello everyone!\n\nRecently, I changed dentists (my regular doctor is very ill).  My new dentist said I have plaque under the gum line.  He couldn't believe I had my last regular cleaning only 4 months ago and said I needed a \"deep cleaning\" (root planing and scaling).  \n\nBy the way, I brush my teeth at least 3 times a day, floss daily, and my gums aren't bleeding. I've been having a regular cleaning every 3-4 months with my old dentist since I was diagnosed with beginning gum disease. \n\nMy old dentist did some type of procedure, probably \"flap surgery\" when he diagnosed me with gum disease.  That was about 16 years ago.  After the surgery, my teeth looked longer.\n\n1. Will the deep cleaning that my new dentist recommended make my teeth look even longer? \n2. What's the difference between the procedure that my old dentist did and a deep cleaning (root planing and scaling)? KarenP.: I am not a dentist.  However, the deep cleaning should not make your teeth look longer unless you have significant gum disease.  The reason why I think this is because your gums could be swollen because of the tartar and plaque under the gumline.  Once this stuff is removed, your gums could recede because they are healing.  I myself have \"long\" teeth, but I have accepted this as the result of many years of poor dental hygiene.\n\nWhat you should be also considering is the size of the periodontal pockets along your gums.  I don't think patients really think about the size as that important.  However, the size of the pockets do provide an indication of whether or not your gum health is getting better, worse, or stablizing.  If you are cognizant of the numbers, then at least you know whether or not you are attaining your goal of healthy gums, or for that matter, stablizing your condition.\n\nBecause I abhor dental surgery of any kind, I feel that there is a huge difference between gum flap surgery and a deep cleaning.  Deep cleaning is much less invasive.  You apparently have accumulated plaque down below the gum line and your new dentist will have to give you a needle while he scoops out the calcified plaque.  I suspect that your previous dentist cut a flap in your gums, so that he could access the same plaque.\n\nI am surprised that despite the excellent oral hygiene that you have been undertaking all these years that you need a deep cleaning.  This is truly unfortunate that your efforts have not been rewarded with perfectly healthy gums.  Maybe I am right, maybe I am wrong.  I am beginning to believe that only the patient with the assistance of his/her dentist can achieve true dental health.  A dentist has over 700 patients ... how can he/she remember and provide good advice to each and every patient.  (For example, I myself have a genetic predisposition to abnormally higher amounts of plaque.  And I feel that this has never been adequately addressed by any of my dentists).  On the other hand, no matter how hard a dentist works to help his/her patients, there is no guarantee that the patient will understand and follow the dentist's instructions.\n\nBest of luck.  I hope that your new dentist works out for you."

KarenP.: Sorry, but had to answer the door and I attempted to remove my post which is above.\n\nYour \"boil\" could be the result of several things: brushing too diligently, and not gently enough.  Maybe there is something underneath the gum that may cause so irritation.  Maybe you introduced something into your mouth that may have irritated your gums.  For example, I started gargling with Crest mouth wash and white guk continually formed inside my mouth ... along with a boil.\n\nMaybe you should relax a bit and it could go away.  Since you have had it for 3 weeks now, maybe you should consider what you have been doing in the past 3 weeks which you didn't do before.  But I would not wait too long before seeing a dentist.\n\nI am not a dentist, but it doesn't sound too serious if you have no pain.

Anyone have a tip or know of a tool that can take off a bit of the nonchipped corner of my tooth?\n\nRegards\nKasper\n\nBtw sorry for my bad english its not my native langauge >.< KarenP.: I had the same thing ... but not from hockey.  The jagged edge of the tooth was continuallly rubbing against my tongue.  It wasn't particularly comfortable.  I've had different dentists.  One became ill ... started with another one and was not too pleased.  Both suggested \"filing it down\".  Finally, I went to a periodontist and a newly-graduated dentist who was working in the same office as the periodontist, suggested to build up/restore the tooth to its original.  She also indicated that it is possible that if I habitually grind my teeth and any addition to the tooth could fall off.  I would know this in two months' time. \n\nI thought I would take the chance.  So far everything has been o.k.  It's been over a month and a half now.  My tongue is no longer bothered by the tooth.\n\nIn your case, I think it may depend on how much of the tooth is remaining.  In my situation, the \"chip\" was at the corner of one of my front lowers.  My lower fronts were far from straight to begin with (i.e. they overlap).\n\nIt really did not cost me too much to get this fixed.  The newly-graduated dentist charged me $125.  But I find that her rates were much lower than the more experienced dentists in the office.  If you can't find an inexpensive dentist, maybe try one of the dental schools.\n\nHope that this helps you somewhat."

I knew I needed to go for some time, but on Sunday part of my back molar chipped off so I booked to go.\nUpon arrival I had to complete medical history form; on it I clearly stated that I suffer from Sulfite allergy and I cant have dental block that contains sulfite preservative.\n\nI went into the Doctors chair and he had a really brief look at the tooth in question and said \"ok we'll get it filled, let me numb you up\" So I stopped him there and said did you see about my allergy on the form? At which point he picked up the form that the receptionist had left on the side and ummmed and ahhed a bit and asked me the actual name of what I was allergic to. I said there was lots of different names for Sulfite preservative and that I didnt know them all, but that they all had the word sulfite in them somewhere. He told me he would have to look into it.\nOk so I said, will I be getting a check up today, xrays etc...? \"oh ok\" he replied and proceeded to give my teeth a more thorough examination and xrays, plus he put some temp filling product on my tooth until I have actual treatment.\n\nAfter that was done I popped out of the room while he had to price all the treatment up and I got called back after about 5 mins.\n\nHe then said I would need another lots of xrays next time I was there to check  my root is ok for the molar that is chipped and he is planning on filling- if its not ok it may need root canal or extraction he also advised another few fillings needed to be done. \n\nI have 3 main issues from my visit......\n\n1.) Why was he ready to fill the tooth when I first sat down without even really looking at it... and then he is now saying that it may need root canal or extraction and another set of xrays next time, even though I only had xrays today that he looked at? Are there different xrays for teeth and roots?\n\n2.) Advising I need a few fillings is fine, but I have a BIG cavity in my other back molar I can feel with my tongue- he didnt even pick up on it or advise it needs anything doing to it!?\n\n3.) I'm very concerned that he didnt even bother to look at my medical form that clearly stated I had a sulfite allergy. And when I did point it out he seem totally baffled and stumped by it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts guys, am I overracting that I am now nervous about going  back? Your comments are appreciated.

I had 3 fillings done on the bottom right side of my mouth. Once the numbing wore off, I could feel how sharp and uneven the fillings were. I was going back to the dentist for other work so when I went back the following week, I told the root canal specialist that I was having issues and he went to get the dentist. She refused to see me even though she was available. The root canal specialist tried to smooth them out for me and sent me home. The next few days the pain became unbearable, my tongue was all cut up on the side from the jagged fillings and I now had a giant sore right below the fillings. I'm to the point where I can't touch the outside of my face, touch the inside of my jaw along the gum line without severe pain or floss those teeth. I made an appointment with the dentist that did the fillings and when she saw me she said there would be no reason I was in pain and refused to look in my mouth! I walked out in tears and when I turned around to practically beg her for help she closed the door on me and then refused to speak to me. It's now been 2 more weeks and the pain is going into my ear. I've had fillings done before back when I had insurance and I never had any issues like this. I am trying to find another office but in the meantime I'm super worried that something serious is going on. Currently I am still in constant severe, throbbing and stabbing pain. I still have the giant sore under the teeth, I can't touch inside my mouth along my jaw line or the outside of my face, the fillings are still super jagged and cutting up my tongue pretty bad and if I try to floss it's extremely painful and achy with the one tooth and the other feels like an open cavity still.

Healing depends on a lot of factors,but usually occurs in first two weeks,depending on the level of trauma. As your dentist has given you an opinion that there are no signs of infection or dry socket, stay calm. Maintain good oral hygiene, saline gargle (if there is no restriction for you about salt) and have good vitamins and anti-oxidant rich diet. You will be alright soon."

I went to the dentist yesterday to have just a general checkup, I've thought my wisdom tooth may be infected for a few weeks now as I had a horrible taste in my mouth sometimes and it didn't feel quite right, so I mentioned it to my dentist yesterday and he took a look and said that he thinks I may have a slight infection and so long as it isn't causing me pain we'll leave it for now and see if it just grows out and he recommended that I should brush well and maybe after lunch too and use mouthwash to prevent any food and stuff getting in there.\n\nBut I woke up this morning and I could feel some pressure so I squeezed my gum and some hard kind out grey/brown pus came out and I also get liquidy pus come out from the gum all round my wisdom tooth. I'm sure my dentist knows what he is talking about but should I go back and ask for some antibiotics or should I just ride it out? I just don't want to create any problems or any lasting damage for myself!\n\nThanks guys, Tash drmins: Your dentist was following a conservative approach in treatment and was trying to heal the inflamed flap of operculum (the loose kind of gum you were talking about). \nConstant food lodgement and poor oral hygiene can cause this flap of gum to get infected and the tooth to get decayed. Only if recurrent infections occur or good amount of food lodgement is observed,excision of this flap is needed. Else,the conservative approach is sufficient.\n\nIts recommended to use antibiotics and get a localised scaling done. Warm saline gargle is very effective in cases like these.\n\nKeep smiling. John Roger: If your dentist said leave it for now, i don't think that was a correct approach. Dental problem should not be left untreated and must be immediately take care of.  Infected wisdom tooth might also cause sore throats. I would also suggest  Warm saline gargle Tash: Thank you for both your replies. I woke up this morning and there was a lot more oozing coming from my wisdom tooth area and a bigger lump came out but I didn't have to squeeze it, its pretty gross when I think about it \n\nI've been using mouthwash to gargle with after every brush but I'll start using a warm gargle after I've eaten too.\n\nThanks!"

    "dialogue": "CIANOD: When I was younger, about 11/12, I went to the dentist for the first time in years and got a couple of fillings and other work done. Should've gotten braces, unsurprisingly at that age I was reluctant.\n\nI went about my life normally for most of the next ten years, eating and drinking what I want without a visit to the dentist. I still feel like any childhood dentist should keep in contact with you, which she didn't, and parents should encourage you to go, which they didn't, but at the end of the day I was a teenager and going to dentist should probably be a responsibility you should take on yourself.\n\nDrinking stuff like vodka as a teenager, I always woke up the following day with pains in the corner of my mouth but I generally ignored it thinking it would blow over in a day or two. \n\nA few months before I turned 21, my Mam and Dad started saying to me that my bottom teeth were a bit crooked and stained and said I should go to the dentist, so I went to my Dad's dentist. He said a lot of the enamel had gone off my teeth among other problems and booked me in for an appointment with the orthodontist across the road.\n\nI went there and he said pretty much the same thing, and here's where I think things got lost in translation between us. What I think he said was, and what he actually might of said, we'll check back in a year. I think that either meant we'll see what the progress is like in a year and work towards fixing them, or call back in a year and we'll see. Because over three years later, the man still hasn't called me back.\n\nSince then, especially over the last two years (since the year passed), I've become so self-conscious and anti-social over the whole situation. Love-life, non-existent over the last two years. \n\nI'm afraid to go back now, because I'm not sure what the options are. The questions I have about it are, 1. How long will it take, 2. How much will it cost?, 3. What are they actually going to do?, 4. What will I look like during it? 5. What will I look like after it? At 24, I'm surely too young for a full set of false teeth and I certainly don't want to be walking around with a full set of pristine, fake-looking, false teeth that don't fit in my mouth.\n\nAnyone have any experience with stuff like this, or is anyone a dental expert. drmins: First concern is about the amount of demineralisation or decay  that has occured on your teeth. Having treated that, you can get an orthodontic correction of your irregularly arranged teeth.\n\nIn both the phases, you can have pretty good options offered by the dentists. \nPhase 1: if the situation demands a crown or veneer, you can have \"near to natural\" looking crowns and veneers that cannot be distinguised by others.\nPhase 2: Even in orthodontic treatments, there are ceramic or transparent brackets which help you to avoid others from noticing them much. If you want to go still advanced, you can have removable aligners to treat your crooked tooth.\n\nSo worry not. Fix your appointment with your dentist soon. Keep smiling."

Get your x-ray image done to confirm the extend of caries. The treatment of choice will be root canal,followed by a crown.\n(Its a misconcept that root canal being a little expensive,can be replaced with some other inexpensive fillings. Root canal treatments are indicated only when your tooth's pulp get infected. And in such cases,root canal treatments or extractions are the only options available.On an average, root canal treatment in India costs as low as 40-50 USD only) Dentgr: This tooth may be  unrestorable.... Sorry but I think it's gonna be extracted. drmins: Based on an x-ray image, possibilities of having a post and core restoration and then a crown, can be thought of. aindriu80: Hi,  Thanks for the replies ! I sent the dentist the above picture and they made a appointment on the 13th of March for an X-Ray and an examination.  They couldn't tell what I would need to get done based on the picture.\n\nThere is almost exactly 1/2 the tooth left now and its still bright white (i don't know if you can tell in the above) so I guess that means its kinda rotten and I will probably have to get it removed.

Last week my dentist told me that molar's root was infected and couldn't be saved.  He removed the tooth and did an implant now it's in the healing stage.\n\nAfter it heals in 4 months, my dentist plans to do a ubutment/crown on the implanted tooth, and build a bridge to cover the gap of #30.  The bridge would be between #31 (implanted) and #29 (real tooth).\n\nI heard somewhere today that it's not a good idea, because the real tooth \"wiggles\" and if there's an implant attached to it via a bridge, it would \"wiggle\" the implant too and that's bad.  Bridges should be between 2 implants or 2 real teeth, not 1 of each.\n\nWhat's a better idea, what my dentist planned on, or just have another implant on the missing \"gap\" tooth (#30)?  If the bridge is a bad idea, can I just have  the implant on #31 and leave a gap in #30, like I have for years?

Your only option is an implant in 30 region. ppzhao: What about just a solo implant at #31, with a gap on both sides?  I've been chewing on just that tooth for years, and I wouldn't have changed that except the dentist told me it was infected at the root and had to be taken out.  Will a solo implant survive?

    "dialogue": "ASingh: I have front teeth only. 7 in upper jaw and 9 in the lower jaw, premolars and molars are missing. so I went to a dentist and he sent me for a 3D image of my jaw. after seeing these images he developed a plan to install 10 teeth on 8 implants by bridging. 2 up and 2 down on right side with single tooth on each. and 2 up and 2 down on left side with three teeth up and three teeth down. then I started to have tooth implants done by dentist, initially dentist installed four implants (two on left side of lower jaw and two on the right side lower jaw, one out of these four got infection on the right side. so he took that one implant out and cut some bone out as well and treated the infection successfully. later he did some bone-graft in that hole and sealed the gum. he said its all good no infection and the bone graft is good as well. he then took measurements and later installed the three teeth crown on lower left side and it is all good. recently he installed the one implant which was previously taken out and another two implants on the right upper jaw. this  is when all started going really bad.  I had complete numbness in lower right jaw, a lot of pain and lot of swelling, he gave me strong pain killers ibuprofen and panadine extra 2tabs every four hours alternate between the two for about 4 week. also strong steroids 2tabs on day one and then 1 tab for another four days. on the following checkup he told me that I got a nerve pressed by the bone so the numbness will stay like this but there is a 60% to 80% chance that it will get better. I still have some numbness, some pain and swelling after about 5 weeks. so I went for check up again he did x-rays and said its all good. I said to him numbness is bit better, some pain and swelling is still there. dentist said some times it take long time many  months or even years to get better and you will not get back to 100% because of nerve pressed by the bone.\n\nI said to him i have read some reviews in google where they have removed the implant and in some cases unwind the implant a few turns back have cured the numbness. he said damaged is already been done so unwinding few turns or removing implant won't do anything.\n\nplease help me to get my numbness in the right lower jaw treated. \n\nthankyou"

    "title": "Conflicting Advice Received About Decay - X-ray attached",
    "dialogue": "Bert2000: Hello,\n\nI'd be extremely grateful for any guidance.\n\nI had these x-rays taken at the beginning of December just prior to having my fillings replaced. The dentist, having considered the x-rays, asked if I have a sugary diet. I think because of something she observed along the tooth surfaces. I explained that I do not, but have previously not been the best at flossing/brushing twice per day. I asked if the problem she could see was reversible and she said it could be in theory.\n\nOver the past 2 months since that conversation, I have brushed twice per day with a fluoride tooth paste, flossed every day, reduced sugary foods dramatically (basically only fruit), and have recently started using a fluoride mouth wash.\n\nI went to a new dentist for a check-up last week, so 2 months after the previous visit. She takes a new x-ray as I explained there may be a delay in getting the attached ones sent to me. Presumably there would be little difference compared to those taken 2 months earlier. She examines the x-rays and tells me that she can see 1-2mm of decay along the surfaces and that it would be negligent for her to leave it. She says I need 5 fillings, costing around £700. This comes as a shock to me.\n\nI go for a second opinion at another dentist. He said, during the examination, that he could not see any signs of decay. Several days later, after he has viewed a copy of the x-rays taken, he says he cannot see any problems.\n\nWho is right!? DRAVG: Please remember, any advice here is only that and does not supersede your dentists full examination, diagnosis and treatment plan\n\nwhy are you changing so many dentists? (rhetorical)\n\nwho is right?\nDentist 1 and Dentist 2\n\nBoth recognized interproximal decay (decay between the teeth)  between your 2nd premolars and your 1st molars and between your 1st and 2nd molars all on your right side. This is a direct result of not flossing (previously).\nTheoretically, these areas can repair themselves if you continue with the optimal oral hygiene you seem to be carrying out now using the fluoride products you mentioned, BUT only if the areas have not cavitated.\nAnother word of caution, in reality, the decay is much worse than that seen in the x-rays.\n\nDentist 1 took the more conservative approach. Dentist 2 took a less conservative approach. but both have valid opinions.\n\nGuidance: At your next check-up, if the xrays show that the areas have gotten worse (bigger), get the fillings. right now it looks like 1-2 fillings are inevitable. Dentgr: I totally agree with dravg. First priority -ASAP-is the distal of 16 -first upper right molar- and maybe after clinical evaluation the mesial of 47-second lower right molar- Bert2000: Thanks, both of you, for your comments. I really appreciate it.\n\nThe reason I have been to different dentists is that I wanted to have my metal fillings (which you can see in the above x-ray) replaced with composites by a holistic dentist. My usual practice did not offer this. I then wanted a second opinion when my usual practice (but not my usual dentist - I seem to get somebody different every time I go there) recommended the 5 fillings. \n\nThe second dentist also recommended the application of a fluoride varnish and the use of high fluoride (duraphat) toothpaste. What are your thoughts on this stuff? I've read a lot of people say fluoride is bad for you, but on the other hand, it looks as though I need to give my teeth all the help they can get.\n\nYou mention that, theoretically, it might be possible to reverse the decay shown if I continue my optimal hygiene routine every day. If it were the case that the decay were worse than it appears on there, would it be possible to at least halt its progress or slow it down by really going for it with the dental hygiene? I am going traveling for 6 months in a couple of weeks and I am unsure whether to put my faith in really looking after my teeth, and seeing if a checkup in 6 months shows things are no worse than they are now (if not better), or whether I should go for fillings now to prevent potentially worse damage in 6 months. I really do not want any more fillings than I already have, but on the other hand, I don't want to lose more tooth material in the long run by not getting smaller fillings done now than might be needed in 6 months.\n\nI appreciate it is very difficult for you to advise without looking, but any comments you might have would be much appreciated. DRAVG: Ingesting fluoride can lead to toxicity. read and follow the manufacturer's directions and those of your dentist.\n\nGet the largest ones filled, the two mentioned above and distal of the 45 (the lower right 2nd premolar) would be my suggestion BUT follow the advice of your dentist!!!! \n\nYou are getting good advice, trust them. DentalFloss: Hey guys, I have a similar experience (which I detailed in a separate post). Is it common for different dentists to different advice? Also is it possible for dark areas (presumably decay) to appear in one x-ray but not another x-ray of the same tooth?\n\nI guess at the end of the day it's just each dentists opinion on what the best course of treatment is and no one has a right or wrong answer? DRAVG: quite possible for different dentists to give different advice. in my graduating class, there could sometimes be almost as many opinions as graduates. ha ha\ndark areas: possible\n\nwell i wouldn't go so far to say that there cannot be a wrong answer....... but multiple treatment options are indeed possible"

    "title": "Three different dentists all give conflicting advice",
    "dialogue": "DentalFloss: Dear Dentists of the World,\n\nI am a 26 year old living in London and I was hoping for some advice as I've spoken to 3 different dentists and all have different recommendations on what work I should get done.\n\nFirst, I’ll give some details about the dentists I saw:\n\nDentist A: This is a dentist that offers NHS services (certain treatments are subsidized by the government) and private treatments. The dentist I saw graduated dental school 2009 and has been practicing since Early 2010.\n\nDentist B: This is a private dentist in central London. The dentist graduated in 1991 and has been practicing since.\n\nDentist C: This is another private dentist in central London. The dentist I saw graduated in 2006 and has been practicing since.\n\nThe number references I am using are referring to this chart: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikiped...svg/1024px-Universal_Numbering_System.svg.png\n\nIn September 2014 I saw Dentist A for a routine checkup and they suggested replacing an existing (white composite) filling in tooth 19 (lower left) due to decay that appeared underneath the filling in an x-ray. The tooth was not causing any pain or discomfort, but as per the dentists recommendation, I had the filling replaced with another white composite. The dentist suggested that because the filling was large and close to the nerve that I may experience some discomfort when the anesthetic wears off but it should subside within two weeks (in the end I didn't get any pain after the anesthetic wore off).\n\nIn December 2014 I went to Canada and got a cleaning done while I was there. During the cleaning the hygienist said I had good teeth and was cleaning them well. They also noticed a chip in tooth 30 and suggested I get it checked by my dentist when I get back to the UK.\n\nTooth number 19 was perfect until January 2015 when I started getting very mild (2/10) pain/numbness constantly for about 2 weeks. The tooth was not sensitive to hot/cold and I didn't need to take any painkillers but I was concerned. Because of this, and the Canadian hygienist suggesting I get a checkup, in January 2015 I booked an appointment with Dentist A. \n\nDuring this visit the dentist took an x-ray of tooth 19 and suggested that because the filling was so close to the nerve, the next step would be root canal treatment and crown, but I could wait for 2 - 3 weeks to see if the pain subsided, at which point a root canal would no longer be necessary. Additionally, the dentist said I had a small chip in the side of tooth 30 (lower right) which has an existing white composite filling (as the hygienist pointed out to me previously). The dentist suggested the chip had early signs of decay and therefore should be replaced with another filling.\n\nI decided to seek a second opinion so a few days later I saw Dentist B who did the following:\n\n\nTook a periapical x-ray (the whole jaw at once).\nDid a test where they put a very cold liquid on four teeth one by one (two healthy teeth and 19 and 30) - this didn't cause any pain and all felt about the same cold sensation on each one.\nOne by one they put a cotton wool roll under each of the same four teeth asking me to bite down hard. No pain on any of them.\nDid the same test as above but with a solid plastic thing. Again no pain on any of them.\n\nThey explained the x-ray to me in detail and showed me a dark line right under the filling in tooth 19. He suggested this was decay and the best next step would be to replace the filling again. Contrary to Dentist A, he said there was enough space between the existing filling and the nerve and if he refilled it (removing the decay) there is a 90% chance the tooth will be fine. He also saw the chip in tooth 30 which is where the existing filling meets to the tooth, and suggested early signs of decay and that I should also get that filling replaced. When I asked he said there is a 90% chance of this being successful and not requiring a root canal or further treatment.\n\nBecause of the conflicting advice I decided to see a third opinion. By this time I am no longer having pain in tooth 19.\n\nFour days later I see Dentist C who does the following.\n\n\nTakes 4 more x-rays (by putting something in my mouth and pointing the x-ray machine at specific areas).\nPuts cold liquid on tooth 19 and another healthy tooth. I do not feel a difference in either (no pain just a cold sensation).\nAsked me to bite down while putting a hard plastic object under tooth 19. We do this 4 times on the same tooth (different position each time). No pain.\n\nThis dentist then suggested that I don’t need anything done right now. They explained that after a large filling I had in September, the root can take up to six months to adjust and sometimes you can feel discomfort during this time, but as the pain is very mild and the tooth is not sensitive they wouldn't recommend getting the filling re-done or a root canal. Also when they showed me the x-ray the dark line that appeared in Dentist B’s x-ray (taken 3 days prior) was not visible anymore, and it looks completely fine.\n\nAs for tooth 30, they did not notice the chip but I bought it to their attention saying another dentist suggested the filling in this tooth is re-done. They then checked again and said they can see the chip but he cannot feel any decay, and the x-ray does not suggest any decay. They went on to say that as the existing filling in the tooth is large, if it did need to be re-done it may need a crown (or something similar which I can’t remember exactly) placed on it to strengthen it. They suggested I visit back in 3 months so they can check the progress of each tooth to see if any work needs to be done.\n\nSo after getting conflicting advice from three dentists, each with many years of experience, I have no idea what to do. All of them were friendly and very convincing when explaining their suggested treatment. I’m not a dentist myself, so I have no idea which one to listen too.\n\nI would hoping someone on the forum could help me by giving some advice. How can the x-ray from Dentist B show a clear dark line under my filling but the x-ray by Dentist C shows nothing. Are certain x-rays more accurate than others? Is it normal for different dentists to give conflicting advice like this?\n\nIdeally I would prefer not to have to seek a 4th opinion because I don’t think it’s healthy to get so many x-rays in such a short time frame.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice.\n\nThank you,\nMike"

He said that the tooth probably had some more decay and he would open it up and put a crown on. On Friday I went in to have the tooth drilled and get fitted for a permanent crown. The procedure went well, I had the temporary crown put in, and had no pain, until the novocaine wore off. After the novocaine wore off I started to experience some pain around the tooth and figured it was because all of the drilling so I took some extra strength pain medication and it helped for a little while. The second day it still hurt, but not as bad. The third day it really didn't hurt at all, except for a little stinging every now and again. The third night however, my tooth started to hurt even worse than the first day. The top of my mouth around the tooth and the teeth on the lower are throbbing. I have tried taking the same extra strength pain medication I used before and it didn't help. I started raiding the medicine cabinet and found my mom's naproxen that she takes for fibromyalgia and it didn't help either.

I still have the infection there, and there is some blackness around the back of the tooth, but what's the deal on his assessment when the tooth itself is not in any pain, just the gum in between the teeth at the back?

Until I was 16 I never really noticed my teeth but then when I did. Well, it completely destroyed my self confidence within 5 seconds flat. 5 years on I'm still in this same predicament, I can barely talk to people or make eye contact due the fact the way my teeth are, there are only a few gaps on the top and chips on the bottom ones but this is seriously driving me to the point of insanity not having the ability to smile in my own home around people I'm comfortable with and smiling in public is just a complete NO. This has held me back for these past 5 years, with job interviews I've had and never gotten a callback due to the fact I become so anxious and mess everything up in pressured environments because I'm more focused on my appearance and wondering whether they're looking at my mouth. I have been on several academic courses for the past few years recently, which really haven't gone down well with me dropping out due to the fact, this thing is literally controlling my life and social life, all this constant anxiety over the simple act of smiling. And I am really peeved with this, every time I see a dentist it's always the same overly inflated rates of over £1000! I know it's reasonable to pay for cosmetology reasons to boost your ego a little, but surely for people who literally cannot live just one normal day because that person is heading downwards into a spiraling pit of low self esteem, depression and no confidence to do the things they want to achieve in life. Surely fixing somebodies teeth without these ridiculous prices would seem more logical, you're helping somebody in a small way for you but an extremely big way for that person.\nWouldn't it be nice to do something good for once for those less fortunate.\n\nYeah that was just more of a rant than anything, but I really need some advice on what other options are available because I'm 21 years old now and I don't want to have absolutely no confidence in the next 10 years down the fact I can't break a tiny smile just because of a couple of gaps in my teeth."

    "title": "Wisdom tooth gum issue: Trim or extraction?",
    "dialogue": "Jimadine: Hello,\n\nI would like some advice on the most appropriate treatment for a minor problem with the gum around one of my wisdom teeth. I am a 36 year old male, with all four wisdom teeth through, living in the UK. The gum around the lower right one has given me trouble on occasion (say once per year) probably since my mid-20s. The gum becomes inflamed after eating certain foods (typically nuts) and I have to visit the dentist to have him flush the debris out and sterilize the area. The most recent case of this was about a month ago, and I was also prescribed a 5 day course of anti-biotics. As per usual it settled down after a few days. However, one thing that I have become aware of is that, even after it settles down, if I press the gum firmly with my finger right at the back, the gum hurts. Also my finger then stinks (like rot). This suggests there is still an infection, although I wouldn't otherwise notice. If I press the gum on the other side it doesn't hurt nor does my finger smell.\n\nMy previous, now-retired dentist suggested to me 3 years ago if the problem recurs I should have the gum trimmed. My new dentist, when I saw him a month ago, said if it happens again I should have the tooth extracted. My gut feeling is I'd prefer to hang onto the tooth (the dentist said there is no decay) but at the same time I'd like to get rid of this long standing problem once and for all. Some questions that spring to mind are:\n\nI'm not sure who's advice is best here; my old dentist or the new one. How should I proceed? One approach might be to have the gum trimmed and if that doesn't help have the extraction, rather than dive straight into (a possibly unnecessary) extraction.\nWhen extracting a wisdom tooth is it normal practice to also have the other, unaffected lower wisdom tooth extracted at the same time? I can see it makes sense for symmetry but again I don't like the idea of having a perfectly good tooth removed.\nI'm attaching two images (sorry about the image quality). The affected wisdom tooth is ever so slightly angled in the direction of my cheek, whereas the opposite side (not in either image) is almost perfectly aligned with the molar in front.\n\nThanks DRAVG: they are both correct.\nCurrent standard of care is that if you get that infection more than three times extraction is recommended. Obviously the infection arises because you are not able to adequately clean the area between the tooth and the gums leading to the accumulation of food debris and bacteria. you should not want to be on a regular regimen of antibiotics. If you can purchase a plastic syringe with a curved tip (or not) you can flush between the tooth and the gums as part of your normal oral hygiene regimen. Brushing and flossing is also a must. Trimming is a good option, but the gums may regrow to their original height.\n   If you still cant clean the area properly and you have recurrent infection, extraction should be considered. But, because of your age you may have some bone loss behind your second molar after the extraction.\nWeigh the pros and cons and make a decision that is best for your case in consultation with your dentist.\n\nactually you should consider extracting the opposing wisdom tooth (the one on top) rather than the one on the opposite side. Again consult with your dentist. Jimadine: Thanks very much for your advice. I shall arrange an appointment with my dentist.\n\nNo I definitely don't want any more antibiotics. The side effects were not good: a metallic taste in my mouth, a white coating on my tongue which has only just cleared, as well as a feeling like there is something stuck on the roof of my mouth."

I actually bought one of those and am trying it out on occasion. I'll use it more often now. Is there any one in particular you would recommend? DRAVG: Discuss what is best for you with your dentist. Usually a custom night guard works best and should not be too bulky. some have derived good results from OTC products. make sure its a dental night guard and not a sport mouth guard. lee_sch: Really appreciate you taking the time out to get back.

I think this recession was caused by overbrushing - I was a bit heavy handed. I went to the dentist today, and he removed the layer of tartar that was pushing down my gums. Aside from this, my teeth were fine; I've got good oral hygiene aside from this issue.  I've also never had any bleeding from the gums that were receding.\n\nI'm wondering how to go forward with my tooth brushing, now? Twice a day with a soft bristle, from what I can tell...but with what actions? Up and down, circular, or flicking from the bottom of the tooth (by the gum) to the top?\n\nI used to use circular motions, but way too aggressively.\n\nI've read that electric toothbrushes shouldn't be used...I'm rather confused, so I'd really appreciate any advice! I don't want the recession to continue. I'm also assuming that I can't 'fix' the recession, but I'd like to prevent it from continuing, etc.\n\nI'd really appreciate your advice! I don't want to hurt my gums when I brush my teeth before bed! They're a tad bit tender after the clean today. \n\nThanks! DRAVG: Ramona,\n\nsmokers gums bleed less than non-smokers. \n\nyou stated in your note, \"he removed the layer of tartar that was pushing down my gums\", it is quite possible that your recession could be from the accumulation of the tartar rather than overbrushing or may have resulted from a combination of both factors. Sometimes the gums may \"rebound\" and the recession will be minimal.\n\nDefinitely use a soft bristle toothbrush, and if your manual dexterity is normal you can use a manual toothbrush.\n\nelectric toothbrushes are fine as long as you are not overly aggressive.\n\nResearch \"Modified Bass Technique\" for brushing.\n\nGood job on quitting smoking, the tenderness should subside quickly after the cleaning (a day or two). maintain good oral hygiene (brushing and flossing) and now when your gums don't bleed it will be a good sign of healthy gums."

I tried making an emergency appointment at the dentist, but they said they’re already booked.\n\nThe dentist I usually go to is the worst I ever been to. They set up appointments for next month or two, and sometimes the dentists are never on time to call my name.\n\nMy next appointment was at the end of July, so I waited until then. But I could not make it to that appointment because I had to make a job interview…I didn’t get the job. So in August I set up another appointment…they booked me for the middle of September. So I waited all those days, while only chewing on my left side until the day came.\n\nI saw a different dentist that day. She looked at it. She said the filling appeared to be too high. After working on another filling, she lowered it. After that, I went home. After the numbing went away, I decided to get some lunch. I bite down…the tooth still hurt.\n\nThe next appointment was set for November 7th, and that was the last straw. I was done with that place. I went to a different place and I tell the dentist everything, and he tells me to try brushing my teeth with Sensodyne for two weeks and come back to tell the results. I did just that. After two weeks, the tooth still hurt. I go back and tell him. He gives me a referral to see an endodontist to see if I need a root canal.\n\nNext week, I go to said person and tell him everything. He gives me an Xray and tell me my tooth is pretty healthy and doesn’t need a root canal. He looked at the tooth and lowered the filling more to see if that was the cause. I go home and make lunch. I bite down…the tooth still hurt.\n\nThere was no other choice but to go back to the “Fail Dentist” on November 7th. The dentist tried replacing the filling with the smooth texture kind instead of what I previously had. Then after, I go home. After the numbing went away, I make lunch.

I can’t see the dentist until December 29th.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to go. I’m clueless on what is wrong.

He is now suggesting I should replace the missing tooth with an implant. \n\nThere are no cosmetic reasons for doing this. I don't want to go for a bridge or dentures so the choices are implant or do nothing and leave a gap. Cost is not an issue (but don't tell my dentist!). I just want to do what's best for my mouth. \n\nMy instinct is to do nothing but my dentist is suggesting there may be adverse oral health impacts.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of having an implant versus leaving a gap? Any advice or experiences greatly appreciated. \n\nKeith Dr. Garrett Fiorenza: The best thing for your oral health is the implant. These are the gold standard for dentistry today. Implants give you the most natural chewing capabilities, they preserve bone levels, and they support occlusion (how you bite together).  Those are the pros. The con to an implant is the cost, they can be expensive.\n\nThe pro to doing nothing is you don't have to spend a dime. The cons are that area will not have proper chewing ability, it will likely cause some bone loss since nothing is there to maintain the bone, and the tooth that is farther back will start to migrate forward which could effect occlusion. You do 90% of your chewing with the tooth you are missing, so you will most likely feel a difference in chewing ability. \n\nI would suggest watching the area over the next month or two and deciding if you can live without the tooth. Either it will be driving you crazy and you should get the implant, or you won't even notice it's gone (in which case you can do nothing and save some money). Hope this helps,\n\nGarrett Fiorenza, DDS\nfiorenzadentalgroup.com\nGreenwood, IN DRAVG: why did you have to remove the tooth? are any other teeth scheduled for extraction? do you have gum disease? how severe? smoker?"

    "dialogue": "MisterSG1: Hello, let me first say that I am keeping in touch with my dentist on this issue.\n\nAnyways, last Friday, I had 4 fillings done, all on the top. 3 on the right side of the mouth, and one on the left side. One tooth on my right side, I believe it would be one of my molars, (I'm not too big on dental terminology) I was told after the fact that it was a fairly deep cavity. I had a mild cold at the time of fillings, so I was taking the Tylenol Cold tablets. I was better by Sunday with my cold, but on Sunday night, I was having issues with a toothache. On Monday, it was arguably worse, but a couple of tylenol did the trick of knocking down the pain. On Tuesday, I went back to see a dentist at the practice, (an emergency visit) as my regular dentist was not available until Thursday, he did a bite adjustment by drilling the tooth down a bit. Did not work really, as the pain level remained the same. This dentist also told me to avoid hard foods, and to take Advil. Which I have been doing.\n\nNow on Thursday, I see my actual dentist as things weren't really improving. I ask for an x-ray, and while I didn't see the x-ray that was taken, he claimed that there was nothing wrong with the tooth involved. Doing some research online, as I have been lucky with teeth throughout my life, I asked  if I had any abscess or if there was any nerve damage. He claimed that if any nerve damage was done, we would have done a root canal last week. The dentist has scheduled an appointment with me, two weeks from now.\n\nMy question for the professionals on this site is this. Obviously you can't look into my mouth and examine me, but have any of you heard of intense toothache after a filling? A bottle of Extra Strength Advil says not to take more than 3 tablets a day, one dosage if 400mg of Ibuprofen. I find myself replenishing Advil every 6 hours or so. I'm worried about the potential damage the Advil can do to my body. I am currently in the obese category (but I am losing weight, lost 40 pounds since July), and he claims that since I'm a big guy, that I could handle more than 3. I'll safely admit, that at one point last night, I took two extra strength advils about a half hour apart. Well I would like to know your opinion, have you heard of pain after a filling lasting this long?"

    "dialogue": "prb123: Hello there everyone.\n\nDue to night-time grinding, I have substantially worn down three adjacent molars on my LOWER jaw, so I've been fitted with a hard plastic \"night guard\" to wear on my UPPER jaw.\n\nMy question is, I'm worried that this will allow the night guard's plastic to rub back and forth against the worn molars.  Therefore, wouldn't it be better if the night guard was fitted to my *lower* jaw instead, because then the worn molars would be (more or less) better protected from this rubbing?\n\nWhen I had a previous night guard quite a few years ago, and it was fitted to my lower jaw... and my new one is fitted to the upper one... I'm confused!\n\nAlso, I should note that these three adjacent molars are my only worn teeth.\n\nMany thanks for your advice! movemen: Most of the cases, the night guard should be fitted to upper jaw due to the overlapping of the upper front teeth to lower front teeth. The night guard serve to displace muscles and would prevent or reduce the tendency to grind teeth so it doesn't matter if the night guard is fitted to upper jaw"

    "dialogue": "stillhaveall32: I'd like some feedback on my current situation. Due to a number of challenges, I've gone through a period where my dental health and physical health has been neglected, but thankfully things have taken a turn for the better. A quick history:\n\nI'm 47 years old, have all 32 teeth, and never had a cavity until 12 years ago. At that time, I had a dental plan where I paid a monthly and annual fee and received discounted rates from certain providers. After having gone several years without, I went in for a checkup, getting two opinions from two different dentists (in Atlanta, GA), and I was told that I had multiple cavities and that I had periodontitis, and for that reason, I could not be given a normal cleaning. I was given the full mouth debridement / root scaling / planing three times over the course of the year and had my cavities filled.\n\nFast forward six years, and then under a dental plan provided by my employer, which paid for everything up to $1,000. I went to a new dentist (in Monterey, CA), and was told I had periodontitis, with \"pockets of 3s, 4s, and 5s\", as well as 16 cavities that needed to be filled. There was more work that needed to be done than I had coverage or money for, so I told the dentist to address the most important cavities. I had 8 cavities filled and deep cleaning done twice.\n\nNow fast forward to the present day. I'm now in Los Angeles, CA, and just received coverage under Medi-Cal (Medicaid), provided through Liberty Dental. I went in for a checkup and got a complete set of X-rays. The dentist then came in, looked at the X-rays, asked me \"Do you have any pain or discomfort?\" I said no. He then looked in my mouth and said, \"Everything looks great! You just need a normal cleaning.\" No measurements were taken to check for receding gums. The person who did the cleaning commented that there was some bleeding and recommended that I start flossing twice a day.\n\nI am so happy to have been able to get a professional cleaning again! Every time a cleaning special or discount is offered, I had always been told I was not eligible because I needed a deep cleaning and they could not do a standard cleaning. \n\nSo now I'm a little confused. Is this a case of my current dentist seeing that I had limited coverage and thus just gave me what I was eligible for and selectively ignored the rest? (if so, I'm still grateful for the cleaning) Or did my previous dentists possibly oversell me on an unnecessary deep cleaning? Or did my gums somehow suddenly recuperate? And what about those eight-plus unfilled cavities from six years ago? They couldn't just go away on their own, could they?\n\nI'm not in any pain or discomfort. Should I be concerned (or look for a new dentist next year)?\n\nThanks in advance for any input. movemen: It's hard to say without a set of xrays to look at. But I can tell you that every dentist can look at a case and diagnose differently depends on how they are trained, their experience, and their belief.  To me, when a patient come in for a cleaning, I have to check the xray to see any buildups under the gums and floss around to find if the surfaces in between teeth are smooth or not.  If xrays show significant buildups and rough when flossing then a deep cleaning is recommended.  deep cleaning enable me to thoroughly detail every surfaces deep down the pocket and smooth out the surfaces so the gums can heal and educate and enforce daily hygiene with brushing especially flossing.  \n\nlet me ask you this, do your gums bleeding when you floss? and how often you  floss or are you not flossing at all?  check to see if its rough when you floss.  when you go to the dentist again ask to see the xray to see any tiny projections/tags along the surfaces in between teeth.  the one thing you can do for yourself and may prevent lots of dental visits and problems is flossing.  I cannot stress that enough to my patients.  \n\nabout the cavitiies, its all subjective. what i mean is some dentist might see an incipient decay and decide to just watch, some just want to be safe and fill it. may be next year go see another dentist and see how that go. good luck stillhaveall32: movemen said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIt's hard to say without a set of xrays to look at.

I had been been flossing in the morning, but now have been told that at night would be better, and now to floss twice a day, after lunch and dinner. I also wasn't using a technique that was thoroughly flossing the areas; I was only going up and down each surface once, instead of multiple times. It does not feel rough when I floss though. \n\nThanks again! I will try to use this information and not miss any days flossing either. movemen: No problem. The key is to have the areas in between your teeth clean and no rough surfaces. Very straight forward. Good luck"

This shouldn't be happening, should it?  It is my understanding that the implant should be secure to the jawbone with absolutely no movement... am I right or not?\n\nHere is the background info and important info about me as a patient - my childhood dentist is in prison for abusing his patients thus, I have a very intense, paralyzing fear of even simply walking into a dental office. I went 11 years without seeing a dentist because of my fear.  \n\nThat said, I found the miracle of sedation dental about 6 years ago.  I had a great dentist but because of insurance had to switch to a dentist that did not do sedation, but did provide oral medication for a twilight experience during dental surgery. On a recent visit, I was diagnosed with an erupted crown and he advised I needed to have that removed and an implant put in. He also advised that he now does sedation dental and we could do the surgery that way.\n\nSo we did, and it was a terrible, horrible experience... easily the worst dental experience of my adult life. It took him 9 attempts with the IV to get a vein that he didn't blow... 9!! The vein he finally got was in my FOOT of all places. Anyways, I warned him I take more anesthesia than the average patient, but he didn't listen and I woke up repeatedly during the surgery and remember most everything that I had chosen sedation dental to avoid remembering.\n\n8 days after surgery, I was still having terrible pain so he wanted to see me again. I went in, exam, xray, said it looked fine, gave me steroids, more antibiotics and some pain meds with a \"warning\" that he wouldn't refill the pain meds and if this still hurt in a week that he would be forced to take it out.  I felt belittled... as if I was a drug seeker! \n\nUnfortunately, since this surgery, my insurance changed again and my new insurance does NOT cover implants, so I can't go to a new dentist to have this taken care of as I don't have the $1,800 out of pocket that my old insurance paid for this botch job.\n\nI have an appointment with him tomorrow so I can prove to him that this this is moving and that something needs to be done... am I right or does this need more time? movemen: if the implant is moving then it is definitely needs to come out.  just hope the moving part is the healing abutment though and that can be tighten up Dentgr: movemen said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tif the implant is moving then it is definitely needs to come out.  just hope the moving part is the healing abutment though and that can be tighten up +1\nBut since there's noticeable amount of pain I'm afraid it's the implant failing. movemen: If thats the case then it might be the implant failing.

For example, when I have a cold , sinus, or feeling sick, I notice the crown much more and it just feel like an foreign object and very uncomfortable, even though I'm feeling no pain. Is this normal? could i be alergic to this crown (or the cement or the metal post) or something?\n\nI'm thinking of redoing the crown, can I go with all pocelain crown for the upper front tooth? is that strong enough, or is a metal post required? Is same day CEREC machine good enough for front tooth? I was reading somewhere they may not match the color well.\n\nI also feel a lot of saliva in my mouth, could my crown be causing this?\n\nFinally, what's a good place to look for a good dentist for crown? Dr. Garrett Fiorenza: Michaels01,\n\nSome sensitivity is normal after getting a crown. Chances are the crown is replacing a lot of tooth structure, and that can make the tooth sensitive, especially to hot and cold. \n\nDentistry uses very innate materials. Meaning they are safe to be used in the body. Allergies do occur, but are extremely rare and are most likely not the cause of your sensitivity.\n\nAs far as redoing the crown, all porcelain is a very good option for front teeth. However, if you needed a post before you will still need one with the new crown. The post is to help the crown stay in place, without it the crown would likely fall off.\n\nSame day crowns can color match very well IF the dentist is doing some custom shading. Usually dentists don't do custom shading in their office so the same day crown might not be an option.\n\nSaliva in your mouth is probably from you thinking about it. If you are having sensitivity then you are probably much more aware of your mouth and with that comes saliva. I explain it like this: I never notice myself blinking, but as soon as I start thinking about it I start blinking every few seconds. It's not that I'm blinking more, I am just more aware. \n\nI would use google to find a dentist close to you. Dentists are highly trained in crowns, so there will not be a whole lot of difference in care. Pick one who treats you well and you feel comfortable with. Make sure they know your having sensitivity and would like custom shading.

From the outside I see crown, then gumline.. from the inside it goes crown, natural tooth, then gumline... is this normal?? Should I get this crown redone?\n\nAlso I found I'm very sensitive to this crown when I'm tired or sick, is that normal? If I'm healthy, I don't notice the crown as much, but if I'm sick or tired, I sometimes find the crown very uncomfortable?

If you had a toothache you have an active infection in your tooth. Just because the pain is gone for now does not mean the infection is gone. This infection can blow up at any time, and when it does you will be in really bad shape. Dental infections can grow very quickly and cause your air space to close. This means that you will not be able to breathe. \n\nAlso, you should definitely start brushing more to avoid this problem with other teeth in the future. But for now it is too risky to let your fear of the dentist keep you from getting the care you need. Let your dentist know you are anxious and they will help you in any way they can.

I quit chewing tobacco after a 5 year affair with it. This was only four days ago, but every day is easier and easier. I decided to get a dental visit and start the road to recovery for my teeth.\n\nApparently my teeth are actually in great shape. For the dentists here, all my gums were measured at \"3cm\". I'm not sure what that means, but I'm sure you do. The actual question I have is -- how possible is it given my next few statements for me to have oral cancer ?\n\nI was given the Vizilite oral exam where I swished the vinegar/raspberry tasting liquid through my mouth. The Dr. told me to come back in two weeks because two areas concern her. One specifically where I bite my cheek (my left) and the other on my left bottom side where I tossed the chew in. These two areas appeared under the Vizilite and I was wondering how often Dentists told patients to come back in two weeks ? Dr. Garrett Fiorenza: This is very common. The rule of thumb is if a reaction or area of concern stays for two weeks, it might be a little more serious. Most common things such as when you bite your tongue or cheek will go away in two weeks. Now, there are a lot of things that are not cancer that last more than two weeks, so no need to worry quite yet.

    "dialogue": "Kikinaak: I'm new around here, and see a lot of threads with patients complaining about refused painkillers. Well as the saying goes, there are many like it but this one is mine. A little background that distinguishes me in some ways from your \"average\" patient. I was tortured with needles for over a decade as a child. I have a PTSD level conditioned panic response to anything sharp touching me. You CANNOT get a line in me while I am conscious, and that pick is going to be a problem. I have had many horrible experiences with dentists who think they understand panic, when what they actually understand is nervousness and fear. When faced with a total panic response, despite my best efforts to inform them beforehand, they have no idea how to handle the situation, and I have been called many things, told the problems are all in my head, etc. Well, yes, I have several problems in my head right now, they are called teeth. Due to these experiences I generally avoid dentists and doctors in general.\n\nLest I come across as bashing the entire profession, I dont think that way. My experiences overall have been negative far more often than positive, but the good ones have been there. The last good one was a few years ago when one understanding soul suggested \"clearing the upper decks and going for a denture\", in the view that if they were going to put me through the psychological hell that is surgery for me, they were only going to do it once. Life happened and I was forced to move out of that area. Shame, really, I actually liked that dentist.\n\nWhich brings us to recent weeks. First, I brought visual aids.\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/127754010@N06/15454470316/\n\nTour guide mode, as you can see theres problems everywhere. But if you look to your right and turn your attention to what is left of the 2nd molars top and bottom, this is where the excitement starts.\nBoth have rotted out to shells from the chewing surface down (or up) directly into the tooth. These craters extend deeper than the gumline, in fact the upper one has gum tissue growing into the crater through holes in the tooth. Essentially a hernia through bone, and trust me, its less pleasant than it sounds.\n\nThis shot was taken 2 weeks ago when agony forced me into a dentist. I had infection spreading through my gums causing swelling and pressure on nerves. I was prescribed an antibiotic. When I asked for something to manage the pain so I could function, I was looked at icily and told \"we will address this with antibiotics, not painkillers\" I'll admit I am not a doctor, but the last time I checked the two were not mutually exclusive, and in fact compliment each other in providing both relief and resolution, no?\n\nI was referred to a surgeon for extracts. I have a consultation on the 29th with him. His office also told me no painkillers would be prescribed, that I'd have to go through the original dentist for those. The antibiotic is done with, and yes the teeth that were hurting only from the infection, no longer hurt. Meanwhile that lower molar has me literally writhing, cursing, and clutching my face as I type this. I get that no one wants to face the DEA witch hunt, I really do. But its hard to sympathize when I'm the one in agony and being told theres nothing they will do for me.\n\nI am taking 800 mg of ibuprofen, 1000 mg of acetaminophen, 1690 mg of aspirin and 130 mg of caffeine (BC powder). An hour later I am still writhing. I'm also applying clove oil at full strength, but its not getting deep enough. I explained this to the dentist, he apologized but still refused to prescribe something that would grant actual relief. Considering my mother died of renal failure, I am really not liking the idea of long term ODing on the OTC stuff.\n\nI'm not going to rant on this dentist, or the image he presents of the profession, though I'm sure some of you will forgive me for having less than pure thoughts on the matter. What I am asking for is advice, what more I can do for some pain control that is legal and wont use my liver as a punching bag down the line? mVo2: so sorry about your pain, I had terrible pain recently with 4 abcesses. My nerve was involved. constant stabbing pain. If it helps to know that narcotics didn't even tough my pain, clove oil helped much more. also I called couple times a day and said it was unbearable nerve pain, I was taking 3 advil every 3 hours for weeks and really messed up my stomach... anyway finally they tried steroids. which REALLY DID HELP! maybe you can ask for steroids? 1 week worth to settle down the nerves?"

It's been there 24/7, continuous. Can anybody come up with reasons why this is happening? And the solutions to this problem. Thanks!\n---------------------------------------\nFYI I brush my teeth very diligently every morning and night and do not have any tooth decay. And I've been wearing my retainers for about a year after taking off my braces.I am very concerned about whether it's happening because of enamel erosion/nerve issues/gum problems... drmins: This pic alone can not help in diagnosing the situation.However,please do let me know if,\n1) Have you got any sensitivity upon cold or sweet food?\n2) Does this \"shock\" aggreviate on blowing air? Or upon cold water gargling?"

They look like they could be decayed already and will continue to get worse the longer you wait to get them out. Oral surgeons and some general dentists offer oral conscious sedation. This is where you take a pill that makes you feel really sleepy and will not remember the actual surgery.

Talk to an ENT doctor (Ear, Nose, and Throat), I'm sure your dentist can give you the name of one.\n\nAs far as thrush, I do not see any in your pictures. It may be in another location that I cannot see. Usually thrush will go away after you stop taking the antibiotic that caused it in the first place.

    "title": "Infected tooth extracted yesterday,awful experience,pain/swelling today.",
    "dialogue": "Avi: Hi all,\nI had a lower tooth, second from the back, which had been rotting for some time, leaving quite a big hole in the middle but the outside of the tooth was still there. I've had a fear of needles since i was young and this is why i put off going to the dentist. Around a year ago i was in a similar situation and had severe toothache with a different tooth and i knew i had to have it extracted as soon as possible. I plucked up the courage and went to the dentist, had a filling first on another tooth and then went back to have that one extracted. I didn't feel a thing when the tooth was being extracted, only pushing and pulling but no pain. The dental nurse was lovely and made me feel at ease. However, that dental nurse retired a while ago and i had to see a young male dental nurse. The dentist looked at that tooth only, nothing else, not my other teeth, gums etc. He then proceeded to prod around the tooth with something which started to cause me pain. I asked him what he was doing and he said that he was 'scraping and cleaning out the tooth'. I told him it was sore, and he said that he had made a small pin prick in an abcess which was under the tooth,and he told me the pain i felt was caused by the release of the pressure. He then started to wobble the tooth from side to side, which again, caused pain. The dentist said the area looked infected and gave me two options. 1. He could give me anti-biotics and get me back a week later to extract the tooth. 2.He could 'try' and remove the tooth there and then, but couldn't guarantee it would be painless due to abcess/infection. I decided that as i was already there, i might as well just have it extracted. I was given two injections, the first one was very painful and the second was more bearable. I was sent to the waiting room and waited maybe just over half an hour which i thought was a bit long. The left hand side of my face went numb, the left hand side of my head and ear also went numb. Back in the chair, the dentist wiggled the tooth about and the pain shot right through me which i wasn't expecting at all. I was expecting some amount of discomfort but nothing like that. It felt as though my face, head and ear was numb but nothing else, not the extraction site. I screamed and he asked if i wanted to stop, but i signalled for him to carry on as he had started and i couldn't walk away with half my tooth hanging out! He started again, meanwhile the blood was running down my throat and the dentists assistant was standing watching. Eventually i heard a crack and he told me that was 'one half of the tooth out'. I signalled and tried to ask one of them to use the suction thing to get the blood out of my mouth and the assistant done it. Round two for the second half was just as bad as the first, the pain ripped through my face, mouth, jaw etc and i was screaming, digging my nails into the chair and kicking my legs about, it was that bad. I realised how silly i must have looked and apologized once he was done. After the extraction, i started shaking, felt cold, dizzy and the dentist said i looked very pale. He asked how i was getting home and when i replied i would be driving, he told me to sit in the waiting room for a bit and if i still felt unwell, he would arrange for a lift for me.He also checked the extraction site and said it looked 'spot on'. I asked if he should put some gauze on it and he said no, leave it as it is. The bleeding stopped quite quickly but 33 hours later i still have swelling around my jawline, it feels like i still have toothache and the pain made me cry earlier. I have been taking Co-Codomol and placed a hot water bottle on the area, i am still only able to eat soft foods like soup and noodles on one side. How long should i wait to go back to the dentists about the pain? Should the dentist have extracted the tooth knowing i had an abcess/infection? Should he not have put some gauze on it? This has been a terrible experience for me and i really don't want to go back but i can't suffer the pain. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this, i know it's quite long! drmins: Unfortunate that you had  painful session. \nThough some docs say to remove the infectious foci (source of infection) as soon as possible,i always follow an antibiotic therapy before the surgery. This can help in reducing the pain for patient and help aid better anesthesia.\nYou have stated above that you had been using hot water over that area. Bur since when?\nThe first 12 hours,its recommended to use cold or ice pack and then you can use a mild warm towel over the affected side.You can go for a saline gargle as well.\nMild to moderate swelling is usual if you have a traumatic extraction,like if the bone was cut.\nBut,if you swelling is huge and painful still,you need to seek further treatment.Is the swelling too hard? Avi: drmins said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBut,if you swelling is huge and painful still,you need to seek further treatment.Is the swelling too hard? Hi and thanks for the reply. I had put a hot water bottle over the area after 24 hours from the extraction. My jaw is still tender to touch and there has been a constant dull ache on the side of my face/where the tooth used to be. I was worried about dry socket but since it's been 3 days since the extraction, i think i would know if i had dry socket. The pain isn't excruciating, it's just aching and i'm getting slight shooting pains around the area. The swelling around my jaw isn't a huge swelling, it's barely noticeable when i look in the mirror but when i touch the area it feels a bit hard and tender. The pain radiates to my left ear and temple as well. If it's still this way on Monday, i will go back to the dentist but for now, it's bearable. Thank you. drmins: How long did you take the analgesics or pain killers after extraction? Are  you taking them now? And antibiotics?\n\nI think your issue is well manageable with medication (antibiotics and analgesics).\n\nGet well soon."

(Potential benefits and risks)\nWhy is mercury used in dental amalgam?\nDoes mercury leak out of the fillings?\nWhy is this product still on market?\nAre there better alternatives?\nWould you recommend your patients to have amalgam fillings? Why? drmins: Amalgam has been used in dentistry since ages. If done with proper triturations and handling, these are very safe.\nThough there are now opinions suggesting leakage of mercury from the restorations,these are very minimal.\n\nYes. There are many alternatives for amalgan fillings. The choice of amalgam in my practice depends upon or varies with cases.\n\nThanking you\nDr. mins LisaP80: Amalgam is made of silver, tin, copper, and mercury. The large part of it is mercury, which acts as some kind of 'glue' to make the filling strong and durable. \nThere have been some concerns about the mercury leak, but I agree with drmins that the case is very minimal in numbers. As long as you make sure to make regular checkup to your dentist (every 6 month) it should be okay.\nThe product is still available on the market largely because of two reasons: it's cheap, and the reported cases of mercury leak is minimal.\nThere are various and better alternatives compared to amalgam fillings, The most commonly used alternative is the resin composite fillings. This filling has teeth-like color, but it is less durable and more expensive. Other notable alternatives are glass ionomer cement fillings (best for minor filling work) and gold foil fillings."

Many years ago it was recommended that I get braces to close the gaps as much as possible to prevent the need for making goofy looking large teeth to fill the gaps. Later another dentist said braces weren't necessary.  \n\nI'm looking for some general opinions based on the photos attached.  Can porcelain veneers be used to reshape and fill the gaps or are braces needed?  And if braces are recommended, could invisalign braces work  or are traditional braces needed due to size of gaps?\n\n I will be going into debt to get the dental work done, but at 47, I do not want to live with this smile any longer. So I want to be practical but I also want to know all my options for the best outcome.  Bottom teeth are crooked in front with some gaps but don't bother me much as they rarely show when I talk or smile. However the positioning may be affecting my bite. LisaP80: I think you have a cute smile though \nYou need to consider several things before you pick either options.\nFirst, in terms of price, the porcelain veneers would be much more expensive than braces.\nSecond, in terms of efficacy, the porcelain veneers would be a much faster solution.\nNote that you may need multiple veneers, that could cost a lot (at least for me). I wouldn't recommend invisalign braces because it is used to make minor changes to the teeth structure. I doubt that it would make any significant changes.

This is a pragmatic question, and I am not a delusional person trying to get attention. it concerns my teeth which have been caving in for the past ten years.\n\nMy lower teeth and jaw has been getting narrower and narrower, almost caving in towards the tongue on either side. \n\nOk so here is what my question is: \nFor the past ten years, due to anxiety my top right and left teeth been exerting what i think is pressure on my lower teeth. I do not grind or physically push the upper push on the lower teeth. \nI have this \"tic\", its a nervous tic, where i push the upper incisors on the lower ones and i feel the pressure on the lower teeth, and a clicking sound as the teeth are being exerted on. over the years i must have done this thousands of times, and the effects are indisputable.\n\nThis is not imagjnative or paranoic, my teeth have actually bent over the years. I know this is real because my lower teeth are so close go my tongue in either side thag they make it cumbersome for it to be there; my old retainer doesnt fit and show a much wider jaw and teeth areangement (even my bone has been bent after thiusands of these tics), and my metal retainer inside my mouth that is keeping my front teeth straight is obviously visibly bent, like a bent crowbar. My cheeks have caved allt and my lips are wrinkly because they do not have the same jawline. So this is not fiction. \n\nNow what im asking is how could this happen. Ive researched noncontact forces and came up with: electricity, gravity and magnetism. Now can i assume that there is some field in between the jaws, i dont think thats eer been recorded and i am not out to be the first. How about stress, can it exist through the air. I can come to believe my mind is transferring its anxiety unto my lower jaw, that whole mind spoon bending apparently has no scientfic evidence, so what i'm asking is what is happening to me.\n\nIf you need proof i can send you photos of before and after. all i need is your educated advice, so please help me. JosephRAdorno: Carving of teeth is because of abnormal teeth growth or simply just a case involving genetics, it is extremely important that you have your teeth checked by dentist or orthodontist . If you leave the situation untreated, the teeth which might be starting to carving in will cause additional damage in the future. Some people have noticed their front teeth carving in and some have experienced their particular side teeth carving inwards. The location is an excellent initial indicator involving why your teeth are caving in. For example, if your returning molar teeth are caving in then that may be an indication that you will be affected by influenced wisdom teeth."

    "dialogue": "Peachy123: Twenty-five years ago I had a root canal on tooth #19. It went fine; the tooth had three roots as opposed to two. About five years after the tooth with the canal broke and it was capped. About five years after that it broke again and was capped again. Now fifteen years later I have a fractured root and an infection and my dentist told me to have it removed. I was referred to a periodontist to have it removed and have a socket preservation and bone graft. My insurance will only cover the extraction and the periodontist wants me to pay up front. All of this is fine; I said I would pay for the extraction and chose not to have the socket preservation and bone graft; the cost of those are $3000 and I cannot afford it. Since then both my dentist and periodontist have called me multiple times to explain that I will have bone loss from the infection and if I don't get it done it will affect the shape of my face and cause irreparable damage in the future. They want me to know that it was an option to fix it now so that I won't come back on then later and say that I wasn't given the option. That's the long story. What I want to know is , will my face shape really change? Do I have to have this done? No one put me on oral antibiotics though I did have treatment with Aridex (I think that's what it was) and it didn't help. I feel I'm being forced into something that I simply cannot afford. It's just not feasible. They've told me that eventually the surrounding teeth will cave in and can come loose as well. They also said that a dental implant was a better option but insurance won't cover it. It's possible I could get some work done at a dental college nearby but the appointment for the extraction is tomorrow and I don't want to go in there feeling like I have to have this done and then basically feeling like crap for not having $3000 to get work done. Dr.Vishwanath: Just because of a single tooth your facial appearance will not change drastically, trust me. It will affect your grinding and chewing functionalities though.And also the space created by the removal of your tooth can cause your other teeth to drift causing spacing. But it will take time. \n\nSo what I suggest is you go for the removal of tooth now and then replace the missing tooth whenever you can afford. \n\nHope this helps\n\nDr.Vishu"

I thought mucoceles weren't supposed to hurt. Could you give any insight, please? Iworry: Anyone?"

    "dialogue": "jkb2108: So to make a long story short, I haven't gone to the dentist in about 7 years, due to my fear of all the injections I have to get to become numb, and I finally went about 2 weeks ago. Had 4 small gum line cavities (molars 19, 29, 30, 31- I hope those are the right numbers!) my dentist said they went a tiny bit under the gum during the fillings. Honestly most of my appointment was spent getting my teeth actually numb, once he was drilling he was only on each individual tooth for less than a minute-about a minute. I expected to be sore considering I got them all filled on the same day, could still feel part of the procedure, and the amount of injections I had to have in my lower jaw. All of this work was done a little over a week ago, haven't had any sensitivity to heat and very minimal sensitivity to cold (I've had composite fillings before and the cold feels pretty normal for my teeth). I've had a couple bite pressure zings on 2 of my teeth, but that stopped after day 3 or 4. My main concern is that three nights ago I woke up early in the morning to throbbing pain, I couldn't pin point a tooth, but it was coming from my right side. I stood up, and within 45 seconds the entire pain was gone, and I experienced the same throbbing last night, but again not a specific tooth. I also have a soreness on my right side (where I had 3 fillings) and it tends to feel aggravated when I eat anything hard. But again to clarify, it's not painful, just almost feels like I flossed my gums too hard or how your teeth feel right after you get braces. Are my teeth just trying to recover from being drilled, or do I have a more serious problem here? I definitely don't have a bite problem, due to the fact my fillings are on my gum line, and it would be pretty noticeable, and I've had a high bite on previous fillings so I know what it feels like. \n\nI almost feel like I'm almost making my teeth feel worse then they are, like I could possibly be clenching my jaw in my sleep and making myself believe there is truly a problem. I've been reading a lot about reversible and irreversible pulpitis, does it sound like I have the symptoms of either? \n\nI'm waiting until the end of the week to go back to my dentist, so any suggestions on what might be going on would be greatly appreciated!"

    "title": "Uncured composite filling to root canal",
    "dialogue": "khabibul35: I had a white composite filling done in February. After a while I started having pain and the dentist decided to redo it. While redoing it, she discovered the agent hadn't cured. She redid and the pain subsided. However, now it's back. I went back to the office but that dentist has left the practice and they're now telling me a root canal and that I need to pay full price for it. They are ignoring redoing the tooth or the uncured filling altogether.\n\nCould the uncured composite in my tooth have been the reason for my needing a root canal? If so, should I really have to pay full price? khabibul35: Longer version:\n\nHi, thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope someone finds this interesting enough to give their opinion and maybe help me out.\n\nIn late February of 2014, I went for a cleaning and to get my teeth checked. It was the first time in 5 years, although in that time I have been pretty diligent about brushing and flossing. I wasn’t surprised though that I had some cavities and that some of the teeth that I had work on previously that the fillings had to be redone. Everything went pretty smoothly (at first), and my first work was 3 fillings (3, 13 and 20).\n\nThe one that went wrong out of these was 13. After about a month, I started having pain in the tooth. I don’t remember exactly when, but she finally got around to it maybe 2 or 3 months later because she initially thought the sensitivity might go away. Everything looked fine on the x-ray, but she decided to redo the filling. After she drilled, I noticed an unusual reaction from her. As she was working on it, I asked her what was going on and she said that the material had not cured. I inquired a bit further and she said that it must have not been done long enough last time and that perhaps her choice of trying to cure a full filling all at once had been a factor. This time, she was going to cure it in 3 steps to make sure it cured.\n\nAfter the filling, the pain seemed to get better but I was still sensitive. She said it would be normal for that to be the case for the next few weeks since the nerve was sensitive. After the work was done, I felt sensitive for 3 weeks (mostly when I flossed and occasionally with chewing+ cold food) but thought it was normal. I went on a month vacation and during that time the sensitivity got even worse. I still don’t feel much unless I’m flossing. But the irritation while I pull down on the floss is getting worse (and it’s definitely not the gums because the pain is coming when I pull down and in the tooth nerve area rather than the gum area).\n\nAfter vacation, I went back to the dental office but my dentist had left and I was assigned a new one. She immediately referred me to an endodontist and he said I would need a root canal. Furthermore, he said it was a deep filling in the first place that was a candidate for a root canal and so really, she tried to make it a filling but that sometimes it just doesn’t work and so it’s entirely normal. I asked him about the uncured filling exacerbating but he brushed it off saying, it “may have” affected the nerve but he couldn’t know for sure. I then talked to the “office manager” and she was even more flippant. She said she’d never heard of a filling not curing on the inside since “if the outside is cured, the inside just cures with time”. I told her that it’s what the original dentist told me but that she’s been in the field 16 years and never heard of anything like that but that she’d “check with the orthodontist”. At that point, she asked if I wanted to start the root canal today and handed me the estimate. I politely declined saying that I wanted to get to the bottom of this and get a second opinion.\n\nFor me, this is more of a case of trying to find the truth rather than a case of avoiding financial responsibility. I’m not a professional dentist, so I don’t know what might have happened here. However, it seems to me like the original dentist knew something was wrong and was trying to fix it but now that she’s gone they’ve gone into a mode of “cavities turn into root canals all the time and we tried our best”. They don’t seem to want to acknowledge that this redo is not a usual thing and that the uncured agent sitting in my tooth for a few months could be causing this. All I really want to know is what I should do… keep waiting for the sensitivity to go down or get a root canal. And if I get a root canal, is it really fair that I pay for it considering the way it all went down."

I recently had many fillings and deep cleaning in my top teeth - one half was done on one visit, and the second half (quadrant) was done on a second visit with a different dentist.  In the picture below, you will see that the two sides are no longer identical in color - the right side (from our perspective) being much whiter.  The difference is even more notable in person.\n\nIs the \"whiter\" side the result of dentist error somehow?  The dentist who did that side also left a lot of filling material in between my teeth and I had to go back to have it removed.  I am also concerned because the DDS who did the fillings on the left (from our perspective) took around 2 hours for the procedure, whereas the DDS on the right took about 45 minutes, and there remains alot of sensitivity to cold and difficulty flossing on that side.  \n\nI suppose my question is why are my teeth now stark white on that side, when they were identical before, and the teeth on the left are still the natural color?  I posed this question to the DDS and he didn't really have a clear explanation. \n\nAny thoughts?\nThanks! LADentalclinic: I'm not sure which teeth and which surfaces had composite fillings done on them, but if each dentist used a different shade, this would account for the different colors.  There are at least 20 different shades in composite kits."

    "title": "Debating on getting surgical extraction Wednsday, help!",
    "dialogue": "alessadry: Well, let me start saying that I am dental phobic, but other than that, there are several things that are causing me to debate if I should wait a bit to get a surgical extraction for a piece of old root canal from 15 years ago. My appointment for a surgical extraction is next Wednesday and I am debating if I should cancel or get it done with. Here are my issues:\n\n1) I will be leaving for Italy in the next 12 days after the procedure, a total flight of about 18 hours. I am terrified if after the extraction I will end up with complications and have to fly or can no longer fly after spending all my savings on that ticket. For some reason, I take long to heal from mouth issues and get mouth ulcers that last for days after dental procedures. \n2) I have lost a great deal of weight in the last months. Saw a doctor for it and he ran tests and couldn't find anything wrong with me. I am 38 years old and used to weigh 113 pounds and now I am 102.6 in the morning! I am scared to  be on a liquid diet for several days and lose more weight. I don't feel in top shape and look forward to relax in Italy. When I go to Italy, my mission is to gain weight and feel better, and then perhaps I would be in better shape to endure the surgical extraction.\n3) I have been having ulcer-like pain these past days. Feels like I ma producing a lot of acid and get hunger pain that gets better once I eat. It could be just the stress of thinking about the surgical extraction, I wouldn't be surprised as I tend to worry and get diarrhea when nervous. If I am having these gastric issues, I cannot imagine myself taking pain killers (known for causing gastric issues)  for days and eating a liquid diet. \n4) I am afraid of having some bleeding issue and maybe should run some tests before the extraction-- therefore perhaps should postpone it. Several years ago had a mole removed and the surgeon had to cauterize it to stop the bleeding. Then had a polyp removed and the obgyn had to also cauterize. Also, had a PAP test done a few months ago and the obgyn was rough and I bled on and off for 15 days at a time! For some reason, I feel like I bleed longer and more than I should. \n5) I am planning to go off the contraceptive pill while leaving for Italy and once back it may help being off since I heard the pill may interfere with healing and may cause dry socket. I am planning to stop the pill completely once back.\n6) Since my weight loss, I have been prone to infections, I have been getting yeast infections almost every month and even urinary tract infections. My doctor thinks it may be the pill. So if I get it done now, I am afraid if I get a mouth infection after the extraction. Again, may be better once off the pill.\n7) last but not least, the pain has considerable lessened. When I called the receptionist she told me \"it won't get any better\" but it really has! The pain started after a piece of this tooth fell of 10 days ago and after eating hard pretzels. My husband had pain too after eating the hard pretzels. Before, the area would really hurt when I passed the toothbrush there and now I barely feel it. It just bothers me a bit when I an inhale or eat cold food, but it feels more like sensitivity than real pain. I wonder if it's just the gum being sensitive after the piece fell off?\n\nBut then, I am terrified if the pain should increase and cause problems the day I must fly or during my vacation! Also, it's annoying when food gets stuck up there, but if I could hold off perhaps until next month when I come back from my vacation I may be more prepared,  will have gained weight (I always do when vacationing in Italy) and perhaps be in a healthier state.  Any advice appreciated, sorry if this is long!"

I am a bit hesitant since I am not in major pain; it really only hurts when I eat. I would appreciate another opinion. I have attached my xray below. LADentalclinic: Your inlay is very close to the nerve.  That may be why your dentist suggested a root canal for your discomfort.  Before you agree to the root canal, you should have the dentist check your bite and make sure that you're not hitting the inlay too hard.  Even if you're hitting it a \"little\" prematurely, it can really make your tooth sore.  The bite is easy to adjust.  I would try this first, especially since you are not in major pain."

Thank for any help.. LADentalclinic: You should wait 36 hours before rinsing with salt water which it sounds like you have passed.  This is to prevent accidentally spitting out the blood clot which would leave your bone exposed. (Dry Socket) You don't need to use a special toothpaste, just be gentle.  I wouldn't think that you'd still be bleeding by now.  You can stop biting on gauze when the bleeding stops.  If you are still bleeding try biting on a plain wet tea bag.  Tea contains tannins which help with clotting.  I hope this helps."

Oddly enough, I felt that my teeth were rough just after the scaling and I told the dentist about it. He informed me that it was normal and that everything would be ok with time. So, I completely forgot about it although it was the first time I got that feeling and it was a bit annoying (I underwent 5 scaling before and did not have that feeling). However, one week later, I felt some pain in the gum and then in the hard palate. It was moderate at first, and then it became severe. So, I was obliged to see another doctor for that because I had already left my country. The new dentist had a look at my oral cavity and he shocked me. To my surprise, the scaling was so aggressive that the ultra sonic instrument made grooves on my teeth especially at the backsides of the teeth. But according to that dentist, it was not very serious, especially that I did not have a problem of hypersensitivity. However, the pains were very severe and I still suffer from it. It is a burning and tingling sensation in the palate and the gum. I was 26 years old then. Any relationship between the aggressive scaling and the pains? alat: any help please?"

I have also been brushing around the tooth with Corsodyl dental gel. To my mind, taking an antibiotic is a last resort.\n\nNormally, I'd wait a few more days to see if the problem clears up. However, I am going on holiday in 13 days and, if I leave it too late, I might not be able to get an appointment before I go away. My dentist didn't tell me what to do after taking the antibiotic. Should I make an appointment or just wait until my next check up?\n\nThe pain is not getting any worse, so I'm wondering as to whether to make an appointment today or giving it a few more days to see if it clears up. LADentalclinic: The problem with dental infections are that you can go to sleep feeling fine and wake up the next morning with half of your face swollen, and then you'll be racing to the emergency room for IV antibiotics.  That's a very miserable experience. It would be better if you make your appointment now to avoid any unexpected misery, especially with your upcoming vacation. Paul: I did make an appointment and got seen the next day. The infection seemed to be clearing up but the dentist persuaded me to have the tooth removed. Hopefully I'll have recovered from the extraction by the time my holiday starts. I'm going to some remote islands where there are no emergency rooms so I think it was as well to have the tooth out.

I had been going to one for 3 years and he was fine...never had one cavity while seeing him and my last cavity was probably 15 years ago. He retired and I automatically got the one who took his place. She was MAYBE 30 years old so not that experienced. After my exam with her she tells me I have 3 cavities! Kind of odd after not having a single one for 15 years and 2 other dentists. \n\nSo I get all three filled. One is fine, one is a little painful and the other one is horribly painful when chewing on anything. I go back a week later with the pain and she grinds them down and tells me to wait a few weeks to see if things get better Well the one with the lesser pain gets better in about 4 weeks but the other one still hurts just as much. Finally three months later I go back because it's ridiculous that the pain has not subsided at all in the one. At my appt the hygenist seems mystified as to why it still hurts and then the dentist comes in and asks me on a scale from 1-10 how much it hurts and I tell her \"pretty much a 10\" and she seems mystified. Once again all she does is grind it down, no x-rays or other opinion as to what could be the problem) and then tells me to bite down on a wad of cotton when she's done as it should apparently be miraculously healed. Still just as much pain to which she says \"Well give a few weeks and see if it gets better\". I've been waiting 3 months for it to get better I don't want to keep waiting! \n\nAnd then this is the kicker that really stuck with me. She says \"Well if this doesn't work then my bag of tricks is empty\"! Even if she said it in jest, you don't say that to a patient! If the tables were turned and she was the patient would she not be miffed by that statement? What about x-rays to find out what the problem is? \n\nI went to a new dentist who took x-rays and saw that not only was there an air bubble which was causing the pain but that there was also some decay left in the tooth! No amount of grinding was going to take care of that! I got a new filling by the new dentist and my pain was immediately gone! \n\nI decided to write a bad review of my previous dentist on Yelp and I got a personal letter in the mail from the dentist saying it was never her intention to cause me pain, yadda yadda. Then about a week later I got a response on Yelp from the other dentist who runs the practice saying \"We are very sorry to hear about your bad experience. We pride ourselves in high quality, honest dental services along with a good patient experience at our office. We also always stand behind the work we've done and take concerns very seriously, making every effort to resolve problems personally when they're brought to our attention. Immediately upon receipt of this complaint via indirect sources we refunded all costs associated with the treatment to allow for full patient satisfaction, despite the review otherwise. The claims asserted do not reflect the standard of care we hold ourselves to, and we always make every effort to ensure a high level of dental health and patient happiness are maintained.\" \n\nThat's all well and good and thank you for refunding my money. However I responded back to him about that comment from the other dentist of how \"If this doesn't work then my bag of tricks is empty\" and if he, as a patient, would return a fourth time to the same dentist to have a painful tooth fixed if the past 3 times didn't work and he had heard that comment? I told him that after that comment I wasn't coming back even if the tooth DID get better. Haven't heard anything back yet. \n\nWas it wrong of me to blast this dentist with a bad review? What would you do if you had heard that comment?"

My dental pain has never been this bad.\n\nAbout 2 months ago, a lower tooth - the canine tooth - began throbbing intensely.  Despite my money is low, I had no choice to go to a dentist. He was shocked to see that all of my teeth are in bad shape due to a life-long, unconscious habit of grinding my teeth during intense stress.  (And there has been a ton of stress in my life.  The lower canine was deeply infected, and he put me on antibiotics and gave me a few pain pills with the instruction to return in a week to have it pulled.\n\nThe problem was that I could not afford his extraction fee.  So, the tooth festered, and the pain grew worse with time.  About a month ago, I went to another dentist, and he offered to pull it for a cheaper price.  I agreed because I could not take the pain anymore.  It was keeping me awake at night and preventing me from eating.\n\nI was excited about the extraction date.  I thought that the pain would finally be over, once the extraction healed.  I was proven wrong.  Instead, the pain in that area has intensified greatly, despite the fact that there is a big hole where the tooth used to be.  I went back to the dentist, and he diagnosed a dry socket.  He packed it with clove oil and numbed it, which lasted 6 hours.  After that 6 hours though, the pain returned with force.\n\nI waited a few days to see if the pain would calm down, but it did not.  Instead, it grew worse.  I called the dentist back, and he said he'd pack it again.  But, I was deeply upset and offended when he stated, \"I will not give you any more pain medicine.\"  I am not making up this pain to get the pain medicine.  This has left me in tears.  I just want a break from the pain.  I know from before that packing the tooth will not dull the pain. \n\nI have an appointment scheduled with him this afternoon, and he will numb it again and pack it.  It just really hurts that he treated me like a \"drug seeker\" and not someone in pain. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for me?   I feel like pulling all of my teeth because this pain is so bad.  The tooth behind the extracted tooth is also in bad shape, so I'm wondering if it's contributing to the pain.  This dentist never examined the other tooth, but the other dentist did. \n\nI do not expect a large or medium quantity of pain meds.  I just want enough to get me through until it stops hurting.  It hurts emotionally that he is treating me this way.  It's not like I do not have any teeth that cause pain. \n\nAny feedback would be appreciated.  I have tried all sorts of home remedies, from ice to everything else under the sun.  I am at my wit's end with this tooth.  I have not slept in nights because of this painful tooth.  And, unfortunately, I do have a family doctor to turn to now.  I do not have insurance, so I'm up a creek.\n\nThank you so much for any and all feedback. LADentalclinic: I'm sorry that you're in so much pain.  Dry sockets can be miserable.  Very often they have to be packed several times to provide relief.  As you stated, the pain could be coming from one of the other teeth.  At some point it would be a good idea to have a complete checkup so this kind of thing doesn't sneak up on you again.  Are you able to take Ibuprofen?  This is the drug of choice for many patients with dental pain because it helps with pain and inflammation.  It is a good alternative if you are unable to get more prescription medicine. 800 milligrams at a time can be tolerated by most people but it's best to check with your doctor or pharmacist.  Some areas have community dental clinics that charge reduced fees based on income.  This may be an option.  If there are any dental schools in your area they offer dental services at greatly reduced cost as well."

He started me on a 10 course of clindamyacin and 5mg of Norco. 3 days of starting this I called him and told him the pain was too intense and I requested to see him asap. When I went in he removed the molar right next to the impacted wisdom tooth. And referred me to a oral surgeon to get the wisdom tooth surgically removed. I cannot get in to our only oral surgeon in the area just for a evaluation until June 18th than I don't know when I actually will receive\nthe surgery (hopefully soon) last night I went to the ER in severe pain and facial swelling\nthe ER doctor gave me more of the pain medication and gave me another 10 day course of the clindamyacin. I still have facial swelling and it doesn't seem that the Norco is giving me any relief its a very deep throbbing pain. I have a lot of concern 8 years ago I was hospitalized for a week for a dental infection that ended up turning into osteomyelitis I ended up on antibiotics for a long period of time and getting the tooth extracted this was on the other side of my mouth tho. I also have had MRSA twice not dental but I don't know if that could be a possibility of all this pain. Im really stuck on what to do, I hurt so bad to the point I cant sleep eat. Should I go back to ER or maybe my dentist? This is horrible please help!! LADentalclinic: You need to have the source of the problem treated as soon as possible.  It sounds like the antibiotic is not working.  Perhaps you can try a different antibiotic.  Can you travel a little farther to see an oral surgeon who has openings sooner?  You need to have the tooth removed ASAP because the constant presence of infection in your blood stream can adversely affect other parts of your body.  I hope you feel better soon."

I was expecting cavities and molars pulled but it turns out because of my molars my lower jaw has been pushed out of place. I believe this problem is called TMD or TMJ? My jaw is dislocated and to repair it I was told I will have to wear braces for a year and then a splint. I live in an isolated area- my dentist won't take my new insurance- and the braces will cost aprox 6000-8000 dollars - the splint 800 to 2000- and my current cavity and molar bill is 3000 - I only make 14k in a year. I can't ignore my dislocated jaw but I can't afford to fix it. Help, what can I do? LADentalclinic: Is there no other dentist that will take your insurance? You may need to look in your neighboring area to find one that does because utilizing your insurance can greatly reduce your out-of-pocket cost.  Before you worry about braces and splints, you need to take care of all of the cavities because they get larger and more expensive to restore the longer you wait.  Remember, you don't have to do everything at once.  Fixing one tooth a month is better than doing nothing at all.

There is a dentist that will take my insurance one town over but it will be hard getting back and forth and they will not be able to help with the orthodontist stuff- only the cavities.\nI think that's what it's going to have to be for the time being. My partner has offered to help pay so I think I will be able to afford to get one section of cavities done every 2 months and the molars I want to actually do all together in one sitting to get it over with.\nWe may have to move to an area where we can get better help and perhaps better income.\nIt's been hard not to worry about. Every day we use our mouths for eating, talking and sometimes things like singing or laughing etc- and for me I have slight lock-jaw when I yawn or when I chew and it can build up into bad headaches. It's hard to ignore some days and I'm worried I'll wake up and it will be far worse all because I didn't have the money to get things taken care of. \nI feel like this situation is truly a product of modern poverty and it's terrible. I can afford a television but not my own health. I've thought about it and even if I sold everything we both own we would only have half the money to pay to fix my jaw. That's depressing.\nI'll try and keep my head and jaw up- Thanks."

    "dialogue": "Bobby: Hi all. Been dealing with this and it's really stressing me out. Any help would be awesome.\n\nMy lower right incisor was knocking against the top teeth after my wisdom teeth were removed, so my dentist filed a millimetre off the top. It stung, and kept stinging for a day afterwards, but died down soon after. After a while, the front tooth next to it began doing the same thing (knocking against my top teeth), so my dentist filed that down too, but in doing so, accidentally ground down the incisor again. It was only for a second when he slipped over, but there was immediate pain. It went, and then came back perhaps an hour later. The pain has since grown, and my tooth feels very sensitive and cold, like when you drink ice water. Immediately after the grinding, the tooth felt hot/cold. Now it's mainly just a cold pressure. It's just on that tooth, and it has been perhaps twice as long since the pain died down the last time. I've tried drinking water, and it only gets super cold on the incisor.\n\nDo I have permanent nerve damage? Would I know if my inner enamel was completely exposed? Will the pain die down? What should I do? \n\nI can't find anything on the internet (typing grind comes up with grinding teeth at night - typing filing teeth comes up with stories about fillings), and I don't want to go back to my dentist without cause and pay more. Any help would be super. I am having terrible anxiety about now having to live my life with an exposed nerve or something, and feeling the sensitivity forever. LADentalclinic: Adjusting the bite doesn't normally cause pain unless too much of your natural tooth was removed.  You can try over the counter sensitivity toothpaste and avoid chewing on that side for a while, but if the pain continues you will need to have it checked.  If you still trust the dentist that you saw previously he or she might not charge you to recheck the area.  If you no longer trust them a second opinion from another dentist may be a good idea.

Thanks for your reply. I'm dubious about going back to the dentist, but will probably if it doesn't die down. If the pain *doesn't* go away however, and say, they removed too much of the natural tooth, what options would I have? I wouldn't have to have anything serious like a root canal would I? Couldn't they just add something to the top of the tooth or something? LADentalclinic: It's difficult to say without seeing the tooth.  A bonded filling may help, but if the nerve is damaged a root canal would be needed.  Let's hope that the tooth settles down on it's own."

    "dialogue": "steveweaver99: Hi\n\nI have been having a consultation with a Dentist no for over a period of several months (almost a year) and have had root fillings on two molar back teeth.  However I believ the Dentist is not providing a good service and dragging money out of me.\n\nThe first root filling I had done (and also wanted a crown which I was happy to pay for) had three visits to clean inside the roots.  Each time he put  temporary filling to protect the roots.  However on the final visit he did not fill in the roots and instead of preparing for a crown he just built up the tooth with composite filling and wanted to charge £125 for that.  I asked why he did not fill and put a crown and he replied because he wants to wait for the tooth to settle for several months.\n\nThe second toot was split so he extracted part of it (charged me for it full cost of extraction) and then proceeded with a root filling, again with three visits.  This time he filled the roots on this tooth and said he would build it up like the last one.  Anyway since then the tooth has become loose and an abscess has formed on the gum and he now wants to extract it and I will have to pay for the extraction.  So I had all that work done and the probably knew it would need to be extracted? \n\nMy thoughts are why isn't he preparing and giving me the crowns as I wanted, I ust think he wants to continuously draw money from me, your thoughts?\n\nThanks in advance.\nSteve LADentalclinic: What you're describing sounds very suspect.  Have you considered having a second opinion?  Based on what you're describing a second opinion would probably be a good idea. steveweaver99: Thanks, I have already started the process for a second opinion.  Would that just be a normal checkup and to ask for a report on the work done?  I would like to reclaim all the money I have paid to the Dentist as he seems to be getting nowhere with the treatment. LADentalclinic: You will need a checkup and ask for a written treatment plan.  Also, if possible get copies of your x-rays from the previous dentist so you don't have to pay for them again.\n\nGood Luck steveweaver99: Thanks for your time steveweaver99: The second opinion Dentist said the root canal has a 40% chance of survival and there is an infection there.  The previous Dentist charged me for a root filling and canal treatment, therefore which was done less than a year ago, is that grounds for a refund?  Theother tooth has no chance and has to be extracted with the possibility of an implant procedure. LADentalclinic: Unless the second opinion dentist said that the root canal was done improperly you might be out of luck.  An x-ray would show this.  I've seen this happen many times. The first dentist may choose to give you a partial refund but if you can't prove malpractice, unfortunately it's up to their discretion."

One RCT was done approximately 7 years ago and the tooth restored using amalgam, whereas the other RCT was done approximately 2 years ago and the tooth restored using white composite. \n\nMy dentist recommends that both teeth be crowned as soon as possible. I agree with him… However, he has warned me of the high risk that the teeth may fracture during crown preparation and that they ultimately may have to be extracted.

How high are the risks and how are they best minimised?\n\nMuch appreciated!\n\nSam LADentalclinic: In my experience this is a rare occurrence.  Without seeing your x-ray I can't say for sure, but most crown preps performed by a skilled practitioner are done successfully without the loss of the tooth.  Pins and posts can be used to reinforce teeth that have fractured.  The tooth can then be built up for a crown.  If the fracture occurs in certain areas such as below the bone, the tooth may not be restorable, but that doesn't necessarily happen often."

The reason I do that is because I feel that is not necessary as its more like a routine checkup rather than him actually tightening my braces. At most times it takes him less than 5 or 4 minutes to do his work, he would only thrust some pointy things onto the bracket which i presume is to check on somethings, I don't really know, this usually happens when I make visits on short intervals like one month or 1.5 months. Only at certain points (which I presume is when the braces really is lose) of my visit that I have him taking out the whole archwire and then replacing it which takes about 10 minutes or longer than the usual poke my bracket procedure.\n\nMy question is, would I be risking anything if I don't follow up with the regular 1 month visit advice (which I think is unnecessary, correct me if I am wrong). Maybe risking a slowdown in estimated straightening of the teeth or even risk having my teeth going back to its original bad position? Right now one of my bottom archwire is detached from one of my brackets which resides at the end of one of my tooth so I am desperate for an answer.

The apparent level of subjectivity in the field of dentistry is frustrating me.

If you have some experience looking over dental images, then please post your suggestions. LADentalclinic: Not sure why anyone would tell you that your teeth are rotting away based on this x-ray.  I can see several areas that appear to be decay between your teeth.  These are caused from not flossing.  Some dentists prefer to \"watch\" areas of small decay and wait for the decay to get bigger while others like to take care of them as soon as they are visible.  If you choose to go the \"wait and see\" route, you'll want to have new x-rays taken in 6 to 12 months to make sure that the decay doesn't get out of control.  Remember, the larger the cavities get the more expensive they will be to repair. bob1: Well, they didn't quite say \"rotting away\", they just said there are over a dozen cavities that must be filled.  They talked to me like I was irresponsible for letting my teeth get so bad.

I was told they would be sore for a while. \n\nI waited and waited but the one tooth ended up hurting just as much as it did right after the filling. Finally in February I go back. She didn't seem to understand why the one hurt so much because all the fillings were so small an near the surface. She ground down the one some more and asked me if it was better now when I chewed on a wad of cotton and it hurt just as much. She said to give it some time (like 4 months wasn't enough!). She also said that as far as the hot/cold sensitivity goes that maybe I'm just one of those people who will have to deal with it. She said if the grinding down this time doesn't help then she doesn't have anything more in her bag of tricks. \n\nWell I had enough of her and looked for a new dentist. I went in yesterday to see the new one for a general overall look at my mouth. X-rays were taken and before the dentist or hygenist told me what was up, I was able to figure it out for myself. The tooth that hurt showed a black spot under the filling which I figured was an air bubble. Sure enough, that is what the dentist told me it was as well. Why didn't my previous dentist simply do an x-ray to find this? \n\nNow I need to have the filling taken out and redone but my insurance has a clause where it won't pay for filling being redone for up to 2 years so I have to pay $245 out of pocket for an error that was made by the previous dentist. Do I have a right to ask the previous dentist to cover my cost since it was their error? LADentalclinic: Absolutely.  If possible, get a copy of the x-ray to take with you if she is unwilling to refund you.  It would be much easier and less expensive for her to give you your money back than to face a lawsuit."

If the decay is into the nerve you would need a root canal to save the tooth.  Definitely see a dentist.  The longer you wait the worse the cavity will get. steve: Thanks. Now I will try to convince my folks of this. If I can't what recourse can I have? They really take their beliefs seriously."

Temporary partials aren't as strong as permanent partials. You may have to cut your food into smaller pieces or bite with the natural teeth that you have left instead of directly on the front of the partial.  The best solution to restore missing teeth are dental implants.  If you're not interested in implants you may choose to get a permanent partial in a few months after all of your healing has taken place."

I never had any problems with them as they came out, and while they're not perfectly in line with the other teeth, they're not pointing out at weird angles or anything.\n\nYesterday I noticed a dull ache in the gum above my back-right wisdom tooth. The gum itself is tender, but only directly above that tooth. The tissue itself doesn't feel swollen compared with the gum on the other side, but it does feel like there's a 'pressure' in there (to the nerves in my gum, not the nerves in my fingers, if you see what I mean). Poking it has led to an increase in pain.\n\nI brush my teeth twice daily, and floss (though perhaps I missed something right at the back...? It's hard to get all the way back there), and though I have slightly receding gums in my front-middle molars, I've never had trouble with the two back teeth on either side of my mouth. I recently switched to an electric toothbrush to help avoid further gum recession.\n\nPericoronitis has come up in some web searches but that seems to affect partially erupted teeth. Does anyone have any ideas?\n\nSlightly complicating this is the fact that I just arrived in the US for three weeks and don't have insurance that would cover dental bills, so I'm reticent to shell out for a dentist if other ideas could prove useful early on. Alternatively, if there's any way to get free dental care (or if I can just wait it out till I return to my own country) I'd love to hear it. Thank you!\n\nEDIT: Pushing the tooth doesn't result in any pain at all - just the gum. So is this probably just a gum infection? LADentalclinic: You may have gotten some food stuck under your tissue that is irritating the area.  (Example: popcorn kernel) If your pain continues you should at least have an x-ray and exam.  Wisdom teeth can be very hard to clean so you may have decay in an area that you cannot see when you look in the mirror, but it should show up on a x-ray. MisterSix: Thanks! I think it might actually be a mouth ulcer on the outside of my gum, where it connects to my cheek tissue - I'm going to wait a bit longer and see how I go."

I was putting on some of that MI Paste this evening and the filling fell out! Why would this happen? I just spent a lot of money getting dental work done so I am not happy. Do you think the dentist is going to charge me to get it repaired? Does this happen a lot or did I have poor work done? thomas m mcconnell: Dear Amanda, Fillings do fall out despite the best efforts some times. There are many reasons they can fail. In any case, 3 days is to soon and I think any fair minded and self respecting provider would welcome the opportunity to redo the filling at no charge. LADentalclinic: Sometimes if there is not enough retention in the dental prep a filling will fall out.  Also, if moisture got on the tooth while the filling was being placed this could cause the filling to fall out.  Either way, contact your dentist who will more than likely replace it at no cost."

Of course, you would need a chemical that won't cause the minerals in your teeth to come apart, because that would be... unpleasant.  My question to you is, are you aware of chemicals that are safe to use, like this that can do this?\n\nI have read about one product that can supposedly do almost precisely what I have described above, it is called Periogen.

But don't trust any testimonial you read on the same site that sells the product, ever! LADentalclinic: Definitely dental snake-oil.  Dental calculus must be manually removed with special instruments because it is extremely hard.  It can be prevented by frequent brushing and flossing.  Plaque is soft and easy to remove but when it is not removed it hardens into calculus."

Dear Hiren, From the x-ray you provided  you have a very deep cavity. It is fair to say that you should get treatment for this tooth as soon as possible. The least you can expect that needs to be done is excavation of all decay and a filling.  If the decay has invaded the pulp (nerve), then a root canal is necessary to restore the tooth back to health. The fact that you may not be experiencing any pain is not the reason you should use to prolong or avoid treatment. You do in fact have \"trouble\". The x-ray shows a huge cavity that if left untreated will likely give you a memorable dose of pain and discomfort in the foreseeable future. LADentalclinic: I would definitely seek advice from a dental professional and not someone with no dental experience.  From your radiograph I can see that you have decay that looks like it extends into your pulp chamber.  I also notice darkening around the tips of your roots which is also a sign of infection.  If you're not experiencing pain, it may be because the pressure that builds up in an infected tooth can escape through a hole or opening in the tooth which you clearly have.  If the opening is sealed pain and swelling usually occur.  I've personally had a root can and see several patients daily who need them.  They're not nearly as traumatic as people think.  They just take a long time to do but you're numb so you shouldn't feel any pain."

Matt: Thanks Stefany.   I was hoping to avoid braces etc but if I had to I'd definitely prefer invisalign after doing some research about the pros and cons.  Do you think I'd be a suitable candidate?  \n\nI was hoping something could just be done to the 2 teeth in question, as the general crowding of my other teeth don't really bother me. stevengoldy: yes, of-course invisalign is the best alternatives to metal braces for your teeth."

    "dialogue": "Danny-r: Hi, \n\nI've been in major pain for about a month with no visible changes in the tooth, right sided upper molar. About a week ago I noticed the centre of the tooth going black and this had extended towards the outside of the tooth to the point that the whiteness of the tooth had become translucent and you could see black within. 1g of paracetamol and 400mg of ibuprofen often is not enough to make the pain go away and I have to try and sleep when I get the pain as once I wake up the tablets have kicked in and the pain has gone. I assumed, after a bit of research, that it was a root canal and I expected to have the treatment for that or have it pulled.\n\nSo I went to the dentist today and he asked me, \"Do you have any pain.\" I replied yes and showed him where. He asked when do I get it. I stated that it is often triggered after eating and drinking. He tapped it a few times (which hut) and then looked at my gums and sent me to the hygienist. I am in intense pain with a tooth that is going black. It seems like he's assumed I have sensitive teeth (which I do have) but it isn't hurting because of the temperature of the food, it's just that can trigger off intense toothache. \n\nAm I right in not been happy with this response or was this the right thing for him to do? chrisloo: if it were me i would have it pulled, i would rather have teeth pulled instead of having this that and the other treatment and being in pain from it all, your dentist sounds alot like my old one, can't be bothered. trust me, there is no pain killer that gets rid of toothache."

    "title": "Conflicting advice",
    "dialogue": "Brad Bellomo: I had a dentist at a small practice that I liked and saw for about 5 years, paying out of pocket, and only occasionally needing a filing or to replace an old one.  Then I got married, and my wife has dental insurance, so I chose to change dentists because of the insurance.  They sent me to a large corporate dentist (As many locations as McDonalds), which did my first visit.\n\nThe corporate dentist took x-rays my first visit, refused to do a cleaning the same day, and told me I immediately needed 13 fillings or I would soon need 13 root canals.  I was surprised, as I saw my dentist regularly and my teeth have always been fine.  When I question this, I was told it was very obvious, and I should get a 2nd opinion if I had any doubts.  So I asked for a copy of x-rays and treatment plan and was given a small X-Ray printout with small circles hand written and a piece of paper that said \"Treatment plan: advanced cleaning, $135, 13 fillings $585\".\n\nI took these to my old dentist, who understood the insurance situation and was happy to do a brief consult at no charge.  She said tooth 29 definitely needed a new filling and a large filling on tooth 2 was cracked and needed replaced.  She also told me the cracked filling was so large that by the time it was removed there would be so little tooth left I couldn't get another filling and I needed to have that tooth capped.  She said there was absolutely no reason to fill the other teeth, that some dentists are more conservative and others more aggressive, but in my case doing so much unneeded work was unscrupulously trying to make money, and how sad she was that some dentists bring down the practice like that.  I asked her how much she'd charge to do just the two teeth if I paid her cash, and got a quote for enough to buy a nice used car.\n\nMy wife is handicapped, and will probably be fired when her FNMLA runs out and I will lose her insurance as well as her income, so I wanted to get the cap done as soon and cheap as I could.  I went back to corporate dentist, and said I got my 2nd opinion and wanted to just take care of 2 teeth before doing anything else.  They told me on the phone they'd be happy to do as much or as little as I wanted, and I should schedule an appointment first to do a cleaning and I'd be able to talk to the dentist to change my treatment plan.  However when I got to my appointment, they said I had to have expensive antibiotics with my cleaning.  I told them I didn't want this and they said over the phone that they would do as much or as little as I wanted and they told me that they'd refuse to keep the appointment unless I consented to the antibiotic.  If I didn't take it today, they wouldn't let me talk to a dentist or schedule anything other than an advanced cleaning with antiobiotics.  I went ahead and did it.\n\nAfter my cleaning, the dentist I talked to the first time was busy, so they sent me another one.  He said a cap on any large tooth with a large filling was good, but he'd recommend capping tooth 3 (Not even one with a circle) instead.  When I explained tooth 3 was fine according to both dentists, he showed me my x-rays, and asked me which filling was bigger (the cracked old filing on #2 or the relatively new filing on #3).  He also started getting mad at me about not wanting to fill the other teeth.  He got really mad but said if I wanted a filing on #29 and cap on #2, he'd be happy to do it.  So I scheduled 2 appointments, the first to do the filling and prep for the cap and the 2nd to do the permanent cap.\n\nWhen I showed up for my cap prep, I got the first dentist.  He said the dentist I talked to must be blind and I obviously needed the other filling.  I told him he was the one to get a 2nd opinion, and he told me I should get a 3rd opinion and he was disappointed in me for not trusting him.  He kept showing me the x-rays, and I kept trying to explain to him that not having gone through dental school myself, I did not feel I could decide if a filling was needed.  The cap prep was miserable, I bled a lot and the temporary cap wouldn't attach, and the appointment took forever.  I was relieved when he told me he wouldn't have time to do the filling that day and I would get it with my permanent crown.\n\nThe permanent crown appointment was yesterday, and it went very well.  It only took about 20 minutes to put the cap in, but then he started arguing about the other fillings, getting mad at me and pretty much told me to leave.  When I asked about the filling on 29, he told he didn't have time to do it and I would need another appointment.  Then he took out my x-ray and showed me tooth 28 and 29 and asked me how anyone would want to fill one and not the other.  I did get a copy of a real treatment plan (lots of MOs, MODs, etc) which I asked for and another printout of my x-rays which I told them I didn't want (but wanted a digital copy and they wouldn't give it to me).  I also successfully got them to refund the cost of filling 29, since they didn't do it, and didn't offer to schedule another appointment (I didn't push the issue).\n\nI hate the pushy used-car salesman approach of the corporate dentist, but the cap is excellent work, feels and looks just like my natural tooth and much better than it was with the old huge metal filling and tons of wear.  It also cost me less than a regular filling at my old dentist would.  So should I go to yet another dentist for a 3rd opinion?  Should I let the corporate dentist fill whatever he wants?  Should I try to just get him to do #29?  Should I just go on living with 1 or more cavities?  I can upload a scan of my x-rays or treatment plan if anyone thinks that helps."

And has been the only time since) somehow a piece of the burning tobacco fell onto the tip of my tongue and burned it. Ever since then I noticed the tip of my tongue actually had a tear/ slight piece missing, I can't believe this could happen, I thought for sure it would heal by now, but it has not and there is a slight rip in the tip of it and I cant stand seeing it. Is it possible to have an oral surgeon or dentist stitch this to mend it? I know this isn't an ordinary situation, at least not that I'm aware of. I really just want to have my tongue without this nuisance. I don't think this was there before the incident, or that I just noticed it when burning my tongue, does anyone else have slight tear/gap in the very tip of tongue to the bottom part of the tip? It is mostly noticeable when I move my tongue, I can see it. Insight is greatly appreciated. (Posted this on oral surgery but no response, thought I'd see if I could obtain help on this section).\n\nThank You. danielhermann: The situation seems to be intense in your end, i believe you need to consult a good dentist who can assist you in getting that tongue reconstructed or some cosmetic surgery that can make your tongue look full, at the same time do avoid tobacco for retaining better oral health. JJ7: I am not a smoker, I was at a celebratory event and did this for the first and only time. Regarding the tongue, would that be a complicated procedure you think? It is really quite a small flap, barely noticeable until moving it. Or is it possible that I have always had this and just never noticed it, because I've seen there to be tongues that have an indent at the tip for some people. But mine looks more like a \"tear\" and is straight in the middle of the tip, a bit crooked but down the middle of the tip. And would it affect my speech if one was to get stitches?\n\nThanks."

What would happen if I just leave it as is? If I don't extract the remnant, will it decay and cause gum infection? Is there a way to glue some artificial tooth on it so that it can be fixed cheaply?

If you are  working on your budget, then you can try dental tourism to save a lot of buck. My friend and I travel right across the border in Mexico that cater almost exclusively to Americans.

I feel dreadful.\n\nMy question is that if this is indeed caused by the fact my jaw is out of line, then isn't that just a little coincidental that the pain has started directly after a deep filling, considering I've never had constant headaches before? I just don't want to continue having headaches, wait on a waiting list for a night guard, pay £215, wear it for a few weeks only to discover that it isn't the cause of my pain.\n\nReally confused... should I go to the doctors? Should I go back into my dentist and see if they can have another look?\n\nThanks for any advice.\n\nEDIT: Oh also, I said I haven't really been getting pain in my teeth, I do sometimes feel some pain but it's quite dull and only seems to be my molars, and not specifically the one I got the deep filling on. \n\nJack"

    "dialogue": "Tobo: I have 2 Q's Sorry this is kind of a long post but I need to make sure I explain the whole story. \n\n6 days ago I broke a small part in my tooth and it didn't seem to hurt or bother me until 2 days later I started getting pain. I went to the dentist who confirmed I had a tooth infection most likely caused by the recent cavity. I was given anti-biotics (Amoxcillin) which was told would take approx 48 hrs to kick in and start working and eliminate the pain. That night the pain got a lot worse and I was forced to go to my local hospital injury unit and demand strong painkillers as the pain was that severe. I was given Co-Codamol which helped reduce the pain somewhat but not eliminate it. I have been taking these (responsibly) for 2 days while waiting for the anti-biotics to start clearing up the infection but I am still in some pain although not as in as much pain as I was before I mean its tolerable just uncomfortable. I am on my 3rd day of taking the anti-biotic Amoxcillin and there has not seemed to be any signs the infection is clearing up (like any pain reduction). Is this right? should I wait a little longer? I only have enough tablets for today and tomorrow before the course ends.\n\nSomething else I have noticed has also happened; I have noticed a boil behind my gum above of where the infected tooth is and am guessing this is the pile up of the infected liquids I know this as I have had this before. Twice. I have had problems with the same infected tooth twice before you see and both times there has been the same thing suddenly appear around the infected tooth only this time its not outside the gum but inside where its hard to see. The last 2 times it was punctured (once by the dentist and once by myself) and that seemed to eliminate the pain greatly and help. I am wondering if the anti-biotics will be useless as long as the bubble remains 'un-punctured' and the poison inside it remains to cause the pain. I look at it using a mirror in my mouth and notice this one seems to be more totally red and not a little green on the other ones I had on the front of my gum when I had this same problem before. Does it really matter what color it is? should I just gently puncture it and get the contamination out like I have done before or what? I make sure to do it carefully using a clean needle etc only this time it won't be as easy as its harder to see on the back of the mouth. \n\nIs the blood/skin bubble a sign that the anti-biotics are not working? will they make it go down or will it stay there? thanks. LADentalClinic.com: HI, \n\nYou should give you dentist a call. He has seen what is going on in your mouth and would be more readily able to answer your questions. He will most likely recommend that you come back in, as it is very difficult to diagnose problems without taking a closer look. I hope this works out for yoU!"

David Smith: White spots on gums is often linked with tobacco use. It can also be a sign of infection, an allergic reaction, or a reaction to bleaching chemicals used to whiten the teeth. If the cause appears to be allergies, adjusting the diet, changing oral health products, or stopping a tooth whitening program may resolve the white spots.\nAnother cause is the development of bony growths in the jaw.\nPatients who notice white spots on gums accompanied with extreme tenderness, bleeding, or puffiness may want to consult a dentist."

    "dialogue": "DDR4321: So, about 3.5 months ago I started to notice very weird symptoms....dizziness, disorientation, nausea, weakness. At first I thought it was just anxiety so I kept quiet and tried to deal with it on my own. Then, my head started hurting on the left side and pounding. Then, the left side of my neck started to swell up, then my lymph nodes on my neck and underneath my arms (and even behind my legs) began to hurt off and on. THEN, I started experiencing tingling and numbness throughout the left side of my head and neck. At this point I went to the ER. While there they gave me an MRI of my brain, which check out to be normal. All of my blood work, normal as well. \nThen I went to the dentist after researching on my own more. Alas, they found 10 cavities. Three of them REALLY bad and in need of root canals (all on my left side where the neck swelling and head pains/sensations have been) These infections were going into my nerves and jaw even. Well, I had the third root canal yesterday done by one of the best root canal dentists in the Midwest. During this appointment he said one of the other two root canals I had done might have to be extracted because the dentist that did it, \"over filled\" it and went way to deep, consequentially making a way for harmful bacterias. He also said it looked like it might have small cracks in the tooth. \nThe most disconcerting about all of this is, now I'm feeling constant tingling, muscle twitching in my legs!! Like all the time! I have no idea how this could be related but all that I know is that I NEVER had ANY of these issues until all these dental infections caught up with me. \nIt seems pretty coincidental that these issues would begat me all at this same time. \nAt first I thought auto immune disease like MS but, like I said my brain MRI looked totally normal so, I don't know what's going on but this is REALLY depressing me. This may sound silly but, is it possible for a bad tooth/tooth infection(s) to set off nerves and sensations in other parts of the body? Perhaps a response to bacterial infection in my mouth? I'm totally miffed. \nMy general doctor had no idea what to make of this and just wants to put me on masking medications for it. Despite my third root canal, the left side of my neck is still swollen and my throat just feels tight, I have intermittent pain behind the left ear as well...I generally feel weak and fatigue and am quite nauseas off an on throughout the day/night. The good news is, the dental work i've had done so far has helped in subsiding much of the equilibrium and severe dizziness/disconnected feeling issues I was having. Also, before the work i've had done thus far, my neck was ballooned up even bigger than it is now. But I still have significant swelling that hasn't subsided though. \nI still have four/five untreated cavities on my right side to be taken care of, although indications from the X-rays anyway, indicate that they aren't as severe or root canal worthy. The left side of my head isn't in like acute pain or anything, but the whole sensation of the left side of my head is just off feeling, it feels different than my right side of my head.\nWhat the heck do you guys think is going on?? I'm so worried and depressed, i'm starting to feel hopeless and defeated about my life in general now. I was feeling fit and healthy up until August really. Also my older brother died from dental issues back in 2000, following a couple root canals...the bacterias from those infections went to his heart and he died in his sleep so, perhaps there is a special hereditary thing going on here I don't know, but that's obviously been on my mind as well. What do you guys think???? Please help me.\nSorry this was so long, thanks for reading."

I barely had a cavity there, but the dentist kept drilling. There is barely any \"tooth\" between the filling and the nerves. I was in pain for three months solid. I lost 30 pounds because it was so hard to eat; I lived off smoothies and soups. I get random bouts of irritation still, but nothing major. However, ever since that filling was done I've had this lesion around the tooth right behind the one that was worked on. It's been itchy lately.

    "dialogue": "Replicant: Hello all, I am a 26 year old male that has always had a huge fear of the dentist. Well recently the cavities on all four of my back molars and my wisdom teeth pain was finally enough to push me over the edge. I had my wisdom teeth removed as I was told I needed to in order to have any work done on the back molars. Now 2 of them are very \"small\" cavities that should be an easy fix, the 3rd is ugly looking but still needs just a crown. The 4th and last though is absolutely terrible looking. I have had this cavity for years so you can imagine its condition. The entire back portion of the tooth and fractured off leaving that nasty black/brown/grayish decay. My dentist has assured me that they can all be saved and no root canals are needed. I asked about extracting at least the 4th since it looked so bad and I just wanted it gone and was told that was a bad idea and completely un needed. I am missing the entire back half of the tooth, leaving only the decay left on the portion. Is this truly still salvageable? I just done want to have the crown done to have to go back later for a root canal or extraction. The tooth is sensitive to cold/hot, but in the X-rays my dentist has showed me it is not yet to the nerve. Has anyone had experience with having a tooth this far gone and crowning it?  With the amount of the tooth gone would you recommend extraction? Thanks CraigRWS: I've felt that it's always preferable to salvage a tooth, if as your dentist says it hasn't reached the nerve I'd go for that option. It does read from your message that your dentist knows what they are doing. If you have doubts, get a second opinion. I'd only look upon an extraction as a last resort."

    "title": "Serious problems with teeth/jaw",
    "dialogue": "mar_ok: Hello, \n\nSo in order to explain the severity, this post may end up rather long. \n\nMy last trip to the dentist as a kid was when I was 16. I was told to have had several cavities  and a few root canals. My family couldn't afford everything so they opted to help the most severe problem which was the root canals. \n\nWhen I was 18 (now 28) years old, I had a cracked tooth (Upper left, second tooth in the far back). I was unemployed and was couch surfing through peoples houses in order to get by, while searching for a job. I literally had no money, and lived off a good portion of Top Ramen. The pain was so severe so I cracked the tooth out with a pair of pliers. This left shards of teeth where the tooth used to be. The tooth had been previously root canaled before that, so while there was pain, it was still somewhat tolerable. \n\nBetween 18-20 I didn't really notice anything terrible so I just kind of rolled with it, assuming things would be okay. The cavities didn't seem like they affected me, as I didn't even notice they were there, but they were. I was unable to afford any trips to the dentist, as I barely made enough to get by. Living on minimum wage, out on my own. The company I worked for didn't offer dental. \n\nAround 21 I developed my first problem, one of my bottom back teeth had abscessed, it looked as if I had put a golf ball in my mouth. I went to the ER and they directed me to an oral surgeon. The only choice was to sacrifice the tooth. It was pulled, and because they had to put me under it ran a few thousand dollars, as well as a few hundred in pain medication.\n\nLater that year, the same thing happened on the right side of my mouth, same opposing tooth. \n\nNeither of these times was I able to afford the removal of the shattered tooth shards. \n\nAround 22, I developed a grind, I grind my teeth so horribly and I don't even realize that I do it most of the time. \n\nWhen I was 25, I received my third abscess, upper left far back (prior to the wisdom). The company I was working for paid to get a root canal, and a filling, but couldn't cover anything else. \n\nShortly thereafter the company laid me off as they were having a financial crisis. \n\nAt 26, I moved to North Carolina as rent was coming up, and I could not afford what my room mates at the time required. My friend offered to take me in. I gladly accepted and did my best to find a job. Regretfully, it was North Carolina, I was 26, had no job, no car, was living off unemployment and using that to pay what rent I could, and eat. My grinding problem continued to worsen, and I have grinded and fractured some teeth. My front tooth has been cracked and I can see a cavity developing. My friend had graduated college, and took a job for a big company in another state. I was having no luck on the East Coast, so I came back to San Diego, found a job, and have been working there for the past few years. \n\nThe problems, the company doesn't offer me insurance as I am a temp. The insurance the temp agency offers is very poor and saves only 6 dollars or so on the 1000. While it may add up, the company itself doesn't pay more than 10 an hour (with no chance of a raise, unless you get a promotion) as we are all considered permanent temps.\n\nNow, I am living in California off 10 dollars an hour, living on my own, I make it by, by I don't really have money for leisures, my nights consist of staying inside. \n\nSo what I can visually see, without x-rays: \n\nA cavity on near every tooth (brown looking specs)\nedged/jagged teeth from grinding\nsome teeth appear to be rotting out\ngingivitis buildup around some teeth (I brush 3-4 times a day, wash my mouth out with mouthwash 2-3 times a day) I believe this is because I have grinded so much enamel off my teeth, that no matter what I do; they aren't getting protected, on top of the problems that have been building up for years. \ngums developing peridontis (black developing on the end of the gums)\nfillings from when I was 15 started to deteriorate, causing severe pain\ngrinding getting much worse (noticeable clenching, pain in the morning: more severe the past 2 months)\nSevere jaw pain, from what I am reading online it seems to be TMJ/TMD. I have a very difficult time opening my mouth wide, without pain in the back left of my mouth, somewhere in the middle between my upper and lower wisdom teeth.\nMassive migraines / headaches due to the clenching/grinding of my teeth\n\nNow, this is just what I can see, so I know the problems will be much worst than what I can explain, especially under an x-ray. \n\n\nSo I am 28, and living paycheck to paycheck, not a great life, but I have a roof. The dental problems I see there would be multiple thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work. There is absolutely, no way I could ever possibly afford something like this, unless I won the lottery, and I can't even afford to buy a ticket <_<. \n\nI'm expecting the answer to be \"you're screwed\", but I have recently been searching for dental forums in hopes that someone out there, might have some clue or advice as to what I could possibly do...\n\n\n\nThank you very much, If you took the time to read this, I really do appreciate it. mar_ok: bump. still seeking advice on this, the problem continues to worsen. mar_ok: bump - still seeking advice on this.........."

    "dialogue": "marty50s: I had a permanent bridge done, which required to do a crown on a healthy cuspid that never had a problem (I'm 57).  The crown preparation -- despite the anesthesia -- was very painful.  Now, two months later, I have the following problems:\n\n1.  The bridge gives me two types of pain: a dull pain which I cannot tell whether is in the gum or the cuspid and a gum pain around the other crown on a molar.  There is no sensitivity to cold / hot temperatures.\n\n2. The bridge's pontics and crowns are larger than my natural teeth and larger than the ones of other two bridges I have.  These two bridges are the same size than my natural teeth and have plenty of space for the threader floss to pass through.  The new bridge is bigger and pushes against the gum leaving a tight space for the threader floss to pass through, which at times it hurts.\n\nMy dentist told me that the pontics/crowns for the new bridge were made larger by the lab to fill the space between the gum and the lower teeth for proper occlusion.  However, I never noticed before the space between the gums on one side was larger than the other side and I never had an occlusion problem with my natural teeth or later with a partial bridge.  Could be that the pain is the result of the pontics / crowns being too large?  If so, could the bridge be replaced?"

    "dialogue": "um311: I was fitted for a crown a couple of weeks ago, and gradually started to develop jaw pain that has increased in frequency and intensity (every 6 hours or so is another sharp pain).  It has woken me up in the middle of the night, to which ibuprofen and an ice pack can usually do the trick to relieve the pain and get me back to sleep within 20-30 minutes, but it has been an annoying occurrence since it happens throughout the day as well. I attribute it to original procedure as the dentist and team kept pointing out I have a small mouth and had to keep it open for a couple hours during the procedure.  They also indicated the anasthetic injections are neuromuscular and that can trigger jaw pain as well.\n\n I went back to the dentist to get the crown placed in, only to realize that the original crown did not fit and so I had to go through the same procedure all over again much to my dismay.  I patiently sat through it though, because I didn't have a choice and they were already well underway.  I'm just concerned that my jaw pain was getting worse before today, and then I had to go through the same procedure that triggered the pain in the first place while it was already pretty sore.  The team suggested I continue with a higher dose of ibupforen, salt water rinses, and cold water packs around the jaw.  I'm pretty frustrated though and in a lot of pain.  Now I have to go back yet again in a few weeks and hope the crown works the next go-round.  Otherwise, this keeps triggering the pain over and over.  Any advice?"

A few days ago a spot on the front of the gums of my lower set of teeth started hurting, and about a day later I noticed a large white spot (which I assumed was/is a canker sore). It has been a couple of days since I noticed it and the pain is awful. I haven't tried treating it until today (I rinsed with salt water and applied \"Canker - X to the spot\"). Because the spot is against my lower lip, I have found it difficult to keep the gel on the sore. This has caused very great discomfort. It hurts to talk, laugh or move my lower lip. Also, the area of my jaw that the sore is on is slightly sore. Is this normal? There is just the one sore. However, I am very neurotic and have been looking up oral cancer images and symptoms. I know I am being hasty and probably making myself unnecessarily upset, but could anyone offer some insight/tips on how to successfully treat this? Should I see a dentist and if so, how long should I wait before I do this? How much time should I allow the sore to heal on its own with just me treating it?\n\nThank you so much for your time.

Within about 8 months, the rebuilding job started crumbling. He rebuilt it again. Both times, I was almost certain that I probably needed a crown there.\n\nI experienced lots of pain in his second rebuild job. For two or three days afterward, the area was sensitive. The pain finally went away, but things never felt really normal there.\n\nWithin about 3 months, I awoke one morning with lots of pain there. The kind of pain that comes with an abscess. Time to go to another dentist.\n\nDentist #2 recommended a crown, which was a good idea. She said there was a lot of decay that was deeper than normal, but that she got it all. Crown fit perfectly -- both the temp and the permanent.\n\nI could eat normally. Everything was fine. It hadn't felt this good in a long time. About three days later, I started having what I would describe as fever in that area. Warm to the touch, but still had no pain and could eat normally. I took Tylenol twice a day for two days, and it finally all went away.\n\nYesterday morning, I woke up with the beginning of a sinus infection.  Dosed up on the meds, drank a lot of hot coffee and tea, gargled, and knocked it out.  But last night, I started getting a slight pulsing sensation in the area of that tooth.  No pain. Not throbbing like an abscess. Just a pulse that comes and goes.  Like I said, not painful.\n\nI'm sure that because of the condition of the tooth and the work that Dentist #2 had to do that there was probably some trauma there in her getting things ready to receive the crown. I'm wondering if all of these little mild signs are just the tooth repositioning and reseating and if the sinus attack has something to do with this now?  If it persists for several days -- pain or not -- I will go back and check with her.\n\nAny ideas?"

And ive booked a dentist appointment but its due on the 19th of August..... As much as I hate the dentist I want to see a dentist sooner (my dentist is on holiday) really appreciate any help you can give me ThirdStreetDental: This answer is a little late and I hope by now you've seen your dentist. It sounds like simple cavities that can be quickly fixed with fillings. X-rays will be able to determine the number of fillings necessary. Your teeth aren't likely to fall out at the age of 15 unless it's due to an injury. The dentist is never as bad as you build it up to be in your mind. A root canal doesn't seem likely either. Dental implants are a viable option when a tooth is lost as they can last a lifetime and actually fuse with the jaw bone. They are identical to your original teeth. Unless you actually lost a tooth you wouldn't be a candidate for this. I always recommend that patients, particularly those who do not like fingers in their mouth and have dental anxiety, bring an iPod and listen to music to calm themselves down and distract from the procedure. Good luck."

    "dialogue": "Katya: On Thurs July 11 I was having two contiguous crowns replaced, the two lower molars, the farthest back.\n\nAs they were fitting the temporaries, there was a lot of interference when I bit, and I remembered that I \"always\" have a lot of problems with interference.  I.e., they always have to spend a huge amount of time removing material due to interference.  Twice I've been sent home because they did not believe me, and then I had to go back to have more material removed.\n\nSo I told this to the assistant and she said it would be fine because I had bitten down all the way.  I told her \"no I hadn't\" because she didn't tell me to do that.  She just pressed my jaw together the way she wanted.  She remarked that maybe I have a cross bite.\n\nThey were unable to remove enough material from the temporaries for me to be able to chew comfortably.  Dentist said that if he removed more, the temporaries could break.\n\nRepeatedly through all the procedure all this,  I asked, Are you sure that the molds for the permanent crowns will be OK?  And they (assistant and dentist) repeatedly told me Yes.\n\nWhen I called the next day, to let them know that I couldn't chew properly, they said \"come in today\" and they will make a new mold and new temporaries so that I could chew.  I couldn't come then and scheduled for Monday. Then on Monday I called to cancel, because I was just too busy to get away, that I'd found a way to chew adequately that would suffice and could handle it til getting my permanents in just a few days (Thurs July 18).\n\nOn Wed July 17, the day before the appt for the permanents, they called and said they had to reschedule til Thurs July 25 because the lab wasn't done with the the permanent crowns.  \n\nThen they called me on Tuesday July 23 and said that the lab said that the crowns wouldn't be ready until Tuesday August 6.  They could not say why the additional delay.  They asked me if I'd like to come in again to remove more material from the temporaries.  I felt as though something fishy was up, and said  I'd \"call them back on that\". \n\nIt is not easy for me to get away from work.  I am working 14 hour days right now and am intensely busy.  I have almost no income, am on food stamps, and must complete my new website in order to get my income flowing again.  It's a longish drive to the dentist.  So I do not want to drive in simply to fix the temporaries.  \n\nHowever, if they told me that they needed a new mold for the permanents, of course I'd find a way to go in.  Because of course I want them to work well.\n\nIs it reasonable to suppose that what normally takes a lab one week to do was delayed first for ONE week and then for an additional TWO weeks, all due to some unnamed issue with the lab?\n\nIs it possible that the dental office is not being straight with me?  That the lab is not holding them up?  That they are trying to get me to come back for a new mold for the permanent crowns, but do not want to admit that they need me to do that?  Are they worried about this because of the fact that I asked them repeatedly on July 11 whether the permanent molds needed to be redone, since clearly the temporaries would not working?\n\nIf it's possible that the lab could have some unnamed delay, then I can relax.  Otherwise I feel intensely uncomfortable with the integrity of this dentist office. If they made a mistake with the way they took the molds, they should admit it and ask me to come in to fix it.  I would do that.\n\nThe other piece of this story is that I am paying for this out of pocket.  When I appeared for my July 11 appt, they told me that the Careington dental discount plan that they had recommended and given me a quote on DID NOT COVER THIS TREATMENT.  But they were very nice about it.  They were able to confirm that I received a written bid for them (for about $1850) for the treatment under the Careington plan, and they honored the bid.  So they ate about $600.  All very honorable. \n\nSo I am very  perplexed.  Would really appreciate feedback."

    "dialogue": "Catt: Hello, am new here... i've looked around and have not seen my exact problem, so am starting a new topic. Please forgive me if i am duplicating, but i could not find another thread with this exact issue.\n\nHad difficult extraction 11 days ago; lower right molar - #31. It had broken all the way down to the bone, after a root canal, so regular dentist sent me to dental surgeon for extraction. He did have to torque on it quite a bit, and cut it into pieces, (apparently there was an extra root), but it finally came out.\n\nHealing seemed to be going well, no dry socket, and gradual reduction in pain in the socket area itself.  \n\nBut I was surprised to find that after 8-9 days, there was still some pain in the jaw, continuing up towards the ear, that was not going away.  \n\nThen yesterday - 10 days after extraction - I woke up to sudden and SEVERE vertigo - so bad it knocked me down. This has continued since; every time I either stand up or lie down. \n\nReturned to dental surgeon today thinking perhaps I had an infection affecting my inner ear and equilibrium (as this happened to me once before, & went to many doctors before it was discovered the vertigo was from a bad infected tooth) but he said there is NO infection, and the ongoing pain and vertigo is due to food getting stuck down in the hole/socket.  He irrigated it - hurt like h*** -  and told me further irrigation at home will keep it clean, and that will stop the pain AND the vertigo.\n\nso my questions are:\n\nShould simple irrigation with water hurt THAT much? (when he irrigated it, and every time I irrigate it at home, it REALLY hurts, way down in there at the bone.)  Is that much pain almost two weeks after surgery within normal recovery parameters? \n\nWhat could be causing this sudden onset of extreme vertigo almost two weeks after the extraction,  if NOT an infection?  Will keeping food out of the socket REALLY cause the vertigo to stop?\n\nthanks so much for any insight -"

    "dialogue": "Memeroses: I had to my cavities filled and root canal crowned by the end of may because that's when my insurance ended, so I called and told them that and they got me in and said that they could do my cavity fillings the same day that they did my crown for my root canal tooth and that the out of pocket charge would be 2,100 that had to be paid at the appointment. They emailed me the morning of my apt. and said they underestimated me by $500. My mother was paying for my work, so when I was in the chair being numbed and the receptionist told her about the price she asked about possibly just doing the crown and not the fillings. The receptionist then came back into the exam room and announced, \"You need to come out here and talk to your mother about what we are doing today!\" So I go back, and we decide to just do the crown and I get back in the chair. Meanwhile apparently the receptionist made a comment about how the doctor had blocked out a huge time slot for me that he would now waste, so my mother says fine and the receptionist interrupts the dentist a second time and says go ahead with everything. The dentist then says, \"There are people not in this room that are irritating me and making things more difficult than they need to be. Don't worry, we will will persevere and I will do good work.\" Whether he was talking about my mother or the receptionist I am not sure, but still wtf.\n  And then the entire time he was working out my mouth I got the feeling that he was being extra rough because he was in a bad mood. For example, they usually put cotton or something to hold your cheeks and lips away from your teeth while they are working and he didn't, instead of holding my bottom lip away from my mouth he put his drilling instrument on top of it with my lip folded in, so my lip was pressed down sandwiched between my teeth and his metal drill. The root canal crown was on one of my back molars and the cavities were on my bottom and top very last molars on each side. He didn't hold my cheeks open with anything and the whole time his drill was 1/6 of an inch from my flesh. I was terrified to move or swallow. One time I did exhale and his tool did hit my flesh. After two or so hours he said, \"we'll wrap up for today, you look like you are having fun. I can appreciate your eye rolls.\" I never rolled my eyes at him. My entire face was numb and I couldn't have rolled my eyes if I had wanted to. He left and his assistant finished up molding my temporary crown and he never came back, no follow up advice or anything. \n  My crown came off the next day in one piece, I went back in and his assistant did the re-cementing and said my gum tissue had been lodged under the crown forcing it to not adhere right. I leave, it comes off again the next day while I am eating a wrap and I don't even feel it and bite down on it and break it. I haven't gone back and now that my insurance is gone I cannot afford to go to a new dentist. Is this normal? Is it really that hard to get a crown on right and was he as unprofessional as I think he was? \n  Aside from all of that, disputing finances is never a great experience and I take responsibility for not knowing what we should have gotten done ahead of time but still, if you are annoyed with a patient should you really make it obvious? I felt like their attitude was sort of, \"Ugh these stupid poor people and their not being able to shell out thousands of dollars in one visit, she clearly won't spend much money with us so let's just rush through this.\" Memeroses: P.s. Sorry for the length danielhermann: These things keep happening. But I am sure that from next time you will not go to that dentist. It is time for you to find a new dentist."

I just saw a dentist, who was a little pricey, but got great reviews. I saw the dentist and hygienist separately in the office, about a week apart. The dentist took about 100 digital x-rays, and I had no cavities. I just returned from the hygienist, thinking that I must have gingivitis, but she told me my, that my dental care was great. My gums had receded some, between a 2 & 3, from her diagnostic tool. She told me, that my numbers, were low, where a five would indicate trouble. She told me the pain that I had pain in my back molar, because even though the gum hadn't receded badly, my nerve was randomly large there. My mom lost her teeth, at around my age, from periodontal disease, and my brother had a bad scare also. The hygienist said that my swollen, and painful gums were probably from a food that irritates them. Also, a couple of months ago, I burned my tongue, and ended up wt thrush. The dentist unfortunately did not give me, a script to take care of this. Who should I see, to take care of the thrush, and could it be causing my inside gums to feel inflamed. Also how long will it take, before my teeth, and gums, to start to feel, at least pre cleaning well? Also besides using dentin, is there any other way to calm down that nerve?

Went to dentist and he said possible relation to my nearby tooth that was dead awaiting root canal, currently with a large temp filling. Couple days later I started antibiotics and a wk later the lump had reduced by a third. Dentist said I may have to go oral surgeon because it did look a little sinister. However he said fact antibiotic reduced its size was good. Soon after went to an oral surgeon who sent me for scans. When I returned he said the pictures were not great and that there was no definitive obvious cause for lump. He did a biopsy that day, also by now lump was almost gone but had a obvious area still with a white patch and punched line around which he wasn't concerned about. After the biopsy he said the tissue he removed was very soft and not like cancer tissue that is normally hard. He sent for another scan which did show evidence of a pathway from tooth to area of biopsy. He says he 99% sure nothing serious. Couple days later the small white patch has re appeared with red around. When I asked before he said maybe salivary calcification? I am FREAKING OUT. What are chances of something serious?

My last dentist visit was when I was in my mid-teens (maybe 15?). \n\nI really don't remember much about what the dentist is like. I've never dealt with paying for it. \n\nMy teeth have served me well. They look pretty good. Gums seem strong and are not over-sensitive. \n\nMy oral care is moderately good. I floss once or twice per week. I brush 2-3 times per day. For the last several years I've used an electric Sonicare brush. I also use a Waterpik filled with 50% Listerene solution every morning (sometimes 2-3 times per day). \n\nMy gums are healthy compared to what I've been reading from others here. They have good color and rarely bleed when I floss. They aren't overly tender. \n\nMy one gum issue is from dipping tobacco for 20+ years. The gum around the canine and first premolar on one side on the bottom has receded from tobacco use. It doesn't cause any issues, but it is obviously not right when I compare the two sides (I always use tobacco on the same side). \n\nI have a couple issues that I want to get repaired before I have an emergency, and I just need to go because I'm long overdue.\n\nI have a large cavity visible in the back molar on the lower right side. The grooves in the top of the molar are black. I think it may be an old filling that fell out. I noticed the large cavity when I was inspecting my teeth a couple months ago and it has really been worrying me. I'm sure it will cause me pain sometime soon. I also have tiny light-brown spots on several teeth that I suspect are the early signs of a cavity. \n\nI have had a good-paying (~$50k) job with dental coverage for about three years now. I've been putting off a dentist visit because I didn't want to have an insurance claim with a new job. I wasn't sure if it would effect my employer's view of me. I'm now well established at my job and just need to go to the dentist. \n\nMy insurance pays 100% \"preventative\" care, 90% \"basic\" care, and 60% \"major\" care. There is a $1000 annual maximum. I can afford to pay $500-$1000 out-of-pocket right now. \n\nMy biggest worry is cost and managing what I spend. Is there a person at a dentist office who will be able to discuss how to treat any problems I may have? I'll probably need to prioritize my treatment and take care of issues over a few years. Will the doctor fight me on this?\n\nIs there any buyer-beware advice? Are there dentist up-sell techniques I should avoid? \n\nHow much care does $1500 buy, if I need major care (as defined by my insurance) what will it cost? Is there a reference somewhere to learn what different procedures should cost? \n\nIs there a possibility that having a cleaning while I have that big cavity could cause the issue to become an urgent need? Right now it doesn't cause me any pain. My worry is that the Hygienist could damage the tooth. \n\nAny advice is welcome. The thought of visiting the dentist is causing me more fear than a 40 year old man should be feeling. I'm worried about being an uninformed consumer, coming up with the money, and just worried about the thought of having someone poke around in my mouth. I don't mean any offense to any professionals, but it is scary for someone who hasn't been to a doctor before. \n\nThanks you for any guidance or feedback you can provide.\n\nRegards,\nJeff danielhermann: According to your problems, they may effect your oral health.\nTobacco, smoking or drinking effect oral health badly. Hope you may overcome of this habit.\nPlease try to overcome the problem of fearing form dentist. They will not eat you.\n\nYou should see a dentist that will help you to take a decision regarding your oral heath."

I also chew ice cream which means my teeth are screaming even more.. I'm pretty sure teeth are somewhat sensitive to very cold or hot food or drink, it's just I notice it much more where my filling is in my molar while the ice cream is touching it, but as soon as I swallow it goes back to feeling normal. My filling is white and as I don't eat ice cream that often it doesn't feel sensitive that often. \nSometimes I will have off days where it is more sensitive but most of the time it's just like my other teeth (other than when eating ice cream!).

It's not painful or a burden on my life, I just started worrying that maybe it's worse than I think it is? Maybe it needs doing.. again?! Every time I go to the dentist he says my teeth are fine. \nIs what's happening normal or am I right to be worried? I'm thinking of seeing my dentist but I don't really want to have to have the filling re-done again. I can just imagine this going on forever!"

He has referred me to an oral surgeon to perform the extraction.\n\nMeanwhile, my dentist wants to fill these cavities (not on the wisdom teeth).  It is pretty bad and it will require 3 separate sessions.  He wants to do this before the oral surgery.\n\nMy question, does this make sense?  Some of the worst cavities look to be between the wisdom teeth and the last molar.  Logic seems to say that it would be easier after the extraction.  When I questioned him he said that it would not be difficult to get at before the extraction and that he wanted to do 1st because he was worried about the recovery time delay after the extraction.\n\nA number of people (non-dentists) have questioned his logic when I mention it.  I have a great relationship with my dentist, but my spider-sense is tingling that this is more about getting the $$ than about what is best for me.\n\nThank you for your time."

It was in good condition before the wisdom tooth extraction. I went to dentist today and he told me that it has to be removed. Also the one on the top has to be removed too. He said he can't do bridges to the bottom second molar because I don't have any support next to it. That is why he is suggesting to remove the affected bottom second molar and the healthy top molar.

    "title": "Teeth are making me severely depressed (long story)",
    "dialogue": "sad: I have a bad history with the dentist. My parents never taught me how to brush my teeth as a little kid and they refused to take me to the dentist unless I needed a tooth pulled, which happened twice- the first time was a severely infected baby molar and the second was an adult molar (#3) that chipped when I was only 11 years old (they didn't do anything about it until I was 17 or 18- and elected to have it pulled instead of RC'd).\n\nDuring my teens I got a mouth full of amalgam and some composite fillings. I was really clueless during this time, these were my first times to the dentist besides when I had my infected child tooth pulled. I implicitly trusted whatever the dentist did, or rather obliviously. Then one day, one dentist had to drill a hole in the side of molar number 19 to put in a filling. Well, he didn't. He drilled the hole and either put no filling, or the filling fell out.\n\nI went home and brushed my teeth and got the worst kind of pain. I looked in the mirror and was shocked to see this perfectly smooth, drilled hole in the molar. We immediately called the dentist and he denied everything, but told me to come back in the next day.\n\nI did, and he refilled the tooth, free of charge (but still denied everything).\n\nEventually, bit by bit, the filling fell out again. I didn't realize this as food or spit would impact the tooth and make the side of the tooth smooth most of the time. It sounds silly, but it was easy to miss as my tongue rarely went there and it looked the same in the mirror. Basically, long story short is that the filling fell out completely and decay got under the tooth.\n\nI finally went back to the dentist recently, a dental clinic. I'm in my 20s now, but currently unemployed and getting some help from my family. The dentist said I needed 5 of my fillings redone, 2 new fillings (one very tiny) and that horrible hole filled.\n\nShe filled the whole about a half a day ago with amalgam. I asked her if composite would be better and she insisted amalgam lasts longer and that it was going to be a bigger filling.\n\nHalfway through the drilling, she told me it was very deep and that it was very close to the pulp, and that she was going to fill it but that I'd eventually need a root canal. I've read tons of horror stories about root canals, that basically the tooth is eventually lost. I'm afraid this is going to happen to most of my teeth, as I have some large fillings on other molars.\n\nI have severe anxiety around this issue. I have OCD and anxiety issues which cause bouts of depression, and when the dentist told me this halfway through the drilling, it triggered the anxiety in the worst way.\n\nWhen I got home I wanted to kill myself (again). I don't mean that figuratively, I was thinking of how I was going to go about killing myself. The last time I went through this was in September and it last about 10-12 days. I lose my appetite and can barely move my body. My body literally hurts from the tension. My vision is hazy. I barely have any money and even if I get a job and save up, the best a dentist can do is eventually kill all of my teeth and then eventually those will fail and I'll need dentures (since a mouth full of implants would be tens of thousands of dollars).\n\nIt just feels so hopeless. I was reading about laser treatment for healing pulp and pulp caps and how they can be done instead of root canals. So far I don't need a root canal and I have no major infections, and the only thing that calms my anxiety is the hope that I can eventually do procedures to rebuild dentin and hold on to my living teeth for an extra 10-15 years or more. I'm not even 30 and I'm picturing extreme pain and fake teeth in my near future.\n\nI've been brushing and flossing and using fluoride for the past 4 years. I've been taking better care of my teeth. I wish I did when I was younger. But it feels like it's too late. mistermeow: I am sorry you are sad.  I would approach the situation with the most logic you can, in a slow manner.  When you are anxious, thoughts are fast and irrational.\n\nI think your first priority should be comfort.  You want to keep your mouth comfortable.  Second, you want to be healthy.  You are brushing and flossing, but you can also add rinsing with listerine to your routine.  \n\nFor your dental work, if you can borrow money from family, then maybe get one problem taken care of every month, or every 3 months, whatever you can do.  If you do all you can do for your health now, then you will have the best results you can get.\n\nThe best results may or may not be what you want, but you do not know what will happen for sure in the future, so just keep going one month at a time.\n\nI was missing most of my adult teeth, and was lucky enough to have my parents get me dental work for the top of my mouth when I was a teen.  I was never able to get my bottom teeth fixed, and it has always been mostly gaps, (4 adult teeth in the very back, and a few small ones in front, which are all gone now but one).\n\nSo you are not alone in having dental problems.  So do not feel bad! sad: thanks meow. I'm trying to take it one step at a time. It's tough because my entire family is in debt one way or the other. I don't have any rich relatives. Any money I've earned recently has been to help my immediate family out with food and stuff.\n\nThe worst part of it all is the uncertainty. Uncertain if my dentist is making the right decisions (or any dentist, since some seem to be scam artists and some are legit). Uncertain if I will wake up in throbbing pain in a tooth and not have money for a root canal. Uncertain if most of my molars will need to be pulled by this time next year. I guess that's life- uncertainty. But unlike cancer or a car crash or something more serious and out of my control, rarely anyone has sympathy for people with teeth trouble. They scold them, laugh at them, and generally don't care even though they have to live in pain, discomfort, misery and shame and struggle just to keep teeth to chew with. It just makes me feel even more isolated and my OCD truly makes everything worse.\n\nI'm not trying to say losing teeth is anywhere near as serious as those things, by the way. It's just more serious than people think, since most people don't have to deal with it."

    "dialogue": "ChrisSF: I struggled with bulimia for about a decade, and as a result my teeth were in horrible condition and even falling out. My boyfriend referred me to his dentist who also specializes in cosmetic dentistry. I didn't have the $50K to get all the work done in one go, but he assured me that wasn't going to be an issue and I could get whatever work done now that I desired. We established a plan, including a regimen of prescription mouthwash and toothpaste to reduce the bacterial load in my mouth. Of course I wanted the teeth in front to be done first since that is what is visible to other people and I hadn't really smiled in ten years.\n\nAfter a few months of excruciating dental work (root canals on nearly all my teeth) and lots of painkillers I was happy with the results. The teeth looked great and I couldn't even believe they were mine. I no longer had to suffer from abscessed teeth and debilitating pain. I haven't been able to afford to get the teeth in the back parts of my mouth done yet, but they're almost all still there.\n\nSince I had the work done I've had repeated problems with the teeth on the top. Two of them came off while I was eating, and one of these crowns I swallowed. This all despite the fact that I've stuck to old habits and have been extremely careful about what I eat and how I chew, namely chewing on my back teeth as much as possible (despite my dentist sarcastically saying I could chew on rocks because these porcelain crowns are so strong). Since then he has lasered my gums twice, because on two of them he decided to use the old teeth to post my crowns without asking me first, and those broke (one was extremely painful), and had to use the laser when he redid the work by making his own posts. There was one time I overheard him and his assistant talking about how they used the wrong cement on one of my teeth. Now I permanently have two long teeth on the top because he took a laser to my gums and the first time he used the laser was to make my gums symmetrical, which they clearly aren't anymore. He said this wouldn't be an issue because when I smile the tops of my teeth aren't visible anyway.\n\nTwo days ago was when I swallowed one of my crowns. Every time I've had an issue with my upper teeth he says its because I need to get the posterior teeth done so all my teeth will be strong. I only started having this work done a year ago, and initially he said getting the rest of the work done over the course of a few years would be fine. Now he's pressuring me every time I see him to get the other work done. This amounts to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nHe talks about things like bite force, saying all the pressure is being put on my front teeth despite me knowing and having told him that I primarily use my back teeth to chew food. I mostly eat soft foods anyway, just because I don't want to risk breaking any crowns. He is not a cheap dentist, and paying this kind of money I feel the quality of work should be top notch from the start. He says I'm biting at weird angles and that's why the crowns aren't staying in. I have a night guard that I use every night because he said that would help my teeth set and be stronger, but it doesn't seem to have much of an effect.\n\nThe weird thing is the bottom teeth have never had issues. It's only the top ones, and each time he talks about \"re-engineering\" something and it makes me extremely nervous that he's using my mouth as a laboratory experiment where he isn't sure about anything. I was under the impression this kind of cosmetic dentistry should have a straight forward procedure. Are the problems with my front upper teeth really a result of not having thousands of dollars worth of porcelain crowns on my posterior teeth, or is he just trying to cover up for his own mistakes? Bertram Boniface: Dental work that is properly planned and done well does not fail in a short space of time - within one year.\nReally good dental work should last in excess of twenty years.\nReally good dental work is rare.\n\nTreating cases like yours where there are serious problems cannot generally be done in 'bits' as appears to be what has happened in your case.\n\nUsually, after exhaustive records taking and treatment planning, a full mouth mock up is done in wax on cast models of your teeth on an instrument known as an adjustable articulator. All the teeth to be restored are then prepared and this mock up tested in the mouth (for function and appearance) using high quality laboratory fabricated acrylic provisional crowns. Only when everything has been shown to work well are the provisional crowns replaced with the final porcelain restorations.\nThis does not seem to have happened in your case.\n\nAll too often this sort of piecemeal approach (without proper planning) leads to loss of control, problems, fractures and failure. More treatment is then prescribed which only serves to precipitate yet more failure. The result is a vicious spiral of more and more treatment, more and more cost and more and more failure. You are starting on this path. Stop before it is too late and question what is going on.\n\nThe fact that your dentist has just used the same laser to destroy the symmetry he first created with it, should tell you a lot. It's curious how the gum symmetry which was important at the beginning is now \"not important because the tops of your teeth are not visible anyway\".\n\nThe fact that he is pressuring you to have more work done at the same time that the work you have already had done is falling apart should also tell you a lot.\n\nThe fact that he is now starting to blame you for his failure (weird biting angles and not having your back teeth crowned) should also tell you a lot.\n\nYou are right to be extremely nervous.\n\nThe kind of cosmetic dentistry you describe is anything but straightforward, it is difficult, complex and requires a great deal of skill and experience.\n\nGet your money back (the work you have had done is self evidently not fit for purpose and not of merchantable quality) and find someone competent and honest to make a new plan and do the work properly. Be prepared to start again. Do not throw good money after bad."

I have had a duel ache in a tooth for over two months.  I have been too 2 dentists and a endo doctor only to have them tell me that there is nothing wron that they can see on X-rays or trying to get the tooth to hurt with tests they preform.  So know over the weekend the pain is getting worse and I am having problems sleeping.  \n\nChewing on the tooth or hot and cold does not effect the tooth/make it hurt.  It is just a duel ache that gets worse at times on scale 1-10,10 being the worse when it really hurts it would be a 5-6.  The endo does not know if a root canel is needed as again all the test he has done has lead him to a good answer that there is a problem with the tooth.  I am just trying to figure out what else it can be as I'm at my wits end with this.  \n\nI have a apointment tomorrow afternoon to see the endo.

No pain again until recently, I don't what it is, the extraction sites look white and tender and there is a little bleeding on one of them.  \n\nMost of my teeth will just start to hurt for no reason and I'm not exactly sure where to pinpoint the pain, and I am a light smoker and yes it does seem to happen not to long after I smoke so I haven't smoked yet today.

The stimulants are amphetamines which are generally really strong stimulants.\n\nWhen I hit adulthood, I unfortunately never grew out of ADHD and was accordingly treated with higher doses according to age and odymass. The increase in the medication began to cause me to 'grit my teeth' unknowingly throughout the day.\n\nAs time went on, doses got stronger as my body got more tolerant to the medication but the gritting got worse and bruxism began at night (started around age 17-18).\n\nI started to use nightguards which worked to an extent, but every 2 months or so I'd chew through them in my sleep!\n\nThe downside is that the ADHD specialists weren't able to do anything about this but remove me from medication impacting my school / work life.\n\nOver the years (I'm now 33), the roots on all 8 back molars (top and bottom) began to resorb.

    "title": "Root Canal/Crown or Extraction?",
    "dialogue": "mrgossett: When I went to my dentist last week for my regular six-month check-up and cleaning, the hygienist found an area of decay under the gum line on my upper second molar. I had noticed some periodic tenderness when I brushed that area, but I thought it was just an irritated gum. After the decay was found, an x-ray was taken of the tooth (which took three tries because of the difficulty of getting a good view of the tooth). The x-ray showed quite a lot of decay inside the tooth, but there is no decay on the outside. My dentist said that is pretty rare, but can happen due to bacteria getting inside the tooth. I have always taken good care of my teeth, and the others are in good shape, so I'm really surprised and upset that this has happened. Previous x-rays didn't show any problem with this tooth, so this must be something that has developed pretty quickly. The options I was given were 1) Do nothing for now (I don't want to do this) 2) Do root canal and a crown, which would cost maybe $2500 total and require several appointments; or 3) tooth extraction. The affected tooth is above a bottom molar that has never come in fully, and the two teeth don't meet for much chewing. I also had an impacted wisdom tooth removed behind that area years ago, and that area will always be tender. Bottom line is that I can't and don't chew much directly on those back teeth on that side. I really hate to lose that tooth, but I'm also reluctant to start down that root canal/crown road with the expense (I don't have dental insurance) and the possibility of trouble with it later. So I'm on the fence and having a hard time deciding what to do. The tooth is not causing me much discomfort yet. Any thoughts, advice, or experiences would be appreciated. Thanks! Erin: I would recommend you to turn to one more specialist for consultation at least. But before doing that check chosen ones, I mean read dentist reviews and complaints, for example, on pissedconsumer website, dental care section to make the right choice. The oppinion of several dentists will insure making the right decision. Bert: I recommend you get a second opinion on the situation of the tooth. It is strange that the dentist would give you the option of doing nothing about it if it is such a drastic case. A second opinion will help you take a decision.\n\n\nbest of luck,\nBert"

But I am in really high amounts of pain and the medication is not helping much. I have antibiotics for the infection, but what should I do? Alinajones: Some amount of pain and discomfort is expected for few days after tooth extraction. Amount of pain which occurs after tooth extraction is dependent on procedure which is used for the extraction of the tooth and the degree of trauma to the adjacent tissues.Pain can be managed after tooth extraction withover the counter pain medicaments.Analgesics are given after the tooth extraction to relieve the pain.During the first 24 hours after tooth extraction, you should take soft and liquid diet and should avoid taking food from the side where tooth was extracted. It is advised to do warm saline rinses 24 hours after the tooth extraction to reduce the pain and swelling. Take rest.You should avoid spitting, sucking, drinking anything with straw for minimum of 24 hours after tooth extraction and should not smoke for minimum of 2 days after tooth extraction.Smoking can create negative pressure and can cause dislodgement of clot and lead to dry socket."

    "dialogue": "TDDMS31: Good day all,\n\n10 years ago, my lower right molar had cracked, I went to the dentist and he filled it. At that time he told me that I would experience some tingling because he had killed the nerve. He went on to say that it will be common for me to experience coldness or sensitivity in that area for the rest of my life in that area.\n\nDuring the following decade, it was common every 8 months or so I would get a swelling in that area. I didn't think much of it at the time. Now fast forward 10 years, my new dentist did a basic exam and said that molar needs work because the color of it was black. When he removed the old filling he had found a cotton ball underneath the filling.\n\nSo after all these years, I finally found out what was causing all the problems.\n\nUltimately, he recommended a root canal, a build up, and a crown to save that molar. I tried saving money, but the tooth was falling apart and I finally got it removed. After the last visit, he recommended a regular cleaning, bitewings, removal of a wisdom tooth (that isn't causing any problems) and another evaluation. And every time I've gone in there, they have taken X-rays of my teeth, whether in groups or a panoramic. And now, he suggested that \"we need to do something about that minor over bite.\" But I distinctly remember him telling my 2 years ago that the over bite isn't a problem. I will ask him next time I see him why the change in opinion.\n\nThe reader should keep in mind a few things about my last sentence, in that I'm 33. I've played saxophone for 24 years. And I say this because every saxophonist I know doesn't have a perfect bite or even close to it.\n\nI agree with him about regular cleanings. But many of his other suggestions come across as unneeded. And the reader should keep in mind when replying or reading my above post that I have become SUPER skeptical when ever ANY doctor recommends something because of someone leaving a cotton ball in my molar.\n\nSo does any of this sound unnecessary? \n\nI look forward to reading responses.\n\nThanks and take care.\n\nTDDMS31"

Usually I changed because I moved or insurance has changed. The different dentists have pointed out that my teeth show signs of wear. This is definitely true. My top front 6 and bottom 6 teeth have definitely been filed down flat. \n\nAt first I was told that I grind my teeth at night and I needed to buy a night guard. Then with another dentist I was told it wasn't grinding, it was because of my bite pattern and I was wearing it down when I chew. So I needed some braces to change the bite pattern. The next dentist I had said it was grinding, and so on. It seems like they always are trying to sell me something and not fix me. I am just not confident in the assessments I am getting.\n\nThe fact that I have been told a few times it was grinding makes me wonder because when I was told it was my bite pattern it made more sense. My back teeth don't seem to be affected by the grinding as they are not ground down. My wife has never heard me grind my teeth at night and my jaw has never felt tight or uncomfortable in the morning. In fact, I have a deviated septum so I cant breathe through my nose when I sleep anyway so I usually sleep with my mouth open. This all made me think it was less grinding and more with my bite pattern. But when you think the dentists are just trying to upsell you something, like an add-on for your new car purchase, you don't feel confident in their opinion. Any thoughts on this, especially from dentists out there who don't have a financial interest in the outcome? VetTech2020: My opinion is that you should videotape yourself sleeping over a few days to determine if you are indeed grinding at night. Also, I would recommend being more aware of how you chew foods to determine if your teeth alignment is the issue. laurie_elmore27@yahoo.com: Dentists are usually pretty good at determining grinders because they see it so often.

The dentist didn't say much except that he did so many porcelain crowns so often in his office that he didn't realize I specifically asked for high noble, and then went on to say the crown was just as good and there was high noble underneath the porcelain and that to replace I would have to endure the procedure all over again etc...Basically leading into him getting me to agree that I didn't want to endure the drilling and temporary crown again but who would if they had the choice, the reason I requested high noble in the first place was in case I ever needed to have the crown replaced it would atleast have a little bit of return value.. I didn't know what to say, I am still dumfounded by the mistake and still can't believe there is no offer to fix the problem. The dentist's office hasn't returned my call since and I called requesting that it be fixed.\n\nAny help as how to approach the problem would be great. \n\nTo any dentist who read this, what would the proper procedure be in this situation for the Dentist?

There is some pain in the area of the procedure along with the headache is in my side of my forehead and also some pain that seems to radiate to the side of my neck.\n\nThe headache has become an almost constant feature in the last week or so. I was initially thinking it must be to do with the surgical wound still not fully healing, but now my suspicion is that there is some complication affecting my sinus that is causing this. My cold is almost completely gone now and except for a few occasional nasal blocks, I do not have any cold symptoms or sinus infection symptoms such as secretion from my nose etc. I am able to manage the headache with an Advil, but I am not happy with this temporary fix.

    "title": "Pain in tooth roots after a temporary bridge?",
    "dialogue": "jmr1068204: I had Invisalign for 2 years and it corrected a lot of issues with my teeth, closed gaps and fixed the problem with all of my top and bottom teeth slanting too far inward (which was causing me to bite my jaw frequently when talking and chewing). I was congenitally missing upper lateral incisors. I had been to an orthodontist who insisted that I needed a $50K surgery from his dental school buddy that he was trying to refer me to. I declined and went to a general dentist/implant dentist/cosmetic dentist. He is one of the best and well known in my city. My underbite wasn't that bad. So I had Invisalign for the 2 years and we basically moved the upper front teeth as close to the front of the gum as safely possible without causing any problems, and it was successful. After the 2 years of Invisalign, my dentist and I decided on a 6-unit fixed bridge. I was not a candidate for implants because the roots are basically in the way from the neighboring teeth on either side of the space that had grown into that spot and had to be moved back by the Invisalign.\n\nAbout 8 days ago, I had teeth 6, 8, 9 and 11 ground down, impressions taken, etc. to prepare for the bridge. My dentist made a temporary bridge within the same hour. I was told to not wear my top Invisalign tray and to only wear the bottom one, because the temporary bridge for the top would keep the teeth from moving back. I required something like a total of 9 or 10 shots total throughout the procedure, because I have really sensitive teeth for an unknown reason. One tooth in particular just wouldn't seem to numb all the way (tooth 6). I ended up going back to the dentist within a few days after that. I was having massive pain and basically all of the ground down teeth were hurting and my gums were burning as if I had an infection. Eating or drinking anything cold and sometimes slightly cooler than lukewarm water made my ground down teeth really sensitive, even though they were covered by the temp bridge. My bottom teeth also hurt from back to front on both sides, and it seems to be particularly when I wear the same Invisalign tray that I have been wearing for several weeks with no problem.\n\nWhen I went to my dentist about the pain after getting the teeth ground down, no infection was found. He saw nothing wrong. He removed the bridge, applied desensitizing gel and something else to the teeth and then reshaped and refitted the bridge and made a point that he was \"sealing every possible opening\". He gave me a prescription for 800mg Ibuprofen and that actually does help within an hour or two after taking it. But I seem to need it daily. It stops hurting until usually the next day, then either in the morning or afternoon of the next day, they are throbbing on the top and/or bottom. Are my teeth trying to move back on the top and hitting the bridge, causing the pain? But what about the bottom ones that we haven't touched at all and nothing has changed in weeks? My dentist couldn't tell me for sure why I was having pain. Even sitting in the dentist chair, as I told them (with my face numb up to my sinuses after having about 5 shots to remove the bridge and having put it back on for the second time with desensitizing)...I couldn't feel my upper lips and face. But the inside of my teeth...what felt like the roots, were killing me. This was after the desensitizing stuff and while I WAS numb seemingly everywhere but in the roots of the teeth.\n\nWhat is going on? Why are these teeth hurting? I'm puzzled about my bottom teeth. They hurt when I have my Invisalign tray in - and I have worn it religiously for like 4 weeks now and have continued it even after the temp bridge on top. Those bottom teeth can't be moving. There's no bleeding of the gums, etc. They look healthy. I can't stay on meds every day, but this is so puzzling. When I get my permanent bridge, I'm worried that I might still have pain and that can't be removed unless I buy a new bridge."

A mknth ago, he started complaining of tooth pain in the same area. I  immediately took him in to see a dentist (our usual was off for the month) andafetr an ray and exam, all she could see was a small scratch on is gums which she thought was the cause of his discomfort. She told me to bring him back in if the pain continued but he did not complain again. We have been in vacation for the past 2 weeks and he was complaining intermittently of pain in the area. I made him an app't for today as we got back last night. When he woke up this morning, his cheek was swollen. The dentist said that it couks be an infection in his gums or an abcess beneath the tooth that was filled. She took 2 rays which were inconclusive. The tooth did not hurt when she tapped on it but it is loose when she wiggles it and he said it hurt a bit when she was moving it. She said that if it is anabcess, the only option is to pull the tooth. She also said that sometimes a tooth can develop an abcess long after a filling and that it doesn't,mean the treating dentist did anything wrong.     She was reluctant to pull the tooth as she thought there might be a chance that the gums are infected (his 54/55 are very tight and food often gets caught between the teeth ans we often have to floss twice).  She has given him 10 days of antibiotics and told me to take him back in 2 weeks to reassess. Does this sound right or should I be taking him to a pediatric dental specialist?"

I can't really describe the pain but it was just like a sting of sorts and it throbbed for a bit. I brushed my teeth immediately to get rid of any chips particles that could possible be stuck and took a pain killer because it was already too dark outside to take a proper look at the tooth. This morning I woke up and the terrible pain of yesterday was gone but now there's this weird pressure-like feeling in my tooth. It doesn't hurt but it's still a little throbbish, more in an annoying way than painful.\n\nI've never had a cavity in my life. Nor have I ever had root canal treatments or anything like that. I go to a dentist twice a year for a check up, the last one was in May and nothing was wrong at all, he said my teeth looked perfectly fine. \n\nMy mum said that it's also possible that what I'm experiencing is an exposed tooth root.. but I've never had that before either so I have no idea if the pain I'm feeling is that.\n\nI've never really had any toothpain so I can't compare the feeling I'm having right now with any previous experiences.\n\nI hope anyone here can give me a little more insight as to what could possibly be wrong with me.

    "dialogue": "WannaBite: I have periodontal disease, which stems back to young adulthood. So, I've had lots of dental procedures done in the past to try to improve the health of my gums. I see my perio doc every 3-4 months. However, I currently have a problem with tooth 19 (lower molar tooth in the back of mouth). Two years ago, I was eating peanuts and experienced sharp pain with that tooth. My gums swole up, and I was presecribed an antiobiotic. After that, the tooth felt fine. My dentist recommended a root canal. I saw the endo doc, and he tested the tooth. Despite what the x-rays showed, the tooth was reactive to the cold test. Therefore, the endo doc said he couldn't do a root canal, and recommended I go back to my specialist. My dentist still asserted a root canal was needed. Long story short, a year passed and I did nothing about it. Fom time to time last year, my gum would swell up near the tooth and appear to be infected, so I'd get a prescrition for antibiotics to relieve it. This year, my perio doc sent me back to a different endo doc who said I did need the root canal. She tested the tooth, and it was not reactive this time. That makes me a good candidate for the root canal I guess. Here's the problem. The tooth for the past two years has had class II mobility, I think they say. At the end of the appointment with the endo doc, she said if she were me, she'd pull the tooth and get an implant. So, now I'm confused. I really had longed to save my tooth despite the mobility issue. It doesn't hurt, and it doesn't bother me normally. I try to be regular with cleanings, and just had a perio scaling and root planning done 2 months ago. My dentist said he's not sure if getting a root canal will save the tooth. The bone loss or infection beneath the tooth seems to be increasing. So, what's best? Try to save the tooth with a root canal, even if it's short-term, or get the implant, which is not covered by insurance? So, I'd have to plan it for next year and save for that. Is there a third option I haven't considered? I need to do something soon, and I need that tooth for eating solid foods. I can't just pull it and leave it unfilled. Any suggestions?"

I had never gone to this dentist before and it was my first visit to any dentist in several years.  Dentist told me I had 5 cavities - 3 on top and 2 on the bottom.  He said the 3 on top could be filled and the 2 on bottom would require root canals to fix.  I told him to proceed with the fillings on the top 3.\n\nWhen he was done with the 3, he told me that on one of them, the cavity was deep and that he could just start to see the pink from the nerve.  He said that the tooth may be sensitive for a little while.\n\nFor several weeks, the tooth was sensitive - hurt when I drank cold water and could not chew food on that side of my mouth.  Then, about 5 days ago, it started to really hurt.  First few days, it hurt for 5-10 minutes at a time, then would go away.  Finally, 2 days ago, the pain was really intense and I could not bear it unless I swished cold water around in my mouth to soothe the pain.\n\nCalled the dentist and he wrote a prescription for an antibiotic.  Took the antibiotic and also advil and the pain subsided.

Cavities can be more involved (advanced) than apparent on an x-ray. The likelyhood of the body repairing the tooth pulp in cases of advanced decay decreases significantly with age.  Seems like you have an irreversible pulpitis. The treatment plan appears sound. My recommendation is that you spend time to make sure your dentist explains things fully, and make sure you understand!!!!! Maya_siva: I too had the same problem with my tooth.Still am having two of mine undergone with RCT treatment.But unfortunately one of them had a failure.Now for last two years i am suffering from severe pain and the dentist told me to have a re-RCT session.Just be careful when you are going through this session."

    "dialogue": "Molly_Dog: I have lost nearly all of my teeth. I shattered two cervical vertebrae in a car accident in 1980 and over the next 3 years practically every tooth in my head abscessed and literally fell apart despite spending a small fortune at the dentist. I have Juvenile Onset Diabetes and was diagnosed in 1978. 5 years ago I was diagnosed with Stage III Renal Failure and Chronic Kidney Disease.\n\nOver the last 3 years the tissue my mouth and tongue (NOT my teeth) have become hyper-sensitive to even the smallest amount of spice in foods and beverages. I have always loved hot foods such as stuffed jalapenos, cayenne pepper, cerrano peppers, even the much-maligned habanero! Now even the carbonation in a soda causes severe pain.\n\nI brush my teeth, gums and tongue at least twice a day for a minimum of 3 minutes but even alcohol-free mouthwash (ACT or Crest ProHealth) is like rinsing my mouth with a Drano and lye cocktail. My dentist says it is gingivitis but every symptom I have read about gingivitis doesn't  match up with what I am experiencing. My gums are not swollen and they don't bleed and my breath is not bad. (Bad breath is one of my biggest turn-offs so I KNOW my breath isn't bad!) \n\nI occasionally have one or two white spots on my tongue that are approximately the size of a dime. They appear similar to \"Thrush\" photos I have seen but are also hyper-sensitive and usually go away after a day or two of brushing my tongue. They only appear if I slack off on brushing my tongue for a day.\n\nMy only \"vice\" is that I smoke a cigar a day or every other day. I quit cigarettes nearly 5 years ago. I do not chew my cigars nor do I inhale the smoke. I know the risks, believe me. My medical  team is aware of my cigars and as long as I don't start smoking dramatically more, they're grudgingly OK with it. My medical history has involved my being clinically dead 3 different times. I have fallen off a building, at age 6 I was shot in the abdomen at point blank range, I've been run over twice by cars, my blood sugar has been as high as 1300 and as low as 12, at 18 months I was stung by fire ants over 1000 times, the aforementioned broken neck and I've had a complete bowel obstruction that had me literally seconds away from a completely ruptured stomach. God has me here for a reason and, while I don't pretend to know His mind or His plan for me, I don't think 5 or 6 cigars a week is going to be the death of me. \n\nI've tried rinsing my mouth with warm salt water but I accidentally overdid it one time and it took forever for my mouth to recover. \n\nCan anyone shed some (or ANY?) light on my problem, please? Following my dentist's instructions to the letter for the last 6 months has not improved the hyper-sensitivity even one iota.\n\nThanks so much for any information/advice any of you can share!\nM_D"

    "dialogue": "KillTheCan: I know this is long but obviously details are important in these cases.I have some symptoms that have been making me nervous and am looking for input.\n\nFirst off let me tell you about myself, I’m in college and I have made some regrettable decisions but I am clean on all levels now and have been for almost a year. (no smoking, chewing, drugs, or anything like that). I smoked briefly for about 3 months and quit immediately. Then I did chewing tobacco for nearly two years (around once a day). After a friend got mouth cancer I quit all tobacco entirely (a year ago). I drink occasionally but not more then anyone else. My family does have a history of cancer and I have no remaining grandparents as a result.\n\nAbout a month ago a swollen lymph node on the left side of my neck got large and painful. About the same time I suffered from extreme exhaustion, itchiness, and night sweats. Upon some googling I became concerned I might have lymphoma. I went to the doctor, she did a blood test that came back normal, so she prescribed amoxicillin antibiotics. The lymph node returned back to normal in less then a week and I felt like new again. \n\nUntil a few days ago (it’s been a month since last time) I noticed the exact same lymph node is swollen. This time it does not hurt much but is a bit tender. I have no night sweats, no itchiness, and no fatigue. My doctor said since the antibiotics worked last time, this may all be due to some sort of infection my body failed to fight off last time. He suggested that the lymph node that was swelling is a filter for the bottom of the mouth. Immediately I became concerned about a possible mouth cancer situation for my chewing days. The doctor ended up prescribing more amoxicillin for a longer period. When I got home I examined my mouth as best I could and found a tiny tiny bump in my lower lip. It’s so small that I can feel it with my tounge, but it is very, very hard to see. Upon MORE GOOGLING I figured out this may just be a mucocele, or could it be a tumor? Could I have a cavity? Gingivitis? I am so lost in what could cause this. Even if the antibiotics work, I still want to know what the heck is going so this doesn’t keep recurring.\n\nShould I see another doctor? An ENT? A dentist? Does anyone know what would cause this? I don’t think it’s cancer because if it was, the antibiotics wouldn’t have worked last time would they? What kind of infection above the shoulders could cause these symptoms?\n\nAny experiences, input, advice, or knowledge is GREATLY appreciated. I think if I’m more educated on the topic, then I will be able to ask better questions when I see the doctor again next week. If people think it's a good idea, I may go see a dentist and/or an ENT also."

    "dialogue": "jmr1068204: 4 teeth (An upper cuspid on each side and both upper central incisors - all in very good shape and have been moved using 2 years of Invisalign) are to be filed down for a fixed bridge for congenitally missing lateral incisors. I presume that impressions are taken before the filing down and also after. A temporary bridge is typically made in an hour or two at the dentist office and temporarily glued into place and worn for 2-3 weeks until the permanent bridge comes back. A history of Invisalign has moved nearly every tooth considerably. All upper and lower teeth were originally slanted too far inward and have been pulled outward, about 5-6 teeth were extruded (pulled out to make them longer - including the 4 teeth to be filed down, which have had the most movement of any) . During this 2-3 week waiting period for the new bridge when no Invisalign trays can be worn due to the filing and temp bridge...how much will these other teeth move without a retainer? Yet a retainer has to wait on the permanent bridge to come back and yet more impressions have to be made to make the retainer that will fit once the bridge has been attached - yet another 2-3 weeks to get that, maybe? What method will keep these teeth from moving and altering to the point where they won't fit the new retainers when they do finally come back? Any ideas how my dentist will handle this one? I'll be asking him, of course. Just seeking other opinions.\n\nThe original plan was to do implants. Like we figured, Invisalign couldn't move the roots, and they're in the way. An ortho (who I saw before my cosmetic dentist) wouldn't put metal braces on. He wanted a $50K surgery, I had no insurance and most won't cover it anyway. The Invisalign did what the ortho and a former dentist said couldn't be done without surgery. \n\nI don't want anything removable. Is this my only best \"fixed\" option - a porcelain bonded to metal fixed bridge? Any idea as to how my situation will be handled? Will the teeth break either the permanent or temporary bridge in trying to move back where they were, due to the root tension? Will the roots ever truly stretch out enough to make the teeth quit trying to go back?"

    "dialogue": "maxwellc: My far back right tooth broke slightly after a punch to the face years ago, only a little fell out and it wasn't causing me any difficulty so I left it. This was about 6 years ago. A couple of times over the years it got a bit sore, I brushed it and the gums bled a little, but both times the next morning it was fine.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I was eating a granary baguette and the tooth broke. Around this time I noticed that the tooth smelled pretty bad. Therefore I thought I'd better see the dentist. This was probably the first time I'd been in 7-8 years. She thought she might be able to put a filling in that one, and I needed another filling. \n\nI had orthodontic treatment (I had them off around the same time I last went to the dentist)  and the retaining wire on the inside of my bottom teeth is still there. There was quite a lot of build up on this, so I visited the hygenist who scraped off 7-8 years worth of the build up. It was uncomfortable and there was quite a bit of blood, but my teeth felt good.\n\nAnyway, I went to have my fillings done. She gave me injections and started on my broken tooth, but soon saw that the decay went under the gum line and just put a temporary filling in there. She said I could either have it out or they could attempt root canal.\nFor the other filling, she started drilling, and it felt pretty sharp. Sometimes she'd be drilling and I wouldn't feel a thing, sometimes it would be sharp. So I relaxed as best I could and thought of other things, but she'd still sometimes hit a sharp bit and make me wince. I was trying hard to ignore it so sometimes I'd just blink or squint a little and she'd back off. She turned the water off which seemed to help at first, but then it'd hurt again.\n\nShe said the anaesthetic wouldn't prevent it being sensitive. I don't really understand what she meant by this. It wasn't really bad pain but it was a nasty feeling. She kept saying if I couldn't cope with the pain she'd have to refer me to someone for sedation. I said I was OK to continue. She said to raise my hand if it hurt, but I wanted her to just do it. In the end she said she could see I wasn't comfortable, and that made her uncomfortable, so she was going to refer me to a community dentist for the filling and extraction under sedation.\n\nI'm not a great fan of dental treatment but I didn't go there feeling anxious. I've had two teeth out under local anaesthetic before and it was fine. I admit I was quite tense, but I did relax myself when it started causing me discomfort.\n\nAlthough having my teeth crushed is probably my Room 101, I didn't think I had a problem with dental treatment, and I didn't think I had a low pain threshold either. Am I a bad patient, because that's how I felt? Are you supposed to be able to suppress the wince? Rosalind: Pain on filling\n\nI think you didn't have the tooth anaesthetised properly. I have had pain like this before and then been given a different injection straight into the tooth (don't know what it is) which works instantly.\nIt's not you and you should insist on sufficient anaesthesia for comfort SEOSmile: Sedation issues\n\nI completely agree. I've had issues with being sedated and with anesthesia and have had to stop them mid drill or mid cut. Always alert your dentist to any issues. They are they to help not hurt you."

I've had those teeth re-filled, but am still having problems.\n\nThis annoyance is with me constantly and makes it hard to concentrate on anything.  I've started to clench my teech at night and wake up with sore teeth and sometimes a sore jaw.  \n\nI need help finding someone in the Minneapolis area that is an expert on occlusion/bite.  Please let me know if you can help."

    "dialogue": "JakeD: For about 2 years I've been seeing a Polish dentist under the NHS. He's the worst dentist I have ever known in my life, and I'm well past 50. His work typically fails within two or three weeks, and he sends me away with crowns and fillings that stand too proud for me to close my teeth. After \"turning the other cheek\" several times, it became clear to me that this dentist was very sub-standard. I asked the practice receptionist where the man was trained and she said 'Poland'. I asked to be switched to a different dentist (a better trained, more experienced one). She offered to put me with another one - also with a foreign-sounding name. I asked: \"what are his qualifications?\" She said: \"D-dent Kaunas\". I asked: where did he receive his training? She said \"Lithuania\". I asked: \"Don't you have anyone who was trained in the UK?\" She said \"No\". Having had such awful standard of treatment from an east-European-trained dentist, I wasn't ready to immediately trust another one. I went onto the internet and searched for the qualification \"D-dent\" and \"d.dent\". Nothing whatsoever came up! So now I'm concerned that the dentists working at this practice are not properly trianed or qualified. I gather that every dentist practising in the UK should be registered with the General Dental Council. However, when I searched the GDC practitioner database for my Polish Dentist and the Lithinaian dentist, neither name came up!\n\nIs NHS dentistry no longer properly monitored and policed? If so, this is an awful situation. I gather that every foreign dentist is supposed to pass an exam in order to practise in the UK. But is this exam too easy to pass (or too easy to pass fraudulently)?\n\nAll I want is an NHS dentist (quickly), whose competence I can count on. But how?\n\nThanks...\n\nJakeD"

Update: another piece busted off; now my tooth (to my tongue) feels more like the Seattle Space Needle than Mount Rushmore. pascale1973: Cap or root canal or extraction....\n\nIt's odd that you're not feeling pain at this point, you might have already had a root canal done on this tooth? because with so many pcs coming off you'd think you'll feel some pain.  Either way, the options will obviously depend on the diagnosis, here's what I think:\n\nIf enough tooth structure is left and the nerve is vital - the Doc might be able to save the tooth by doing a buildup (composite tooth structure) and crown or cap\nIf there's not enough tooth structure left and decay is deep - extraction\nIf there's a prior root canal and the root canal is good - post buildup and crown \nIf there's a prior root canal and an abscess - the doc might retreat your root canal post buildup and crown\nif there's a prior root canal and an abscess that's too bad - the doc might extract.\non and on and on.\nSo what's really important is not to ignore your situation because, the longer you wait the worse the treatment and the more expensive....Listen to your wife!, you don't have to let her know she's right bclayshannon: bclayshannon said:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tUpdate: another piece busted off; now my tooth (to my tongue) feels more like the Seattle Space Needle than Mount Rushmore. Based on a report I found via Googling, I ate two cans of cashews in a 24-hour period, and the tooth has stabilized. I was having intermittent extreme pain prior to that, and when I coughed or sneezed, it felt as if my tooth was lifting up, &c.\n\nAlso, cloves applied directly to the painful area helped alleviate the pain while the cashews were working."

    "dialogue": "flynnie2485: Hello, So I have excruciating pain in my front lower left tooth , I believe Its called the left cuspid, I broke my jaw in this spot (and a few other) about 8 years ago and it rearranged the tooth a little bit, but after the wires came out its been fine since then, absolutley no pain until I woke up one morning and the tooth and jaw was sore. I went to the Dentist, the took x-rays and adjusted the bite a little bit, and sent me on my way. The tooth looks fine, and im guessing by if they took x-rays there was no visible problems, but it still hurts a lot. I mentioned I might grind my teeth at night and the dentist didnt think much about it. So I did a little research and I have all the reasons that lead to bruxism- acid reflux, anxiety, high amounts of caffeine. I got a mouth guard from the drug store and been taking a lot of advil, Any advice, suggestions, past experiance is a help, because the pain is pretty bad now , cant put any pressure on the tooth and it hurts down to the jaw. And its not hot/cold sensitive. thanks for the help!"
