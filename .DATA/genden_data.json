    "title": "Bad dentist/ Bad Implants/Out $40,000.00",
    "dialogue": "lou277: I need help!  I am from Wisconsin, and I trusted a dentist in Chicago to place zygomic implants in my upper arch as I had no bone left to do regular implants.  $40,000.00 later, I have nothing in my mouth.  The last time I was in his office was in March 2024, a year and one monthafter placing the implants, The permanent denture broke off, and I later found out that 3 of the 5 implants had failed.  He was supposed to place the final denture in July 2023, however, his assistant kept telling me it takes a long time to make them. I asked him when the dentist would be looking in my mouth.  I told him I paid the dentist for his expertise, and all I am getting is a dental assistant who does not know what he is doing. He told me the dentist only looks at the scans.  After my initial surgery in Feb. 2023 the temporary denture broke 12 times.  Each time, I had to travel to Chicago and  sit for 7 hours .  The fix would last maybe a month and then break again.  He charged me $5000.00 for dentures that were supposed to fit over my mini implants on my bottom arch.  He replaced mine with  acrylic dentures that also broke several times.  He never placed o rings or housings in the holes.  He put blue like paper liner in the denture and said it was a new technique.  My previous lower dentures were fine , however, the dentist said I had to have new lowers to match my new uppers.  He threw my lower dentures away.  He claimed that he gave them back to me, but he did not.  I could write a book on all the mistakes, that were made.  The dirty office and equipment. The lack of dentist supervision.  It took him 10 months to look into my mouth, and that was only because of the infection that  was so bad, the assistant did not know what to do.   I have photos of my mouth and the infections. It took them 2 weeks  to call in a prescription for an antibiotic..  When I left his office in March, I knew I would need my records.  I asked for my records verbally and made a written request as well.  Today, August 5, 2024, I just received what he claims are my records.  There is not one x-ray, patient notes, or anything else that you would normally find in a dental record.  He sent me lots of forms.  Some I had seen and signed, but most of the forms I had never seen, but they do  have my forged signature on them.  He copied my signature from one form to another.  The forgery is so obvious. So I gave the office a call and my call was immediately forward to a recording that states the person whom you are trying to call no longer will be taking phone calls from this number.  So he blocked me from calling, texting, or emailing him.  Now I contacted an attorney in Chicago, and they said it would not be worth it to take him to court.  They said by the time I pay the attorney, there will be little money left to get my dental work done. I was hoping that all the photos and recordings that I had would help me get my money back.  But with no attorney, I doubt I will be able to use any of them.  I am sure you are thinking why did I stay with them for so long.  All I can say is  he had $40,000.00 of mine and I had no money to hire someone else.  I kept praying that it would get better and that the final result would be good.  I can't eat, sleep and I am in constant pain.  I do not go out of my house.  I was working as a photographer, which I quit.  How can I smile at my clients with no teeth.  I am broke financially now and I do not know what to do.  Any suggestions that anyone has would be greatly appreciated.  Lou Ann"

I was told not to worry due to there being slight bone loss due to the overcrowding in my mouth Dr M: Overcrowding, could lead to difficulty in cleaning. Excessive plaque build up, could then lead to inflammation and eventual bone loss. If the crowding pushed the tooth more buccal or lingual, there could also be reduced bone in the area, due to the positioning of the tooth. Asun_1222: Heres a picuture of my recent x-ray \nCan u tell me all the areas you see bone loss? Dr M: Looks like there might be some bone loss around your upper last molars. Difficult to see around your lower front teeth. Best option would be to see a periodontist, so that the bone level can be determined via periodontal probing. primrosedayton: Hi Asun_1222It looks like there might be some bone loss around your upper back teeth. It's a bit difficult to see what's happening with your lower front teeth on this X-ray. To get a clear picture of your bone health, it's best to schedule an appointment with a periodontist.

    "title": "How to deal with a tooth hole that has yet to close after 2-1/2 weeks?",
    "dialogue": "Playforfun: Hey all, I was hoping to get some dental advice. So, I had my right upper wisdom removed 2-1/2 weeks ago. It seems to be a simple extraction as my dentist did it really fast and the whole tooth was intact when removed. However, my dentist said it was close to my maxillary sinus so he placed 2 pcs of dental gelfoam soaked in saline as protection for my sinus and as a hemostatic. Past forward, the wound healed quite well except for a mid-sized hole left on the center. This hole is hollow and a little deep, red at the bottom with no blood clot. The surrounding gums looked normal and a little pinkish. Have some minor pain and discomfort from the site at times. I noticed this as early as 1 week and didn't thought I had a dry socket since my pain was not severe. But by close to 2 weeks, I got worried so I called up my dentist and booked an appointment. On appointment day, my dentist checked and said I had a dry socket since I dislodged the blood clot on that center area. For context, I mouthwashed very frequently even just after the extraction and I must have dislodged it during that time. Any case, my dentist placed a temporary filling with Eugenol. He said that the filling will harden after several hours and fall off causing irritation on the area and bleeding which would hopefully start the healing process once again to fill up that hole. After 10 days, if in case this didn't work, he would have to inject me with local anesthetic and make the area bleed again and stitch it up for additional precaution. I'm quite afraid tbh since I have some dental phobia. I wanted to ask if anyone else had this situation and what happened. I would very much appreciate your input. Thanks Dr M: If you had no pain, I would not have interfered with the socket. Dry socket, usually appears 3-5 days after an extraction and is accompanied by severe pain. It is also classified as a self-limiting disease, which means it would have cleared up eventually by itself, without any intervention. The only reason we intervene most of the time, is to relieve pain.\nIf you have no further pain, I would just be patient. A socket can sometimes take a month to fully close. Playforfun: Thank you Dr. M.  I wanted to ask have you heard about this procedure of making the area bleed again to restart healing and stitching it up to make sure the hole closes?Also, how do I keep the area clean since it is exposed to toothpaste daily when I brush and food.  I'm kind off worried about infection, at least until the socket closes? Dr M: We do sometimes try to induce bleeding again to assist the healing process. There is different techniques to do this.\nBest way to keep it clean is to rinse with luke-warm salt water after a meal and avoid brushing in this area. Playforfun: Thank you very much! oh so, I can't brush with toothpaste for a while?  I generally try to avoid brushing the area but toothpaste suds still gets into the hole since I brush all other teeth and the tooth near it Dr M: Toothpaste should not cause any issues. Brush the rest of your teeth as normal, just not in that area dental_care: Your dentist is managing the dry socket effectively with Eugenol to aid healing. Avoid aggressive mouthwashing to prevent further dislodging of the clot. Minor pain is normal; monitor for severe symptoms. Follow your dentist’s instructions and seek immediate care if the condition worsens. Playforfun: Thank you all for the replies.  So I just wanted to consult something.  It has been a month since my upper wisdom tooth removal and the hole still persist with pain and discomfort.So what happened is that the medicated cement with Eugenol that my dentist placed 3 weeks ago, just came off 3 days ago.  It was originally supposed to fall off just SEVERAL HOURS after placement since he said that its purpose is to irritate and cause bleeding on the area to restart the healing process.  That did not happen.  On my followup with him 10 days after placement of the medicated cement, he said it would be okay to just wait until the medicated cement (Eugenol) to fall off on its own since it would also serve now as protection for the site.  It did fall off, but only after almost 3 weeks.Now, when it fell off, I was happy since I was thinking that there was already new gum tissue underneath that pushing the medicated cement upwards, but no, the area is still hollow and now reddish unlike before my dentist placed that cement 3 weeks ago.  I told my dentist about this and he said the color will come back to normal.  Now, I have a bit more pain and discomfort in the area since it is now exposed(?).  Dentist said that is to be expected until the area completely closes.My question is do dry sockets really last this long on healing?  Will it even still heal after this long time?  Could the medicated cement's presence have prevented healing since new gum tissue cannot grow with it being there (imagine it stayed there for 3 weeks instead of just several hours as originally planned)?  Why is the area reddish, is it because the medicated cement irritated it?  Is there really pain accompanying dry sockets?  Coz whlie my pain is not severe, it increased from before (when the medicated cement was still there) and it is annoying.  It seems my dentist's plan is to just observe it and take pain meds as necessary.  He said the area is already in the process of healing but he said it may take 2 months?  Does it really last that long?  Kinda worried since its hard to manage the area and keep it clean.Now, I am not sure if there is already evidence of healing present on my site, all I see is that the edges of the hole are reddish and in the center is a bit red with some whitish stuff.  The surrounding gums are whitish-pink and looked normal and healthy, its only that spot that's reddish.  Thank you for all the answers Playforfun: Sorry for the lengthy post, but I hope someone could advise me regarding my questions.  Thanks. Dr M: Does not sound like a dry socket. The introduction of a foreign body into the socket, such as eugenol, could have delayed the healing process. A normal socket can take a month to close. Delayed healing could lead to a longer timeline of healing. If the pain is manageable, I would just be patient. It should gradually get better. If it doesn't in another 2 weeks, I would suggest taking another x-ray. Perhaps there is a root fragment left over or another tooth in the area that needs attention. Playforfun: I am not sure about a root fragment, coz it was a normal fast extraction.   The teeth was not sectioned and I even still have the teeth, its looks intact, even on the roots.  The tooth beside it looks okay as well.  No bleeding or inflammation whatsoever.  I'll be more patient since it indeed might have delayed healing since the Eugenol stayed there for so long.  Thanks!"

    "dialogue": "Playforfun: So I was diagnosed with dry socket by my dentist.  Didn't expect I had it since I was having not much pain.  Packed it with medicated cement with Eugenol.  Dentist said its purpose is to irritate the area and cause bleeding that would restart the healing process.  Cement was supposed to fall off several hours after, but it didn't.  Came back after 10 days to dentist with the cement still in.  He said the site and surrounding gums look fine, so let's just leave the medicated cement on it as it will also double as a protection.   After another 10 days, the medicated cement fell off on its own.  The site and walls of the tooth hole is reddish, the center is also reddish.  I am not sure if there is newly growing/healing tissue in there or if there is even a new clot.  Dentist said that the color of tooth hole would return back to normal.  I had a little more pain and discomfort now than when I still had the medicated cement in.  Dentist said pain and discomfort are expected so long as the site is still open.  The surrounding gums are light pinkish and looked healthy though.  Dentist said that the site would heal slowly since I had dry socket.  I was due to come back for teeth cleaning, but he said to come back instead after 2 months to wait for the site to completely heal.  For management, I just gargle with saltwater and gently irrigate the area with saltwater.Questions:\n1.  Do some dry sockets really heal this long?\n2.  Is it possible that the medicated cement irritated the area which is why it got reddish since it stayed there for too long (almost 3 weeks before it came off instead of just several hours as originally planned)?\n3.  Why did I have a little more pain and discomfort now than when the medicated cement was still on it?\n4.  Does Eugenol stay active in its anesthetic effect even after a long time of being there?\n5.  What other options are there for me to heal this dry socket faster?"

    "dialogue": "Serenadasa23: Hello everyone, I will try to keep this as brief as possible. Early June started with a toothache in the afternoon. It progressively got worse overnight so first thing in the morning went to urgent care. At this point did not have swelling in my face yet, just intense pain. Was given Augmentin and a dentist to make an appointment with, since I did not have one. I took the antibiotics right away. A few hours later, I felt what could only be described as an \"explosion\" into my left cheek. From there the swelling started, however by the following morning it was starting to go down already, presumably due to the antibiotics I started. So I didn't worry too much. Three days later had dentist appt. took the traditional x rays which showed a large periapical abscess. It was decided to remove the tooth that same day, which was uncomplicated. The swelling in my cheek was almost non existent by now, but I did ask about it, I said I suspected some sort of cellulitis or spread into what I have learned is \"buccal space\" but I was told \"the antibiotics will take care of everything else now that we removed the tooth\". So I didn't question it further.\nThe tooth socket healed fine, I finished my antibiotics but I am convinced I still have a tiny bit of swelling in my cheek, and it's been over a month. Also, I feel a little bit of pressure that just isn't going away. I called the dentist back who then gave me another 5 day course of clindamycin, which did not help at all. Do these things really just take time? I am scared because in my internet research it seems anything in the buccal space has to be drained by making an incision. But I get that if not much swelling was present who would think that anything was there? When I presented to the dentist it had gone away for the most part. but I feel like if I had presented to the urgent care when I had the swelling for a few hours at most, they would have admitted me for IV antibiotics and cut my cheek open. since it started disappearing almost as soon as it came on, I didn't think much of it. Only in my research afterwards am I finding out that this is what they do when there is swelling. Anything in the cheek cannot drain through the tooth socket when they extracted it, right? Because I was told \"the infection drained through the tooth when it was extracted, so there would be no need to make more incisions\" If there is no more infected tooth, can the body just absorb all the rest? could there possibly be a need to have anything else drained? and if so, who do I see? what imaging test would show it? Since I don't think the traditional x rays would? Dr M: You need to determine if the tooth that was removed, was the only cause of infection. Sometimes there is more than one tooth that leads to infection. I would suggest starting with another x-ray post extraction. If there is no other cause and the swelling is still present, incision and drainage would be needed. In my opinion the dentist would then need to refer you to an oral surgeon."

    "title": "Pain chewing with re-attached crown",
    "dialogue": "bordor: I have been traveling overseas and had a crown fall off which was re-attached by a dentist during my travels. Since that time I periodically have pain on the tooth when chewing. It feels like my upper teeth are hitting the tooth too hard or something. I don't have pain chewing all types of foods. Some there is no pain at all. The pain seems to depend on texture - I'm more likely to experience pain when chewing things like lettuce or fresh veggies, or soft chewy things rather than hard things.A little background about this crown. It was initially placed around 2008 on a cracked tooth. The tooth was sensitive to chewing at that time as well, and I had to get a number of bite adjustments before I could chew on it comfortably, but it did get to the point where I rarely had discomfort. Now and then over the years I have had sensitivity but not enough for it to be a serious issue. So it went for years until the crown fell off just recently.The dentist who re-attached the crown mentioned that there was a lot of old dark colored glue along the base of the tooth, and she said that she was not able to remove it. If I explore the area with my nail and finger I can actually feel the glue now at the base of the tooth. My impression is that when the crown was re-attached it was not pushed all the way down over the tooth. There seems to be an open margin between the base of the crown and my gumline. Is this normal or should the crown form a seal with the gumline? I'm wondering if it's possible it's because the crown is riding too high in my mouth and was not pushed down all the way that it is causing so much discomfort when I'm chewing? But if that's true, why? Is there a reason the dentist might have chosen not to push the crown all the way down when re-attaching it?Could I get another dentist grind down the surfaces which my other teeth are hitting too hard, so that I could chew more comfortably?  My main concern right now is that if the crown were now removed again by another dentist in order to be re-set, the force of pulling it off could further stress the cracked tooth underneath, and make the tooth even more sensitive than it already it is. For this reason I'm hesitant to have any work done on it that isn't absolutely necessary.Any thoughts/suggestions about next steps would be appreciated. Dr M: Seems like not all of the old cement was removed. The crown should form a proper seal. If not, leakage and secondary decay could occur. You can grind the tooth down a little bit in order to alleviate pressure, but I would recommend seeing a dentist, so that an x-ray can be taken to evaluate the fit of the crown. Might be time for a brand new one."

Ruined my teeth and sent me spiral down road of humiliation and debt. Spent 15 years trying find someone who would do composites instead of porcelains veneers and couldn’t find anyone. Why isn’t this being done? Everyone is pushing porcelain and the labs make the veneers / over 90%.  Any dentist on here replacing porcelain veneers with composite? Answers I got were takes to long, porcelain are better, stronger,look nicer. I don’t care I wanted the composite and it’s like a foreign procedure. I had to have my friend dentist do a composite veneer for me on 1 tooth because my second round of veneers At age 28, I paid for 8 and only got 6 because they don’t line up. I let the dentist keep the money because he couldn’t send them back and I agreed To pay. I’m 34 Now and spent 30k on veneers, it’s insane these procedures should never be a first line option.Currently I’m having trouble with my bite and considering removing 2 more porcelain veneers for composite due to porcelain underneath the tooth. They always said veneers lay in front of tooth and never tell you actually goes underneath the tooth as well. There should be a black box warning for porcelain veneers to be used last resort and caution and show what ur teeth will look like before, all grinded down to tooth. A majority of these\nShould be considered  cases could be prevented but since its “cosmetic” then dentists has a free pass.I attached pictures before and after of first procedure and don’t get how a licensed  professional dentist opinion was to put 6 veneers on an 18 year old who went in to have small chip and gap fixed. huge thick veneers that look nothing like teeth. I went back to him 4-5 times and he eventually said please stop coming back, you’ll get used to them, it’s a long drive from your college. Said couldn’t do anything else. flomodental: As an experienced dentist in Flower Mound, working at FloMo Dental, I often get asked why we typically do not replace porcelain veneers with composite. The primary reason is that porcelain veneers offer superior durability and a more natural appearance than composite materials. Porcelain is a robust material that resists staining and mimics the translucency of natural teeth, providing a seamless and aesthetically pleasing result.Additionally, porcelain veneers provide better structural integrity and are more resistant to wear and tear, making them a more long-lasting solution. While composite veneers are less expensive upfront, they often require more frequent maintenance and replacements, which can be inconvenient and costly over time. At FloMo Dental, we emphasize providing the best quality care and materials, ensuring that our patients receive the most effective and durable treatment options available, especially when enhancing their smiles with Porcelain Veneers in Flower Mound."

    "title": "Possible continued infection?",
    "dialogue": "Serenadasa23: Good day everyone. I will try to keep this as short as possible.One day in early June, I came down with a toothache. I didn't think much of it at first. Took some ibuprofen, went to bed. In the middle of the night, it got unbearably worse. Took the day off work, and since I did not currently have a dentist to call- I went to an urgent care center who gave me Augmentin and set me up with a dentist to call. Took the first pill immediately. Swelling had not really started yet- but what did happen was about 3-4 hours after leaving the urgent care and taking the antibiotic, I felt what could only be described as an explosion in my cheek. No pus was draining out of my body/mouth- it appeared to have burst into what I have now learned are called the \"buccal\" spaces. Then the swelling started up pretty gnarly. However, by the end of the following day it had already started to reduce, because of the antibiotic. Two or three days later I went to the dentist, who did x rays. On them, I could see what was a large periapical abscess. Whatever was going on in my cheek was obviously not visible on the regular x ray, I wouldn't think. but the classic dark circle abscess under the tooth was clear as day. By this point the swelling in my face had all but gone away. It was just very mild. The decision was made to extract the tooth right then and there, since I had already been taking the augmentin. I did mention what had happened to my cheek, and was told by dentist that now that the tooth was out, the antibiotics would clear up anything else.The extraction went off with no problems, and healed perfectly. I finished the ten day course of augmentin. However, the very last bit of swelling (only noticeable to me, no one else notices) never really went away. and I just sort of feel a \"fullness\" in the area. like a little bit of pressure but no pain. I was then given a 5 day course of clindamycin after calling in with these complaints- and those gave no change at all. It's not the absolute end of the world, but the \"fullness\" is annoying and is affecting my sense of well being. it seems to feel different at different times of day. It has even radiated to my ear here and there.I suppose my question is what the heck do I do now? Call the dentist again? Go to the Emergency room? Do I need IV antibiotics? a CT scan? since my swelling is so minor that even I question if it is really there or just from me poking at it. Do I need my cheek cut open and a drain put in? Why weren't those things done when I went for my appointment to begin with? or why wasn't I referred out somewhere for it? That has lead me to believe that it must be all in my head, because if I needed those things done, wouldn't a dentist have suggested it? Does something like this just have a long recovery time? Because I swear some days it feels like it is going away altogether and others it bothers me. any advice?"

    "dialogue": "william_: Hi there,I recently had a check-up with my local dentist in Britain who belongs to the {my}dentist dentistry group. I was told that I have some \"tooth-surface loss\" over the tops of my teeth, though it is minimal. For some years now I have had a problem with chewing on anything that is not soft, and I now understand that this \"tooth-surface loss\" is the problem. I think this problem began because some years ago I remember on a handful of occasions I unluckily had some grit in what I was eating which probably fractured the tops of my molars a little. Though, I don't think that can account for the problem entirely, as I think it has worsened since then, and I suspect that the high level of stress in my life—increasing the acidity in my body, I guess—, my habitually dry mouth, and possibly bruxism (though I haven't confirmed this last one yet) have all contributed to the problem.The dentist I mentioned told me that there is nothing to be done about it, and that any \"fillings\" would just fall-off as my teeth are otherwise still whole and complete. Besides some minor gingivitis, which I am going to treat, my teeth are healthy; albeit a little crooked by genetics, though I'm considering braces (I am in my thirties).So would Crowns be a solution for me? If so, are the cheaper metal variety just as good as the more expensive porcelain kind? I guess that the metal kind are cheaper because they are uglier, but I really don't mind about that so-long as they're not significantly inferior is terms of their function, and so-long as they're not a health  hazard. Was this dentist correct to say that there is nothing to be done about it? I noticed after the appointment that this dentist's prices are about half that of other dentists in my area, and so I wonder whether this dentist was cheaper because he was less knowledgeable and proficient? Though that's just speculation on my part and I have no solid reason to suspect this of him otherwise. Dr M: It depends on the amount of tooth structure loss. The enamel loss could also be normal due to normal functioning or grinding habits. I would not recommend crowns if the loss is minimal. To prepare a crown on the tooth, you would need to sacrifice otherwise healthy tooth structure. Maybe consider getting a bite plate first. This will help to protect your remaining tooth structure."

    "title": "Hard pressure, tension, feeling near upper left rear molar",
    "dialogue": "gummidge: Hello,The last couple of days I have a sort of continuous feeling of pressure around my left upper molar, I think it's called the 2nd molar?  I can't say for sure it's the tooth that hurts, sometimes it feels more like it's the jaw. It's around the area and difficult to pin down. The level of pain comes and goes, and I have the idea that it decays when I'm lying down or not using my jaw. When I wake up in the morning the pain feeling is completely gone, and comes and goes during the day. I can best describe it as someone tightening a screw and putting a lot of pressure on it.I've only had one day, last Wednesday, were the pain was so constant throughout the day were I felt the need to take a pain killer. On Thursday it felt more like the environment around the tooth was slightly bruised. Friday and Saturday the pressure feeling comes and goes again, but is definitely manageable and a lot of time not even noticeable.I called my dentist on Wednesday, but it was her last day before her 3 week holiday, and she told me that it's strange to feel something a month after an intervention, and we now only have the last resort of pulling the tooth, but as I don't wake up from pain of really feel the need to take pain killers, to try and sit it out, take a pain killer when the need arrives, and check back in after she returns from her holiday. She also told me that taking a photo wouldn't yet show signs of an infection. So I have no pictures at the moment.I have no pain when biting on it, at least with tender things. Hard items such as a peanut I can definitely feel but that has been the case the last couple of years. No issues with hot or cold, or when brushing my teeth.The reason I'm pointing to that tooth is because it's the one were 30 days ago I had a filling put in. The tooth has been under repair for at least 5 years, and in February a special deep filling was put in, which had to sit and heal for 3 months before the filling could be properly finalized, which was then done at the beginning of June. I don't know the name of the material used. A week later however another side of the tooth broke of, I think it was just too loose from the other side which had the filling. I was chewing on a sandwich and it just dropped out. This was fixed on the 18th of June. I had the default sensitivity issues the first couple of days, but after a good week all seemed back to normal.Fast forward to last weekend and I wasn't feeling too great, signs of a common cold maybe but that was gone after a day or 2 and for some reason I had a more elevated hearth rate. But I kept feeling some very very mild discomfort around that part of my tooth/jaw. Wednesday the 17th I woke up and started my day which had a lot of calls and meetings, so a lot of talking, and throughout the day the pain got more and more severe. It felt like someone put a rubber band around the area and was constantly squeezing it. Looking online for symptoms I read a lot about \"nagging pain\" or \"throbbing pain\", related to a nerve pain and tooth decay, but I never felt something like this before so I find it difficult to say it's this or that. I don't really know what a \"nagging pain\" feels like. I also can't say I'm really experiencing any other symptoms which they always describe.I have the feeling it comes more as I am using my jaw, after eating a large meal for example, or talking a lot. A snack or breakfast this morning is hardly noticeable, but I do feel there is something there, pain wise. When lying down on the couch or in bed it tends to disappear.I can't really find myself in most of the symptoms described online. Anyone any ideas on what this could be? Or the beginning of? As I mentioned before, my regular dentist is currently on holiday and I can manage it but don't quite know what I might expect the next couple of days/weeks? I don't just want to contact another clinic and/or have the tooth removed as the issue might be something else?"

    "dialogue": "ToothPatient: I got this cavity filled:It was actually fine, a little cold sensitivity, until the end of week 2.But I definitely over did it with flossing between those teeth (after every meal, about 5 times a day).Eventually after so much flossing, I went to floss and got very noticeable pressure sensitivity (which I never got after the filling for the two week period).That has gone, but cold sensitivity is very apparent now.Is it possible all that excess flossing irritated the nerve, and now I have heightened cold sensitivity? (no sensitivity to heat or warm fluids, only cold) This is the inside and outside of the filled tooth, pics taken today on my camera phone.I hardly displaced or debonded some of the filling with all that flossing, and that's causing the sensitivity?Any idea what might be happening here?Again, only very minor cold sensitivity two weeks after the filling, but after going heavy with flossing, pressure and cold sensitivity eventually emerged. Dr M: It seems like it was a very deep filling. A more recent x-ray will most likely show that the filling is close to the nerve. If the filling is very close to the nerve, it is normal to have some cold sensitivity. If the symptoms become more severe and you start having spontaneous pain as well, it might mean that the nerve was affected, or that the filling went into the nerve, and then it is an indication of a root canal that is needed.

This irritation can make the area more sensitive to temperature changes, particularly to cold.

    "dialogue": "ben776: Hello I recently had to change my dentist, and the new dentist said that there's decay between my right central and lateral incisors. I brush 3 times a day after meals, and I'm surprised that I have a decay going on in that area (he told me that there's no other problem in my mouth). I'm aware that naked eyes cannot catch everything, but to me it looks perfectly fine, and I don't want to drill something that's not problematic.Attached is my x-ralso of the same teeth. He was pointing out the grey area, but I thought that was just from the angle of the x-ray and how the teeth are overlapping. Do you actually think that there's decay going on?Thank you very much! Dr M: It looks like there might be the start of some de-mineralization in the area, but it is not through your enamel yet. This is not an indication for a filling. Focus on flossing more in that area and maybe use a fluoride containing mouth rinse. This area can only be monitored for now, since it might start re-mineralizing again. Doing a filling there would be over-treatment in my opinion. ben776: Dr M said:\t\t\tIt looks like there might be the start of some de-mineralization in the area, but it is not through your enamel yet.

However, obviously, I don't have the proper knowledge to look at dental xrays. Could you please take a look at these other xrays?I really really appreciate it! Dr M: Don't see other cavities that you need to worry about. A lot of the slightly darker areas is called cervical burnout and it just due to the positioning of the x-ray sensor and not cavities. Continue to go for your regular check-ups."

At first I thought it was some food or something then I was shocked to find out there was a very big hole in my tooth. \nNow, it isn’t entirely surprising because I haven’t been to a dentist for a long time. I have had reasons for it, I can’t go into further details because this post will be to long. There are also some cariës in my molars but I have the idea they stopped progressing (however these are not entiry holes as wat is going on wit the 5th tooth. I checked the other side 5th tooth, and there also are starting problems because plague gets stuck inbetween the teeth where there is gum recession, however not as severe and I hope this will go away with the new routine I have now. I always brushed my teeth thoroughly, but have extreme dry mouth during the night (probably sleep apnea) and have vitamin D deficiency and other deficiencies which I am working on. Now the reason for my post:  is there maybe a dentist who could tell me if this tooth can still be saved? I get extremely anxious, and have nightmares about it. This made me delay even further, but now I have contacted a new clinic I want to go to. It is making me feel extremely  embarrassed and I suddenly have issues with smiling and I could never imagine I would have that in my life. I feel horrible. Anyone who can give me insight in the situation? Regarding how bad it is and if it still can be saved? Dr M: Depends on how deep the decay goes and for that you would need an x-ray to be taken. If the decay goes into the nerve, then a root canal might be indicated."

    "dialogue": "cactus: I would appreciate if someone can share their experience regarding the oclussal splint. Please note any price listed is in Australian Dollars.My periodontist has advised me that I could consider an occlusal splint if I feel it is necessary. She has advised me that I have issues with a clicking jaw and bruxism and referred me to a general dentist. The general dentist gave me his price, which was $800 however, since I felt he was pushy, I opted not to proceed at the time. I have called around and I also got another price of $500. With all this being said, since I am quite confused by the entire process, should I consider seeing a prosthodontist at a cost of $250 + $ 90 for an occlusal analysis? Since I believe they make these occlusal splints as well or a maxillofacial surgeon to get another opinion? Thank you. Dr M: A prosthodontist might do a better analysis on your bite and recommend a specific type of occlusal splint, that might suit your needs better. The price to do an occlusal splint by a specialist, might be more expensive compared to a general dentist. cactus: Thank you, Dr M. This information is appreciated. I will also enquire with my insurance as to how much they will cover. Also, I wanted to ask your opinion if possible as the periodontist said that tooth 13 could be restored via a filling restoration as there was   restoration done over a decade ago. This was recommended due to sensitivity.However, the dentist who quoted $800 for the splint said that the filling appeared fine and could be filled down if necessary. Though in his opinion, a crown would be recommended if a restoration was required.Whose advice sounds correct here? As I am confused.I am able to attach x-rays if necessary. Dr M: Please attach the x-rays. cactus: Attached Dr M: The filling looks fine. I would not replace any filling, if there is no real indication to do so. Adjust the filling if it interferes with the splint. cactus: Dr M said:\t\t\tThe filling looks fine. I would not replace any filling, if there is no real indication to do so. Adjust the filling if it interferes with the splint.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Thanks for that. Its much appreciated. cactus: Hi Dr M, If your able to, Can you comment on glass ionomer cement (GIC) filling's being able to adequately replace composite fillings?I ask as my periodontist has arranged for me to see a different general dentist and he has advised me that i don't need a crown and my sensitivity on tooth 13 is attributed to a leaking filling.Since I have never heard of GIC hoping you can comment.Thanks Dr M: GlC fillings are more prone to staining compared to composite fillings. They are also weaker fillings compared to composite fillings, when undergoing high occlusal or biting forces. cactus: Thanks for the information Dr M. I will keep this in mind when deciding how to approach the sensitivity with tooth 13."

The picture is a bit difficult to capture this, but is this a demineralized area (which would explain why he didn't touch it)? I looked up some pictures of demineralized enamel, and the color looks different from the area of my tooth. All the pictures seem to suggest a chalky-white color is what we look for, but mine doesn't look chalky at all. It looks a bit more yellowish than the other areas of that tooth. When I touch it with my nail gently, it almost feels softer than other areas of the tooth.Thank you, I would appreciate any input! Dr M: It seems like you have a bit of gum recession on the indicated tooth. The yellow part that you are seeing, is either dentin or the exposed root surface of the tooth. This can't be cleaned off. You can cover it with a resin filling, if the area is sensitive, to match the surrounding tooth structure. You need to start using a softer toothbrush and focus on your brushing technique,"

I am not in pain right now, I just finished my sixth day with augmentin but my dentist in my country says I shouldn't leave it like that, it will do more damage. What should I do? Dr M: Depends on how the x-ray looks. If you are not in pain, you can wait 30 days. Best to do it in one place. The main risk is that the pain might flare up again.

    "title": "Help! Suddenly rough teeth despite teeth cleaning",
    "dialogue": "Anxiety96: Summary: Within a week, my teeth became rougher than they had ever been before. This caused a quite lot of plaque to accumulate and bad breath. After a professional cleaning, the result of which actually looked good, the teeth became similarly rough again within 7 days (!). Despite good oral hygiene and only eating in the morning and evening. Chlorhexidine helps. What could be the cause? What can I do?___\nI am 28 and have had tartar for about 4 years, sometimes more, sometimes less, a few months after a dental cleaning. So far, however, this has been within reasonable limits and has always been removed with a dental cleaning (approx. every 12-14 months). I haven't had any \"real\" tartar recently, i.e. the kind that you can break off when enough has accumulated, and I've rarely had any in the past. It's more like a very thin layer that you can't get off on your own.I now have quite a bit of discoloration in some places. Before my last professional cleaning, the discoloration was also somewhat worse than usual.Up until 4 weeks ago, I thought that everything could be fixed with a dental cleaning (maybe every 6 months if necessary).\nHowever, my teeth then became much rougher within a week. Especially on the insides of the lower front teeth and first molars.\nSo in the place where there is the most saliva and where tartar would later form.\nMy teeth have never been anywhere near as rough and it has never happened so quickly.How can this happen so suddenly?\nI thought that they had simply become so rough so quickly because the rougher the teeth are, the more plaque sticks to them and that at some point the point is reached where plaque and tartar increase exponentially.I also had bad breath, which I only had rarely and briefly before.A week ago I had a dental cleaning. The front teeth in particular were not 100% smooth afterwards, but it was much, much better (maybe 90-95% smooth) and the insides of the molars, which were very rough before, were very smooth afterwards.\nOverall, it felt good and I thought I could now take my time to look for the cause.I discovered a slightly rough spot for the first time after 3 days, but I still thought I was imagining it.\nHowever, on the 6th day after the professional cleaning, I clearly noticed that my teeth were getting rougher again. And one day later, I suddenly had clearly visible plaque edges again and these strange, firmer, white (not yellowish) plaques on the inside of the lower front teeth.I then really tried to remove the plaque with a medium manual toothbrush and a Sonicare on the highest setting (I normally brush with this). I also brushed as hard as you shouldn't do every day. Simply to test whether it would even be possible to remove the plaque with a toothbrush. It wasn't.\nThe plaque can only be \"scraped off\" with a fingernail or scaler. However, I didn't really have to scrape it, but the plaque could be removed relatively easily.\nIt's just so sticky/slimy, which is why you could perhaps compare it to jelly. If I brush jelly with a toothbrush, I would have to do it for a very long time for anything to happen. But I can easily \"scrape\" something off with a scaler.I was also surprised that the bad breath was hardly reduced after the professional cleaning. Especially as I now scrape my tongue daily. I don't know where else the odor is supposed to come from directly after the professional cleaning, which actually looked quite successful.My questions:\n1) How can it be that 7 days (!) after a dental cleaning the teeth become as rough again as they never were before?\nI didn't even eat lunch on 4 of the 7 days. I brushed normally one hour after breakfast and dinner, so that no biofilm should have formed for most of the day.2) What can I do now?\nI don't know where this will lead if I don't do anything. A week after the professional cleaning, I started using chlorhexidine in the morning and evening.\nAs expected, this resulted in no new plaque forming. However, the existing plaque also disappeared after two applications, the bad breath is completely gone and the teeth slowly became smoother again.\nCan any conclusions be drawn from this as to the cause or is the CHX just extremely good at combating the symptoms? Brause: CHX will discolour your teeth (dark)...I have lots of plaque buildup and have my teeth cleaned every 4-6 months. And once a year, I also have a polish to smoothen the teeth.I floss with string and use a Waterpik water flosser."

Sorry the description is quite long...4 years ago I jabbed my molar with a fork, the last one upper right, and believe I caused a hairline crack. Starting that day and for years now on and off I've had a strange sensation of pressure building up there that spreads across the right sinus, causing pain as far as my nose. It comes and goes, doesn't last more than a few days. The crack never showed on an xray/CT but my dentist drilled and bonded the tooth. However the pain kept occasionally recurring for a few days at a time. I saw an ENT to rule out a sinus problem and she saw nothing either. Last year a new dentist recommended a crown to help protect the tooth. 24 hours after she leveled the tooth and fitted me with a temporary I ended up in the ER with a 103 fever, but no visible abscess or drainage. We did a root canal and then refitted the crown, hoping that was that!Sadly, in recent months the pain has returned and somewhat worse than before. I taste excess saliva, occasionally metallic. Much worse when lying down to sleep. But no sensitivity when biting or to hot/cold. The endodontist did another CT scan and could see no bone loss or problem with the root canal. He wouldn't really give an opinion as to my symptoms, he just kept telling me that the root canal looked clean and no problems. It feels like an infection, I don't know how to describe it. I don't have a fever or any visible abscess however, I just feel unwell and tired in addition to the sinus and tooth pain.I've been frustrated because no one will give me an opinion as to what is going on. Is a crack in the tooth irritating a nerve in my sinus? Is there a low grade recurring infection that the CT scan isn't seeing? At this point it feels like extraction is the only option and yet none of the Doctors I have seen will come out and recommend that. They just say \"well we don't see anything\" *shrug*...\nI'm exhausted, worn out, and just feel drained.thoughts? Thanks in advance..."

Now, the abcess did not totally go away. He is now recommending a “simple” surgery ($2500, after spending $4000 on the root canal and crown).I thought I sensed he was a very competent dentist, but now I am wondering. I understand the lower front teeth are perhaps weaker than others (?), but I am so disappointed that he is charging me more, instead of correcting the job I already paid for.I am not looking for a dentist to work for free, but I would like some opinions on this.Thank you. Dr M: Do you perhaps have any x-rays that you could share? It is possible that the abscess was already present for a long time. A chronic abscess has the potential to transform into a cyst. If this was the case, then a root canal by itself would not clear it up. Usually you would need additional surgery such as an apicoectomy."

If it is a multi-rooted tooth, the price would be higher. Prices also change every year due to inflation and the prices of materials also going up. Ajay Bhandarwar: A root canal is a dental procedure to save a tooth by removing infected pulp, cleaning, and sealing the inside. It relieves pain and prevents future infection. Brause: I recently paid (in Calgary, Alberta, Canada):Upper incisor (single root canal): $1750 CAD\nFirst molar (four root canals)): $2900 CADThe work was performed by an Endodontist."

    "title": "Pain in broken molar after root canal treatment",
    "dialogue": "Dentist90: Hi, I have a broken molar that got a root canal treatment last year. Unfortunately, it has to be extracted because it’s broken down the gumline. I went to dentist A last week and he said it’s okay to wait with extraction for a while because it’s not urgent. He also looked at the gum around the molar and said it still looks good. I went to dentist C (same practice) and dentist W (another practice, for second opinion) in February and both didn’t said it was urgent and that the tooth should be extracted asap but that it has to be extracted eventually. I mentioned to C that I suffer from dental phobia and he said I’m lucky the pain isn’t severe and I should do some therapy first before taking the steps. When I asked him if I should be worried  if other parts of my jaw can get infected because of the molar he said no. I do feel pain sometimes but it’s not affecting my daily life like going to work etc. I’m I having pain because the molar is broken? I mean the nerves have been removed during the root canal treatment so I think it’s only caused by the fracture? In general I have a good oral hygiene. I always floss, brush both my teeth and tongue and occasionally use a Waterpik. I have also started rinsing my mouth with warm water and salt. Should I be worried or I’m overthinking right now? Because I’m anxious about it and need some time to so I can go to therapy to work on my fear. Some advice is very welcome! Dr M: Difficult to give an opinion without an x-ray or clear photo of the tooth. It is important to remember however, that a cracked tooth could lead to contamination of the root canal system, which could then result in infection in the tooth. If the tooth fractured and some pieces are mobile, it could also exert pressure on the adjacent gum, causing pain. If there is pain, my opinion would be to extract the tooth."

    "dialogue": "camas worm: I took my almost 5 year old son to the dentist because he was complaining of pain and had pimples under his lower right molar which had been capped the previous year. The dentist said that he wanted to buy some time before extracting it to have the 6-year molar come in so that it would not push into the others spot and be able to Anchor a space holder from it. He sent us home with an appointment in August to check but my son's pimples have turned into a bubble. It  has drained once but has come back and he has had some pain which seems to come and go and for which he does not want pain relievers. I worry from reading about sepsis and such and wonder if this is something that makes sense and I should not be such a worry wart. I appreciate any input. Dr M: Did the dentist prescribe any antibiotics initially? Any chronic abscess on a primary tooth, can adversely affect the permanent successor if left untreated for too long? If the dentist did prescribe antibiotics, and the swelling returned with pain, it might be necessary to extract the tooth at this stage. Phone the dentist to arrange an appointment. MattKW: Mostly abscessed baby teeth will drain the pus thru the pimple, thus averting systemic sepsis, so that at least is in your favour for now.\nAntibiotics will make only short-term relief and should only be prescribed if your child develops a fever or facial swelling. And then the baby teeth should be immediately removed.\nA chronic abscess in this situation is not likely to cause any direct harm to the developing adult teeth below, but it may cause them to start rotating within the bone.\nI get that the dentist wants to wait for the 6s to erupt so he can place a space maintainer, but I think that's too far away. I'd want those baby teeth out ASAP, then go see an orthodontist about how he/she can help manage space maintenance. It can be difficult at this stage because of the facial growth of children. camas worm: Thank you for the responses. I have been worried about his facial growth around all of this also. I live in a valley that is a dentist desert and I'm not sure where to turn. I feel like I need to find someone who has much experience behind them because I am so afraid for my little person. This is top priority and again I appreciate the words. camas worm: Also, the dentist did prescribe him Amoxicillin initially. He wanted to wait 6 months to see which tooth was actually causing the issue thinking it was the second to last molar then when I brought him back a month later he determined it was the last one and that would be the one to be removed. I am feeling like I need to find a Pediatric Dental specialist with more experience as stated before but I do not know where to turn I am in Colorado and any referalls would be appreciated. camas worm: camas worm said:\t\t\tAlso, the dentist did prescribe him Amoxicillin initially.

If you are able to function with them, if you can keep them clean easily (brushing and esp flossing), and if you're not biting your cheeks, then you can leave them in place. paulwilfer: Whether you need your wisdom teeth removed depends on factors like impaction, crowding, decay, or infection, or as suggested by your dentist. or if it functions properly then you must have to take care of them properly. smithwilfer: Wisdom teeth is not required as such.

Although there was a slight improvement after 2 weeks it still didn't feel comfortable.  I booked another appointment and the dentist ground more of the crown until it felt somewhere near comfortable.  I also pointed out to the dentist that the inside of my tooth was rough and told it was where the crown meets the tooth.I'm still not happy with the end result even though I'm used to it now, as half of the crown is showing the metal.  I'm also cleaning the inside of the tooth thoroughly as I'm concerned that plaque etc can easily form and soon undermine the crown.  Can anyone advise how to deal with this matter?  This is the first time the dentist has done work on my teeth (my old dentist left a months ago) and I'm very reluctant to go back.  I'm with a well known private dental care so going elsewhere for a second opinion could be quite costly. Dr M: It sounds like there was no proper planning done. And at this stage the crown is damaged and compromised as well. I would insist on a new crown being made, since it sounds like the underlying tooth was not reduced enough, in order to leave space for the crown. Or the lab, did not design the crown properly. I would not settle for sub-par treatment, since a crown is expensive. Darworth4: Thank you very much for your advice.  I will go back to my dentist to get a new crown fitted."

    "dialogue": "IChewConcrete: Hey, so I'm posting in this thread as I feel this is the one that applies best for my situation. For the past few years, my dental health habits haven't been the best. I brushed twice a day for most of my life, and only started flossing my teeth two years ago. I've gotten to the point where I have maintained my teeth for the past year and half. However, by maintained I mean maintaining the gross looking teeth I already have without them getting progressively worse. I also go to my dentist every 6 months. The dentist has been focusing on the back teeth as opposed to the front. Also, to clarify, I do mean to get advice from my dentist, but would like opinions from other dental health experts too. I would like to improve the appearance of my front teeth, but I do not know where to get started. I have attached some pictures of them to this post, and would like advice on what I can do to improve/fix my teeth and any other things I should take care of.I have posted pictures below. In each picture I assign a number to each tooth, for easy reference. I do need dental work on teeth not referenced, but for now would like to focus solely on the top front 8. Please note that tooth 3 has had a filling in the surface which has gotten stained, and which I will need to get reapplied.Thank you in advance. Also please let me know if this is not the right thread for this sort of post. Dr M: I would consider starting with orthodontics, such as clear aligner therapy. This will close the gap, and decrease the overjet . Thereafter you, can consider a bleaching, where after the stained filling can be replaced."

    "dialogue": "confusedandscared: I went to a dentist for extreme tooth pain/sensitivity in several molars. I get mild, brief pain when any food or drink touches the area between those teeth, and if the food or drink is hot, cold, or extremely sweet, forget it--the pain will almost bring me to tears (though it lasts only a few seconds). This pain/sensitivity started about 6 months ago and only got worse. I'm 24 years old and female. I don't smoke or drink. I floss daily and brush 2x/day for a while now.The doctor performed the cold test, and I had sharp pain, lasting about 3 seconds. He looked at my X-rays and found that I had signs of external resorption in 3 molars, the ones that were causing significant pain. (Although almost all of my teeth have developed similar sensitivity to lesser degrees. He only took X-rays of the ones I said were hurting the most.) He referred me to an endodontist that I will be seeing in 2 days.After googling what external resorption means, I'm freaking out. Most sources are saying that in the majority of cases, the teeth will need to be extracted, which is alarming since all of my teeth have developed the same sensitivity/pain but to varying degrees. My dentist couldn't answer why the resorption occurred and said it could be idiopathic. What could be the cause of this? How do I prevent further resorption?I've never had trauma. I did braces from about 2013-2015 and Smile Direct Club invisible aligners from about 2017-2019. I've been wearing my retainers nightly since completing my last alignment treatment.As of about a month, I also developed some other symptoms I believe may be related like occasional, mild ear and jaw pain (ears will feel mildly painful pressure, jaw is more of an ache and stiffness. I'll have the urge to open wide and stretch it out) and random, brief numbness or pain in my hands and feet 10-20 times a day. Both the facial pain and bodily numbness occur on both sides of my body, but more on the left, which is also where I experience more dental pain.Please help, I'm really at a loss."

I just went to the dentist a couple weeks ago for the first time since i was 17 (no insurance and being poor) I’m currently 24 y/o, and I'm scheduled to get root canals, fillings, and a gum cleaning soon, but they did not mention this to me at all! To be fair, my dentist came in and did not say a word to me besides “open”.  I've always had bad teeth, constant tooth aches when i was little, and my first root canal at 7. I had my bottom right molar pulled at 13. I’ve always brushed my teeth, though flossing is a new habit. Any idea what is causing my teeth to do this? I’m not sure how long my teeth have done this, and it’s making me very anxious. Thank you for any help!! last photo is my left side. Kamal_Khan: I'm sorry to hear about your dental concerns, but I'm glad you're taking steps to address them by incorporating flossing into your routine and seeking dental care despite challenges.\nFrom the images you've shared, it appears that your teeth might be showing signs of wear or erosion, possibly due to various factors such as acid reflux, teeth grinding (bruxism), or even dietary habits. It's essential to discuss this with your dentist during your upcoming appointments to ensure they thoroughly assess your oral health and provide appropriate treatment recommendations.\nAs a dental professional, I understand the importance of addressing concerns like this comprehensively. At ADI Dental, we prioritize patient education and proactive care to help you achieve and maintain optimal oral health. Don't hesitate to reach out to us for personalized guidance and support on your dental journey. [https://www.adi.dental/] Dr M: It does sound like you have some orthodontic issues, perhaps caused ( but not exclusively) by the early loss of the molar. If you lose a molar, the opposing tooth tends to over-erupt over time. This could lead to the skew curve that you noticed. The only way to fix this is with some sort of orthodontic intervention."

Dr M: He referred to the inferior alveolar nerve. On the x-ray it appears like a road running on both the left and right sides in the bottom jaw. Kamal_Khan: In a panorama X-ray, the trigeminal nerve, responsible for facial sensation and motor control, isn't directly visible due to its deep location within the skull.

It excels at managing missed calls and engaging in conversations with patients, handling tasks like scheduling appointments seamlessly so you never have to worry about appointment no-shows – it's nearly impossible to discern it's an AI and integrates with all major dental software management like Dentrix. It's adept at familiarizing itself with all the essential details of your clinic, including insurance information, available procedures, operational hours, and more. There's an intuitive dashboard that allows you to monitor all interactions and step into conversations with patients whenever necessary. Despite being a relatively new player in the market, the setup process was straightforward, and the team was extremely approachable. It has significantly contributed to attracting new patients, particularly effective after hours when the AI instantly addresses missed calls. It's definitely worth exploring if you're looking to enhance patient acquisition. The monthly subscription is surprisingly affordable, considering the immense value it offers.

    "dialogue": "linc1068: Hello,\nThis is my first post here and I am hoping for some advice.In early Feb I went to the dentist for a deep filling in a lower molar, which turned out to be a very painful process as part of the nerve didn't seem to numb properly.  A week after I was in increasing pain so I went back and the dentist went in through the top of the tooth to apply a dressing and said it would need a root canal.  This time the anaesthetic seemed to work well (he used a block at the rear of my jaw) and I was numb all the way up to my eye for 4-5 hours later).Then last week I went back for the root canal - once again the anaesthetic (6.6ml of 2% lidocaine with 1:80000 adrenaline, initially as a block but also inserted directly into the tooth pulp which did absolutely nothing) didn't work effectively on one of the roots.  It was extremely painful.  The dentist stopped trying to clear out that root and again inserted a dressing.  I am supposed to be going back in a week's time for him to try again but as the tooth is still irritated it may end up being delayed further.Firstly I would like to understand, is there any alternative anaesthetic that is likely to work better?  They are blaming it on the nerve being irritated, but the anaesthetic actually seemed to work better the time I was in most pain prior to the appointment, and wouldn't root canals always irritate the nerve?  When the anaesthetic worked effectively it felt a lot stronger across my whole face and lasted far longer, whereas when it hasn't worked I have still been able to feel tingly in my lip in that side and it wore off quite quickly, but apparently they used the same anaesthetic, quantity and application method.Secondly, is there anything I can do at home to help the nerve settle down before the appointment?  Or is there anything I might be doing that could be prolonging the irritation? I did ask the dentist but didn't get a straight answer.  I can manage with pain relief, but just want to do what I can to give the next attempt the best chance of success.Thirdly, if I end up having the tooth extracted (which is the dentists fall back plan), is that not likely to be just as painful if the anaesthetic doesn't work?Thank you for your help.  I am feeling quite terrified about going back so trying to make sure I am as informed about the options as possible."

I asked him which teeth had filling since I didn't really remember at the time and he told me the correct teeth. So I say that my second-to-last teeth in my lower jaw are hurting. He put the paper in and already told me the occlusion looked fine and that he couldn't shave off too much. But instead of going for the filling, he went for my 3-6.

He already said that it's oftentimes just a tiny bit that's off for the bite to hurt. After that, he went over to my 4-6 and filed and left it at that. That tooth has been feeling weird ever since then. Not only that, but I feel like my bite got deeper because of it and that he filed of too much, despite him saying that he can't really do that. I never had the straightest teeth and jaw. My lower front teeth are slightly tipped inwards, making me able to touch the base of my upper front teeth while biting down. I was always able to avoid that contact, but that seems difficult now. Not only that, but I feel like chewing causes me slight headaches.I'm scared now of the possibility that I now HAVE to visit an orthodontist and wear braces at 25. Scared because I worry it'll all get even worse for me. Is it really possible that my dentist shaved of some sort of \"supporting element\" of my teeth? And can that be restored somehow with some \"clever filling\" of maybe the tooth opposite of my 4-6? Any help is appreciated. I was worrying ever since then and feel like a total wreck because of it, thinking of whether or not I made a grave mistake by even having the filling checked out and not just adapting to it. Dr M: It sounds like the possibility was always there that you needed braces anyways, based on the way that you describe your teeth. It is highly unlikely that the dentist would have filed too much off from the tooth. Usually we adjust only a minimal amount, to ensure that the associated teeth are biting correctly on each other. After such an adjustment, it is completely normal that the teeth feel strange for a while, until you get used to it.\nThe pain that you might be experiencing, might be more related to your overall bite. Patients with a deep bite, also tend to grind their teeth, and this explains why the teeth was paining bilaterally. \nI would suggest going for an orthodontic evaluation. This will evaluate all your issues. Patients with deep bites, often tend to develop other, sometimes more serious issues, at a later stage in life. Better to correct it now if possible. FdUpBite: Thanks for your answer. I always figured I had a deep bite, but never thought I had to deal with it since I never really had any problems. For example, my dentist never commented on my gums receding on my upper front teeth, which they don't as far as I can tell.If it's unlikely that my dentist filed off too much, how long do you think I need to get used to it? Again, it's been two weeks. I had a filing done before a few years ago, but I don't think I minded it that much back then.And what do you precisely mean with \"grinding teeth\"? I mean, my teeth do have contact with one another, but I never grinded them due to anxiety or anything. Same thing while sleeping. People never commented on me grinding my teeth at night.But I will consider visiting an orthodontist in the near future, although I'm scared of his assessments. Dr M: Grinding of teeth does not always happen consciously. We sometimes only see the signs on your teeth, even if you don't have pain. It is common with patients with a deep bite, like I mentioned, but an orthodontic evaluation will tell you more. \nAs for the front tooth, try to not think about it. Sometimes we become obsessed about our teeth, to the point where we don't allow ourselves to get used to any changes. Busybee: Yes your dentist could have shaved too much off especially as it seems he adjusted teeth that he hadn't treated without any study models or assessment of your overall bite.  No there is no way to prove it and when these things happen it cannot be easily fixed (if at all) and you may end up being classified as someone who has \"a sensitive bite\".    You can of course go to have orthodontic treatment that you don't want and didn't need previously and then find that helps or it may not help or you could end up with other problems.  Orthodontics is a lifetime commitment. You should get a second opinion about your bite and also consider a bite guard to see if that helps.  It may well be that you will get used to the change over a few months.Ps. I am not a dentist but I  had serious problems with a bite adjustment that went wrong and I can assure you that there is no such thing as a bite \"expert\".  There are good dentists and not so good dentists.   Dentists cannot really critique or appraise another dentist's work on a bite unless they watched them do it and have examined you before and after and have study models to compare. The best thing is to take very good care of your teeth so that you don't need too much treatment."

    "dialogue": "teodorovkristian: Hello. I have the following issue. I had a cyst on my tooth and it had to be extracted. Then I had a bridge put in, but I developed an inflammation and needed a root canal. This was three months ago. Now I notice that the bone under this line of teeth has deformed and receded inward compared to the other side. Since I am not satisfied with my previous dentist, I will be able to see a new one only in the middle of next month.  Additionally, the existing bridge was punctured to perform the root canal procedure and then was filled.What could this bone recession be? And what should I do. P.s. X-ray before root canal. 10x in advance Dr M: It is normal for the bone to recede after you lose a tooth. This recession can sometimes continue for 6 months to a year, before it stabilizes.\nAs for the root canal. Whenever you prepare a tooth in order to place a crown, or a bridge, you technically drill the tooth smaller. Whenever you drill on a tooth, there is a chance that the nerve can become inflamed. Especially if the tooth was heavily restored prior to the preparation. The root canal has to be performed through the bridge at this stage, and unfortunately compromises the bridge. teodorovkristian: Thank You!"

I drank coffee for over a year but stopped a few weeks ago so my teeth don't sustain anymore damage. I regularly smoke  as well. I went to the dentist in October before my insurance was turned off and mentioned the stains and they didn't say anything about them...

I'm just wondering if these are stains or if my enamel has been eroded so I have an idea of what's going. Dr M: A superficial cleaning needs to be done first. If the stains remain, it might be an indication of an enamel defect or some deeper staining being the cause. You will then have to consider fillings on the front teeth. Sometimes resin veneers can be done, which is a cheaper option that porcelain veneers or crowns. It will still improve the appearance, but keep in mind that they can also stain over time , based on your diet and smoking habits. moonbeamz: Dr M said:\t\t\tA superficial cleaning needs to be done first.

    "title": "Bad taste in mouth after gum line filling",
    "dialogue": "Danni M.: Two years ago, I discovered I had a small gum line cavity behind the back molar on the lower, left-hand side of my mouth. Apparently, when I had an impacted wisdom tooth removed years earlier, a tiny piece of my jaw was removed, creating a pocket in my gum where the cavity formed.The dentist told me I needed an amalgam filling, due to the high-moisture content of the area, and that, in spite of the location, it would not be very difficult to treat.I had no problems with it, up until a few months ago when I noticed a faint odor when I flossed the area. I went back to the dentist, who after taking an x-ray, told me there was recurrent decay behind the filling. He told me that there wasn't significant decay, and that it was nowhere near the root. He removed the old filling, drilled my tooth further and put a new filling in, a small portion of which extended below the gum line. He told me that gum injuries heal very quickly, and to take Advil for any pain.I had no pain, but two days later, I developed a bad taste in my mouth. Concerned I had an infection, I took antibiotics, and called the dental office when they opened. I was told that the bad taste was due to natural healing, but to continue with the antibiotics, if I wanted to.After three weeks, when the problem persisted, I was told to come back in for a re-check. An x-ray showed that the portion of the flling below my gum line was stuck in my gum tissue, rather than contoured against my tooth. I was told that my gum was bloody and irritated, and the errant filling piece created a bacterial trap, which was causing the bad taste. I was also told that the x-ray showed no problem with the filling itself.The dentist then proceeded to peel back the gum tissue covering this piece of filling. He said he used a filer to shape the filling to my tooth, and did not do any further drilling. The hygienist cleaned the area afterwards with a hydroponic water pik. They took several x-rays, said it was okay, and that my gum should heal quickly. This was ten days ago. Since then, I've been brushing and flossing gently, taking ibuprofen, doing saltwater rinses after every meal, eating mostly soft foods and chewing on the opposite side of my mouth. However, I still have a bad taste in my mouth, which seems worse after I brush my teeth in the morning. Some days it seems a little better, but the next day, it seems to return. I would describe it as a stale taste, and my mouth doesn't feel clean. It doesn't seem to be coming from the filling.I've never had a problem with food getting stuck back there before or with being able to keep the area clean. I've also never had any kind of issues with my gums, wound healing or bad breath before. I've used a dental mirror to try and look at the area. It looks clean, and I don't see or taste blood, but I think some swelling remains. This has been causing me a lot of stress, and I'd appreciate any input on what could be causing this, if there's anything else I could do to treat the area, and the timeline for when I should expect it to heal and/or when I should consider going back to the dentist. Dr M: When last did you go for a proper cleaning with a dentist or dental hygienist? Danni M.: Dr M said:\t\t\tWhen last did you go for a proper cleaning with a dentist or dental hygienist?\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Thank you for your reply.My last cleaning was two years ago, just prior to having the cavity filled. I'm scheduled for another next month. I don't really have a problem with plaque or tartar buildup, and the dentist told me, prior to doing the work last month, that I was doing a very good job of keeping the area behind my tooth clean. Since the bad taste occurred right after the cavity was refilled, I've been assuming it's connected to that.I don't know if this is related or not, but since I had the work done, my mouth has been drier than normal. I've been sleeping with a humidifier on and sipping water at night. But, when I wake up, I have an off taste in my mouth, almost like I have a cold. I've never had this problem before. I can't drink coffee in the morning any longer because the taste is unpleasant. Even after brushing, this taste lingers. It's not as bad in the evening after I brush again.My biggest concern is that there's an issue with the filling, although the dentist reassured me there was not. In the alternative, I'm wondering if my gums aren't healed and could be causing this.Any further advice would be much appreciated. Dr M: Do you have an x-ray of the filling you could share? Dr M: Dry mouth can contribute to a bad taste in your mouth however. Danni M.: Thank you again for your replies.I don't have a copy of the x-ray, although I can request one today, if you think the filling may be an issue.Do you think it is likely my filling, my gums, dry mouth or something else causing this? Is there anything you would recommend doing at this point? Thanks again for your time. Dr M: A recent x-ray of the tooth will be helpful. A cleaning might also be helpful. 2 years between cleanings is not recommended. We usually recommend once every 6 months. Although you brush twice a day and practice meticulous oral hygiene, there is still some areas that you miss. The build up of calculus can then contribute to inflammation and/or a bad taste in the mouth. Danni M.: Dr M said:\t\t\tA recent x-ray of the tooth will be helpful.

Danni M.: Dr. M,\nI was able to reschedule my dental cleaning, which took place yesterday. I mentioned to the hygienist about cleaning up the amalgam residue under the gum line, and she didn't think this would be a problem. However, upon finishing, she took an x-ray which showed the residual amalgam was actually stuck to the filling. I was told by her and the dentist that I would need to come back to have the filling worked on again. The hygienist, in particular, mentioned the dentist needing to drill.I'm attaching a copy of my most recent x-ray, and I would appreciate if you would take a look. To my unskilled eye, the filling actually looks worse than it did before, and I'm hoping she did not damage it in any way.I understand the filling is in a difficult location, but I'm getting frustrated and concerned by having this tooth continually worked on. Could you please tell me what you would advise? On a positive note, the bad taste has disappeared, at least temporarily. If this remains the case, and the filling is still okay, would it be prudent to put off any further work at this time?Thank you very much.

A few days after my cleaning, I started developing the bad taste again. It is not as bad as it used to be, although I do still have an off taste, particularly in the morning.

On the one hand, I'm afraid to have the area worked on too much, but, if the filling is causing a problem, I don't want it to go unchecked. I feel like the dental office is milking this situation by having me come in for so many visits. I have already paid quite a bit of money to have the filling redone, to have x-rays retaken (they claim to have lost the ones on file), and my upcoming visit to correct the filling would cost me as well.

I would still very much appreciate any advice as to whether the work would be beneficial, but did want to clarify that point.Thank you. dental_care: Even though the procedure happened ten days ago, gum tissue healing can take longer, especially if irritated or exposed to bacteria. The bad taste could be due to leftover tissue debris, food particles trapped in the area, or slight inflammation. Peeling back gum tissue can cause temporary irritation, even with proper care. This irritation could contribute to the bad taste you're experiencing. Other factors such as dry mouth, certain medications, or sinus issues can also contribute to a bad taste in the mouth. Gum tissue healing varies depending on individual factors and the extent of the procedure. While ten days is significant, full healing can take several weeks. If the bad taste doesn't significantly improve within two weeks or worsens, consulting your dentist for further evaluation is recommended.

I was actually just going to post another question related to my last dental appointment. I went back 2.5 weeks ago to have the excess overhang removed from the filling. While there, I expressed my concern at having the filling worked on so many times, and my unhappiness with this persistent bad taste. After correcting the filling, the dentist told me for the first time that I had a 6-7 mm periodontal pocket behind my tooth, and he thought that was the source of the bad taste. I never had an issue with any pocket there before, and am wondering if putting in the new filling could have caused or worsened a pocket.The dentist proceeded to do a deep cleaning of the tooth, told me to keep it clean and see a periodontist if I had further problems. Since then, I've been diligent about my hygiene routine. I brush in the morning, followed by Listerine. After lunch, I oil pull with coconut oil, then brush. I do a saltwater rinse in the afternoon. Then, after dinner, I brush, floss, use a water flosser and more Listerine. My taste is still off, which concerns me, although it is better than it was before the deep cleaning.My hope is to try and shrink the pockets somewhat these next few weeks with proper home care. I've read that pockets in the 4-5 mm range can be treated with routine dental cleanings. My plan, at this point, is to visit a new dentist in another month or so to assess where I'm at and see what he recommends. Any advice as to how to proceed would be much appreciated."

I’m not seeing any difference on how their jaw looks like (that they shrunk etc) and they can just eat without any trouble (at least from those I have asked) which confuses me because I read online that if you don’t get an implant you will loose bone etc and it’s not good for you. Or maybe it’s not THAT bad but having dental implant is just better? Dr M: A dental implant definitely helps to retain bone in the area. Although function can remain unaffected, because we are very adaptable, you would definitely see some bone loss in the mouths of your colleagues, if you follow-up with x-rays. flomodental: Considering the consequences of not getting an implant after missing a tooth is important. While it may seem minor, not replacing a missing tooth can lead to various dental problems. The adjacent and opposing teeth can shift, causing bite misalignment and jaw pain. It can also lead to bone loss in the jaw and affect the overall facial structure. FloMo Dental offers a range of solutions for missing teeth, including dental crowns, dentures, and dental implants. These options can help prevent the potential complications of not replacing a missing tooth. We recommend consulting a dental professional to discuss the best treatment plan for your needs. dental_care: There's a difference between \"better\" and \"necessary\" when it comes to dental implants. While both sides have valid points, the decision ultimately depends on individual circumstances and priorities. Benefits of Dental Implants include preserving jaw bones, preventing shifting teeth, improving aesthetics and functions, and durability.The only consideration is implants are typically the most expensive tooth replacement option, with several procedures and materials involved. Dental bridges and dentures can be less expensive alternatives to implants."

    "title": "Please help pain in bottom front teeth",
    "dialogue": "Kr222: Hello, I really need some advice. I have been having a dull aching pain that has remained pretty much constant for over a year in a bottom tooth. I’m not sure which number the tooth is. the pain feels like it’s almost always in one particular tooth, however on some days it seems to radiate to a few of my other bottom teeth. I had the tooth x rayed many times, and no dentist seems to have an answer for me. They say the x Ray is normal every time. I even consulted with a periodontist and had a scaling done to make sure it wasnt gum related. But no change. I don’t know what to do. This pain has severely affected my quality of life, and the worst part is that there seems to be no end to in sight. The pain does seem to be less when I wake up in the morning, and steadily increases throughout the day the more I talk, chew, and just go about normal activities. Would anyone be kind enough to share if maybe they had something similar? Or any possible idea what i should do next? Could it be that my pain is not dental related and this is some type of neuralgia? I attached an X-ray for review. Any advice would be so much appreciated and would mean so much to me. Thank you in advance. honestdoc: I'm suspecting you may be grinding and clenching.  Are you experiencing stress before the pain started and is still unresolved?  Did you have any trauma around the area and to your jaws?  Your roots don't look like you had orthodontic treatment.  Try an Over-the-counter bite guard and if you notice some improvement, try for a custom guard your dentist needs to make. Kr222: I suspect the same but I know I’m not grinding/clenching during the day, if anything it would be only at night. So if that’s the case would the pain be nearly constant the way it is? I can’t seem to get much relief. I will definitely try a night guard. Also, I actually did have orthodontic work.To be honest, this daily pain definitely has been stressing me out. I can’t remember being overly stressed before this started though.I can vaguely recall a possible trauma when biting really hard on a peice of gauze after a molar removal and feeling a very sharp pain, but this pain feels like it’s coming from a tooth more toward the front of my mouth and the gauze was toward the back. (Sorry if this sounds a little bit crazy. I’m just trying so hard to figure this out)Thank you so much for the fast and thoughtful response. It really means so much to me! honestdoc: Fortunately after orthodontic work, your roots did not appear too shortened.  I suspect you have a stressful job or some unresolved stress.  You do not notice yourself grinding and clenching.  According to experts, your teeth only touch 20 minutes a day including all meals and function.  The rest of the time, the teeth are about 0.5 cm (0.25 inch) apart.  This allows the jaws to rest and the teeth to minimize contact trauma.  From my 20 years observations, this is the most likely scenario. Did you have any trauma to your jaws?  I've attended a lecture from Dr. Jeffrey Okeson from the University of Kentucky and he treats unexplained dental pain.  One of the factors is trauma such as an auto accident affecting the lower back.  There are nerve centers that can refer to the jaws.  I don't think this applies to you. Kr222: That does make sense, except that the tooth (sometimes teeth) that hurts is/ are out of occlusion which is why clenching/grinding was originally ruled out by the dentist. I guess I should have probably mentioned that earlier. The only teeth that touch each other when I bite are my back molars..Never had trauma to the jaw, no serious accidents. I’m very concerned about the potential possibility that this is some sort of neuralgia, as was mentioned a few times when my dentist was unable to figure this out. Do you think this could be the case? Does this type of pain in front teeth seem typical of an neuralgia? I REALLY hope not. honestdoc: I have lower front teeth out of occlusion as well.  The consequence will usually be hypereruption.  Another possibility is possible crowding.  According to an oral surgeon during an audience participation, there was an Iowa study that suggested lower wisdom teeth pushing the anterior teeth to crowding.  This suggestion was previously thought as a myth.  I wear a bite guard to minimize lower anterior hypereruption as well as my grinding and it helped tremendously.  This may be expensive but a custom bite guard may possibly help you as well. Kr222: I had my wisdom teeth out on that side (left side) both top and bottom. I will try the night guard. Thank you again for the response it’s very much appreciated John Roberts: I am facing sort of the same thing you are going through except it is most all my teeth.  The front top and bottom being the worst.  Been going on since 11/16.  Dentist can see anything wrong.  It does feel like my bite is off but I don't think it is bad enough to make all my teeth hurt like this.  A neurologist says I have Trigemial Nerulgia but I am not sure about it.  It is like I have to go with the diagnosis because I can't find out anything else.  He is treating me with medicine so I don't know. I also have pain in my eyes sometime, my nose sometime and my neck most of the time.  Going for a MRI of brain and neck.  I am miserable I know that.  Let us know if you go find out anything. honestdoc: I'm not a neural expert.  I believe that the hoof beats we are hearing now are not horses but may be zebra(s).  I can not explain your constant pain for over a year.  One very remote possibility is viral like oral herpes (cold sore).  Approximately 70% of people have this virus and it lives in the nerve tracts.  A virus expert says that viruses are protected in nerve tissue because the body cannot attack its own nerves.  I may be going off tangent but I can't think of anything but brainstorming.  Another remote possibility is saliva stones.  It can be picked up on radiographic images.  I'm sure all the dentists or doctors found no cysts/tumors/disease.  If you exhausted all of your options, Dr. Jeffrey Okeson in Lexington Kentucky is the foremost authority on unexplained dental pain. John Roberts: Sorry I haven't answered back.  I have never had a cold sore that I know of.  I know since  I have been having this trouble it seems like I put out a tremendous amount of saliva.  As soon as I get up in the morning it seems to start.  I have read about how much a normal amount is and I think I have way more than that.  Sometime I drool.  Didn't used to do that.  As far as my teeth they touch every time I swallow.  That is what hurts because most all of my teeth are so sensitive.  \nI have had several radio graphic x rays done by several different dentist and one oral surgeon and they have said nothing.  I have told most of them my bite doesn't feel right.  I had a sleep study to see if i grind my teeth which I didn't.  They said I have mild sleep apena.  I don't snore and my wife says she has never heard me grind my teeth.  I have been to doctors, periodontist, orthodontist, neurologist and I don't know how many dentist.  I have been told three things.  A neuro musucalar dentist wanted to do some type of tens treatment and make a mouthpiece for 8,500. He didn't give me any kind of clear diagnose I felt. I have been to two neuroloigist.  One had a brain scan done and told me my problem was dental.  I went to neurolighta a month and a half ago and he told me I have trigeminal neuralgia which I don't really think I have but these are the three diagnoses i have had besides I don't know.  I have told more than one of them my bite seems like it changes.  It will feel like one tooth is high then it will feel like a differnet one is high or rubbing another one.  It changes.  I have been told I don't have TMJ.  I have had CT scans of face and TMJ joints.  I am still looking for answers.  Any suggestions appreciated.  I am too old for this.  It is making my life miserable most of the time.  At night is my best time.  Doesn't bother me at night.  I sleep with a over the counter night guard sometime.

Did you manage to find the cause of the pain? dental_care: There can be several possible causes of your pain. Although X-rays might not always show hairline cracks, they can still cause persistent pain that worsens with activity. Sinus infection, pain in the upper jaw can sometimes radiate to the lower teeth, mimicking dental pain. Seek a second or even third opinion from a dental professional, preferably an endodontist specializing in tooth pain diagnosis and treatment. When describing your pain to the dentist, mention all the associated symptoms, like the pain radiating to other teeth, increasing with activity, and time of day variations. If X-rays haven't been conclusive, discuss the possibility of getting a CT scan or MRI to get a more detailed view of the area."

    "dialogue": "nkoyhope: As someone who struggled with crooked teeth for years, finding a solution that could  straighten my smile seemed like impossible because I couldn’t afford braces. Until I discovered Mouth Guard, a product designed to not only protect teeth but also gradually align them for a more confident smile. In this review, I'll share my personal experience with this mouth guard and how it has transformed my oral health and appearance.My Experience:From the moment I started using the Mouth Guard, I noticed a significant improvement in my teeth alignment. The three stage correction system, featuring braces of varying hardness, provided gentle yet consistent pressure on my teeth, gradually guiding them into proper alignment.Nighttime Protection:One of the standout features of the Mouth Guard is its ability to protect teeth during nighttime grinding or clenching. Made of soft, comfortable material, wearing this mouth guard not only prevented tooth wear but also eliminated the disruptive sound of grinding teeth, allowing me to enjoy a peaceful night's sleep.Comfort and Convenience:I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable the Mouth Guard is to wear. Its lightweight design and tongue positioning feature (Mewing) helped me maintain proper alignment and avoid misalignment, all while being convenient to use whether at home or while traveling.Results:After several months of consistent use, I am thrilled with the results I've achieved with the Mouth Guard. My teeth are noticeably straighter, and I feel more confident than ever about my smile. The gradual correction process has been gentle yet effective, and I couldn't be happier with the outcome.Final Thoughts:In conclusion, the Mouth Guard has exceeded my expectations in every way. Not only has it protected my teeth from nighttime grinding, but it has also played a crucial role in straightening my smile. If you're struggling with crooked teeth like I was, I highly recommend giving this  mouth guard a try. It's truly been a gamechanger for me, and I'm confident it can make a difference for you too.https://amzn.to/3SIFrtC"

I initially started getting what appeared to be lie bumps, but then th condition worsened to a white tongue and pain and then late last year, this ring on the inner of my left gum. I Do have a small white area on my right side too, but it isn’t a ring. I also have white rings like this on my tongue (not the white patch on my tongue). They have been a bit yellow ish in the past. I am not sure if I have geographic tongue, oral lichen planus or oral thrush. I don’t know what to do. Been to dr several times and oral specialist has denied me saying it’s geographic tongue but I’m in pain and it doesn’t seem to look like geographic tongue. I am unsure if geographic tongue can even on the gums as well? I’ve had two oral swabs done which showed no signs of yeast and tried many drugs for oral thrush (nilstat, decozol, flucanazole, daktarin, fungalin-which helped my white tongue oddly and then it came back again once stopping and oil pulling) to no avail. I believe more thrush To be my problem, because at one point I had angular chelitis and red rashes on my legs. The red rashes were cured with flucanazol. This made me think it was thrush?"

My gum on that side is hurting so is jaw. I was so nervous not sure if numbing injection was placed there or inner gum. That area also feels more bumpy then other side. I cannot eat anything as its painful and sensitive. Please help. This is where i previosly had amaglam filling and now its been treplaced by white im not sure if its just been covered or replaced. But tjis filling was not as deep as the other but hurts more. Last image is the tooth last week, so you can compare. Thanks Dr M: Sometimes there is some sensitivity that is present after drilling on a tooth for a few days, but it should then disappear. The bite should also be checked to make sure the filling is not too high. You can try applying some Sensodyne toothpaste on the tooth. Rub it on for a minute and then leave it on, and don't rinse it off with water. \nDo you have any x-rays of the associated teeth? aqz: Hi,\nNo i do not have xrays may i ask why they are needed?  The pain has calmed down abit today however when touching jaw in that area its still sore and im not eating much as its still sensitive. My question is the tiny white area is that just bone or something else under tooth on gum? Dr M: Might be calculus, which can be cleaned off, or it could just be some demineralization. Difficult to see clearly on the photos. The x-rays might give an idea of how deep the fillings really are as well as the quality of the fillings. aqz: Ok thanks for your replies they have been very informative and helpful. Thank you"

So it's invisible to everyone else, and the glue or Poly-[A]crylic-[A]cid is leaking out and gumming up my teeth and getting on my hands, hair and skin and then polymerizing with things like graphene and gluten, making me a walking Christmas Tree antenna. You could ask them to redo the sealant. My dentist didn't charge anything that time because they knew this was bugging me for so long. That will make it smooth again, but in my case, you can't guarantee that when it's fragmented like Mount Rushmore, it won't get abraded by food more and break down further, becoming rough again. That's what happened 5 days later, but that's because I didn't have a complete restoration, to make the whole surface smooth and resistant to food again. With my warm-heart and good-luck,\n: Joseph."

(My fault, I waited so long because I'm terrified of the dentist) but because of my insurance, there's one oral surgery place that will accept me and its 5 hrs away and a veryyyy long waiting list.\nThe last few weeks I have had infection after infection. The first time I was given clydamycin and it helped the infection on the left side but on day 3 of that antibiotic I had an infection start on my right side so they switched me to amox. I finished the 10 day dose and was fine for a week, a week later I start experiencing pain again so I go to the doctor(dentist appt is scheduled but not for another week) they give me amox again but so far I'm on day 5 and I haven't gotten any kind of relief and starting to wonder if it's spread to my jaw? My jaw bone is so tender and hurts bad. I have plenty of clindamycin left over from the first time, can I try that until my dentist appt if the amox isn't working?? Dr M: You usually do extensive testing in order to determine antibiotic resistance. I don't think you need to worry about that. The problem is that antibiotics is never a solution to any problem and a lot of times your wisdom teeth can cause pain without having an associated bacterial infection. It is more inflammation leading to the pain and therefore it might be better to consider using anti-inflammatory meds ( keep in mind the gastric effects). I would suggest seeking another oral surgeon or even a dentist with experience in oral surgery to see if they can remove the wisdom tooth/teeth sooner. This is the only real solution."

    "dialogue": "allie_989: Hello,I was just looking for some advice. I have been experiencing sore, inflamed, bleeding gums for a little while now. I also have recession on some teeth. I use a salt water rinse twice a day, I use coconut oil for oil pulling for twenty minutes every morning, I use a Philips Sonic toothbrush twice a day, I use dental tape twice a day, a dental stick for those hard to reach areas at the back of my molars and an Aloe Vera and tea tree mouthwash. And despite all of this, I still have painful gums. I am at my wits ends. I am trying to do everything right but it feels like I am doing everything wrong. I also wear a mouth guard at night due to clenching. The gum at the edges of some of my teeth are red and sore looking, bleeding easily upon flossing. Sometimes, flavours (spicy, citrus, etc.) can also irritate my gums. I just don't know what to do. I use to take pride in my healthy gums and somehow, it feels like I'm messing everything up.Kindest regards,Alice Dr M: Good dayHave you seen a dentist recently? Has he referred you to a periodontist? allie_989: I saw a Hygienist last September and was given some tips, which I have followed. I have a dentist appointment booked for February 15th, I have contacted my practice to check for cancellations but there have not been any. alithedentalguy: Hi Alice,Hope you are doing fine. In such cases, the usual recommendation is to have deep cleaning at the first place. Following the deep cleaning regular cleaning that you can do at home should be enough. However, they should also find out the reason of the inflamation and the bleeding. Please keep me updated regarding your situation.Kind regards,Ali"

It's an auto-immune response.  Have you started any medications, herbals, supplements, toothpaste, oral rinse, been sick, and or had stress?  Usually it will go away once the source is resolved. soqrates: hello doctor i have had an ulcer and kept thinking that it was cancer andmy thinking  put me into too much anxiety and all these white lines come when i had the ulcer but the ulcer is getting better but  its not completely healed  it been 20 days for that ulcer in my lips not completely healed but it did put me in stress anxiety and so and to be  honest these while lines  appear  after the ulcer  showed up i do not take any medications, honestdoc: Hopefully, your autoimmune response will go away on its own.  If you are having discomfort or pain, have your dentist consider oral corticosteroid like Triamcinolone in Dental Paste. soqrates: im really sorry asking too many question doctor but i always have fear of caner and so \ncould this Lichen Planus. causes fever cuz since i get them i always have fever and  i feel my gums swollen  \nand is it normal for ulcer not completely heal it been 21 days for the ulcer not completely healed honestdoc: Your body doesn't develop cancer very easily unless you have the genes and risk factors.  An expert once mentioned that your body fights off cancer developing cells everyday.  If you have the genes and risk factors such as tobacco use, those daily cancer cells can potentially overwhelm the body.  This is a daily struggle.  It is best to eliminate those risk factors.It is unusual for ulcer to not heal after 21 days.  It is best to visit your dentist to evaluate the reasons.  Lichen planus does not cause a fever but it may be correlated due to altered immune response.  Take care of what's ailing you and it should go away. soqrates: doctor today where i live all dentist are closed i went to general doctor who told me its from ur teeth and ent said the same but they telling me the this is scar from the ulcer it not an ulcer and it can take up to 6 weeks to  heal can u plz take a look first picture when i had the ulcer  \nsecond picture its how it looks right now honestdoc: It looks like an aphthous ulceration (stomatitis).  It normally goes away in 7-10 days.  Do you have any immune compromised conditions such as diabetes, acquired immune deficiencies, congenital, etc.? Ask you doctor or dentist to prescribe you Triamcinolone (Kenalog) in Dental Paste and apply with a Q-tip to the sore about 3 times a day. soqrates: hello doctor sorry for the late replay not i dont have any disease the white line is now much better then before but the ulcer not getting better yet this is how its looks now  i dont know if its getting better or not i didnt go dentist yet my appointment after 2moro and im really scared . honestdoc: The ulceration looks like it is getting better.  It usually goes away in 7 to 10 days. soqrates: hello doctor im really sorry i keep bothering u im just scared and i have no clue what to doi went to dentist today and he said that i have to go to a mouth disease doctor to make full check up on that ulcer if it didnt go in 14 daysi have  very dry mouth crack lips  burning sensation in my lips and tongue\nthis is how the ulcer looks now do u think its cancer doctor? or just this ulcer taking slow time to heal honestdoc: It looks like it is healing.  You must be under a lot of stress and your body's immune response is stressed as well.  Get Triamcinolone in dental paste from your doctor/dentist.It is not cancer.  If you are a smoker or use tobacco, quit ASAP. soqrates: hello doctor how are u today im sorry again to bother u   today i want to 2 different dentist and the first one said if the ulcer dont go in 2 weeks i have to go back to him and he will send me to to a place where they make full check up on it to make sure its just an ulcer second doctor said this ulcer is healed but  it can some times take more time to heal depend on the cause of the ulcer  if its heat from stomach it heals within 2 weeks if its a bite or food cut  it can take more then month to heal i have got another ulcer in my mouth cheek which i showed him and showed him the white lines he said its new ulcer looks normal and the white lines could be fungles  i showed him the old picture and i told him that how was big it is and he said if this was cancer it would never become smaller or even healed a bit it would go worse then that and he told me to buy these medicine flagyl 250 its for the stomach + mycost is a gel for fungles   now i am really confused sir what would u advice me to do  im having very dry lips and cheek  pain  little not  very painfull in my top lips and bottom lips where ulcer is but not very painful  and burning sensation on  my tongue  pain in my gum i eat normal no diarrhea sometime  fever that comes and go honestdoc: Where are you located? soqrates: im, from jordan middle east honestdoc: You may have to go to a larger city with more resources.  The medication I mentioned numerous times may not be available in smaller communities. soqrates: hello doctor how are u im sorry again for bothering u \ni have tried to find that medicine u told me about no luck i couldn't find it   i took antibiotic on my own and so but its still there i want ur opinion  please this ulcer u know it was big in painfull now 0 pain it does not hurt but it get stuck in my front teeth  like i feel my skin stuck in there i dont know if this stoping it from healing i dont know its healed or got better from before \nits been now 1month and 16 days im very well not unwell i eat fine not sick or losing wight  can u plz advice me what to do  shall i make lab test or no need or just give it more time  here is the new pictures for it please let me know if its got better or worse really i dont know how to thank you doctor for been helping me all this time <3 honestdoc: The lesion is your body's autoimmune response.  Antibiotic will not cure it because it is not bacteria related.  You shouldn't take antibiotics on your own because bacteria will get resistant to it when you need it the most.  You need to have a doctor's prescription.  Please, if you want my advice, then  follow it.

So instead of renewing my crowns he popped my existing crowns off and replaced both in composite bonding the price was the same as it took so long.He said that if they fail or crack he will replace at his cost with crowns.Aesthetically I’m amazed my teeth look perfect much better than I imagine crowns could ever look on my front teeth.I’m super worried about them failing especially when he hasn’t given me a time frame for replacing them if they do fail. So much that I had myself in tears over it I’m scared to eat anything that isn’t soft. He has assured me that it is safe to do so but I just can’t help but worry.I have always fully trusted my dentist I’ve been with him for 10 years and I moved 2.5 hours away and travel to him after trying a few others that I didn’t feel were upto standard.Am I being silly and worrying over nothing?Looking for other peoples opinions on this and if anyone has had the same done and it’s been fine?Also k should mention it’s a private clinic not nhs"

I am afraid it is yet another cracked root...which would mean the tooth has to be extracted.Recent (2023) history:Early June: Molar #46 cracked noticeably, and superficially\nEarly July: X-rays yielded no anamolies\nLate July: Bonded\nMid Aug: Bonding broke and permanent toothache set in\nLate Aug: Bonding restored, pain getting worse\nEarly Sept: Referred to endodontist  who performed X-ray and CBCT scan: X-ray clean, CBCT scan indicates rarefying osteitis...and possibly fractures.\nEarly Oct: 4 root canals (phase 1), pain increases two days later substantially (headache added)\nEarly/mid Dec (11 weeks later): another X-ray confirmed ongoing lesion at root apex. I decided not to have #46 obdurated.\nMid Dec: Molar #46 extracted by oral surgeon, who confirmed crack in root. Biting on that black rubber puck for 1-2 hours may have affected the ligaments...It has not been three weeks...Bottom line: RCT was unnecessary as CBCT scan did not have the resolution to image the \"lethal\" root fractures. Root fractures obviously constitute a problem with diagnosis.The potential problem with unambiguous diagnosis of the incisor: imaging may not reveal root fracture AND rarefying osteitis. How do I avoid another unnecessary RCT?If it is a sprained tooth, there would obviously be no rarefying osteitis.I may try a nightguard first."

The pain is sharp and sudden, and happens randomly throughout the day. \nI’ve been to the dentist countless times and they can’t find anything obvious, so have referred me to the orthodontist for a full X-ray. The last dentist I saw said the gum above UL4 looks a darker shade and I may need a root canal if it continues.However, the pain I’m feeling the majority of the time is coming from UL7.I have a phobia of the dentist in general so this is doing nothing for my anxiety, please help MattJ:  Dr M: Due to the fact that you have a missing molar, your remaining 2nd molar has tilted to try and close the gap. This might have influenced your occlusion or the way you \"bite\" on your teeth. Unnecessary pressure could lead to this type of pain. I would suggest also maybe checking the occlusion on this molar and filing down any high spots. dental_care: The full X-ray your orthodontist has ordered is likely to be very helpful in identifying the source of your pain. Different teeth can sometimes refer pain to other areas, so UL7 might not be the culprit even if you feel the pain there most. Having a clear picture of all the teeth in the upper left quadrant will be crucial for accurate diagnosis."

I've also heard that it can change your face shape.\nI had experiences in my life where I've done myself a disfavour by excessive health care, and I don't want to repeat these mistakes.

You've already had gum infection once, and that means (and shows on Xray) that there is a likely communication with bacteria from your mouth. Sure, you're going OK now and prob in fairly good health.\nBut in 40 years time when you're in on multiple medications because of multiple medical issues, you'll be at much higher risk of developing wisdom teeth problems, you'll be medically harder to manage for the oral surgeon, and you won't heal so well, so that's not something you'll want. And what guarantees are there that you'll be able to maintain your teeth as well as you do now? You might have arthritis, dementia, ... possibly in a nursing home.\nMy father had a major stroke at age 63 and in the next 6 months before he died, I don't think nursing staff ever brushed his teeth AT ALL. He developed pneumonia and that took him out; I still wonder if part of that was related to the non-existent dental care he received.\nGo to an oral surgeon now for opinion and good talk about risks at this stage in your life as opposed to later in life. If you were 20 years younger I'd do you in my general practice, but now you're almost 40 and the adjacent lower molars have had some nice RCTs.\n... and your face shape doesn't change after taking out wisdoms.

Najmidental99: Najmi Dental impacted wisdom teeth, I understand the discomfort and concerns this issue can bring. It's essential to consult with a qualified dentist to address this problem effectively. In some cases, impacted wisdom teeth might affect surrounding teeth or cause pain, necessitating extraction.If anyone in the Fairfield area is seeking professional advice or assistance, I highly recommend considering a consultation with a reputable cosmetic dentist in Fairfield. They can provide tailored solutions and guidance to manage impacted wisdom teeth while considering aesthetic concerns. dental_care: 1. Remove all of them: This would eliminate the risk of future problems, such as pain, infection, damage to other teeth, and cysts.Drawbacks: This is the most invasive option and carries the highest risk of complications, such as nerve damage, bleeding, and dry sockets. It can also be the most expensive option.2. Remove only the bottom two: This would address the immediate concern of the lower wisdom teeth potentially causing problems.Drawbacks: The upper wisdom teeth could still cause problems in the future, requiring additional surgery later. This option may not be feasible if the upper wisdom teeth are difficult to access.3. Leave them be: This avoids the risks and costs of surgery.Drawbacks: There is a risk of developing problems in the future, such as pain, infection, damage to other teeth, and cysts. These problems can be more difficult and expensive to treat than preventive removal."

If there are cavities, these teeth can be fixed with fillings. If your child is grinding, unfortunately the teeth can be fixed with fillings, but there is a high chance of fracturing again, because baby teeth shift and move constantly as your child grows, leading to periods of grinding and not grinding respectively.\nThe dentist does not sound like he is informing you properly.

It can cause teeth to appear white, chalky, or translucent and be more prone to chipping and wearing.\nNutritional deficiencies: Deficiencies in calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus can affect tooth development and make them weaker.\nAcid erosion: Frequent exposure to acidic drinks or foods like citrus fruits or soda can erode the enamel."

Of all my teeth it's the one I notice the most for no reason at all and here and there if I were to put my hand on my chin or press on my face I can feel the \"pressure\" to an extent.Back when it first happened I was insanely paranoid of that tooth and wondering if it was at risk of falling out or something. It's never felt loose or moved out of place though and literally a week after I noticed it I went into the dentist, had a deep scaling (so a lot of scraping and pressure to that tooth which led to nothing happening to it) and they didn't mention any risks at all during a dental examination. Went to an orthodontist for a braces consultation last month and they weren't giving me much concern either about any of my teeth so that's literally 2/2 with professionals not being alarmed.My anxiety is still really focused on this tooth however and I have no idea to describe what my concern is. I start my braces treatment this week and I just can't help but to have these irrational fears my tooth is gonna fall out from the pressure of braces or something lmao. It'd really put me at ease if I could at least figure out what this is. I heard it's possible to have tooth sensitivity after bruxism/clenching which I used to have, though it literally only happened to my back molars and I can't see how I'd be feeling it more with my canine. I had the scaling so maybe some type of root exposure or just overall thing with the gums I have to deal with? kaelaburns: How is everything going with this now for you?

    "dialogue": "Liliana:  Dr M: Patient can be treated in chair as normal if co-operative, under sedation if not co-operative, or in theater under general anaesthesia.\nWhat exactly do you need to know? John Morgens: When treating a patient in pediatric dentistry, here are some tips and considerations:1. Create a kid-friendly space: Design the dental office to be welcoming and comfortable for children, with colorful decor, toys, and child-sized furniture.2. Use language children can understand: Use age-appropriate language and explanations to communicate with young patients, avoiding complex dental terminology.3. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos to help children understand dental procedures and oral hygiene instructions.4. Provide preventive care: Regular cleanings and preventive care, such as fluoride treatments and sealants, are essential for maintaining children's oral health.5. Practice effective behavior guidance: Use behavior guidance techniques recommended by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) to create a positive and comfortable experience for the child.6. Be patient and understanding: Understand that children may feel anxious or fearful during dental visits. Take the time to listen to their concerns and address them with empathy.Remember, treating pediatric dental patients requires a gentle and patient approach. By creating a child-friendly environment, using appropriate language and visual aids, providing preventive care, and practicing effective behavior guidance, you can ensure a positive and successful dental experience for young patients. MattKW: See attached. This is what I used to do. hardyoakfamilydentistry: Treating a patient in pediatric dentistry involves specialized care to address the unique needs and concerns of children. Here is a general guide on how to approach pediatric dental treatment:\nEstablish Trust:\nBegin by creating a friendly and welcoming environment to help the child feel at ease. Build trust by introducing yourself, explaining procedures in a child-friendly manner, and addressing any fears or concerns.Age-Appropriate Communication:\nUse language and communication styles suitable for the child's age. Explain procedures in simple terms, avoiding dental jargon. Encourage questions and provide reassurance throughout the appointment.Show and Tell:\nUse visual aids such as models, pictures, or child-friendly dental tools to demonstrate procedures. This helps children understand what to expect and reduces anxiety.Preventive Care Education:\nEducate both the child and their parents about the importance of preventive dental care, including proper brushing, flossing, and a healthy diet. Emphasize the role of regular dental check-ups.Treatment Planning:\nDevelop a treatment plan tailored to the child's dental needs. Discuss the plan with the parents, explaining the urgency of certain treatments and addressing any concerns they may have.Dental Sealants and Fluoride Applications:\nConsider preventive measures like dental sealants and fluoride applications to protect the child's teeth from decay. Explain the benefits of these treatments to parents.Follow-Up and Monitoring:\nSchedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor the child's oral health and track any ongoing treatments. Provide guidance on at-home care and address any new concerns that may arise.Always approach pediatric dentistry with patience, empathy, and a child-centered focus to create a positive and comfortable experience for both the child and their parents."

    "title": "Still feeling pain after root canal treatment",
    "dialogue": "Dentist90: Last year in December I had issues with my molar. A part of the molar broke off, it was cracked below the gumline and it was also infected. My dentist told me that I could do a root canal treatment or go for extraction. I decided to choose the root canal treatment in January to see if it could be saved. My dentist also did a filling fix for the part of the teeth that broke off. The molar looks good from the outside but it’s a bit loose compared to my other tooth. The loose part is not an issue for me but the fact it’s 10 months later and I sometimes still feel pain. It’s not severe but I still feel pain like sharp stabs inside, sometimes a tiny bit of pounding and as if it’s inflamed (not that it’s really inflamed but it’s similar to when you cut your finger and it’s healing and when you put water on it it’s still a bit sensitive). I went to the dentist in September because the pain was more severe than usual and it seemed liked it caused a mild panic attack which freaked me out which is why I made an appointment. I had two mild panic attacks (or at least symptoms you get after having a panic attack) after that but I’m not sure if they were related to the pain or if I was going to negative thoughts and stress or it was a mix of everything. I have a feeling that it was because of the pain but I can’t be sure. After I visited the dentist the pain disappeared for like a few weeks but now I’m dealing with pain again. When I went to my dentist in September and my dental hygienist in October they both said that I should wait first to see how it will go and that it’s normal to feel the pain because I had a root canal treatment. Sometimes I feel down and as if my body isn’t responding well to the pain like it’s tired of it. I don’t know what to do and it’s making me feel sad. Can a molar that is broken off below a gumline be saved? Dr M: Do you have a post treatment x-ray of the tooth, so that we can make informed comments? Dentist90: Hi, I went to dentist Chris yesterday who performed the root canal treatment with dentist Emma (my “original” dentist) in January. Emma needed help so Chris helped her and he is also the practice owner. Chris didn’t make a new photo but looked at the old one that was made in September by dentist Andrew because at that time dentist Emma was on maternity leave. I wanted to make an appointment as soon as possible and Chris was available and did part of the root canal treatment which is why I went to him. Chris gave me antibiotics and said that I should wait first to see how it will go. I should take the antibiotics for 7 days. If I still have pain after 6 months - 1 year from now, he might take other steps. I still feel weird physically… I’m not sure if it’s because of the teeth or because I’m just sick in general or a mix of both so I took a few days off from work to rest. (The names I used aren’t real names but fake ones so it’s less confusing to explain my situation)."

My question is I’m 4 days post surgery and my dentist and the assistants all said that having pain after surgery is normal, but what about if it’s a throbbing sensation that comes and goes but it’s not excruciating? Is that normal? derekgatta: A throbbing sensation post-surgery is pretty normal as your gums heal. It's likely part of the recovery process.

Not sure what this is MattKW: Doesn't make much sense. Wait and see. DariaMerritt00: Tooth extraction problems refer to complications or issues that can arise during or after the removal of a tooth. These problems can include pain, bleeding, infection, damage to surrounding tissues, difficulty in healing, or complications with anesthesia. It's essential to follow post-extraction care instructions and consult with a dentist or oral surgeon if any of these problems occur to ensure proper treatment and recovery. alakuni: Tooth extraction can be a cause of stress and misgiving. It's normal to have a concerned outlook on potential issues that might emerge during or after the strategy.A few normal issues following tooth extraction incorporate torment, enlarging, and dying, which can trouble. Diseases, dry attachment (a difficult condition where the blood coagulation is lost), and harm to adjoining teeth or tissues can likewise be personal worries.It's fundamental to discuss straightforwardly with your dental specialist about any concerns or fears you might have. They can give direction on the best way to limit chances and guarantee a smooth recuperation. Keep in mind, you're in good company to confront these difficulties, and with the right consideration and backing, you can explore through them and safeguard your oral wellbeing.

My dentist recommended an implant, but I have a severe phobia, and I'm a smoker on medication, which could affect the implant. I’ve read studies suggesting that resin-bonded bridges (RBBs) are a viable alternative with success rates of 82-91% over 5-10 years, but dentists I’ve consulted don't recommend them. MattKW: Meta-analyses can be confusing with all the variables. Your deep bite might complicate both RBB and implant success. A cantilever RBB could work for a central incisor. Consult a prosthodontist experienced with RBBs. joey87: I’m thinking of using orthodontics to move tooth #11 forward to create space for an RBB. I’m worried about the duration of orthodontic treatment and whether a general dentist or orthodontist should manage this. MattKW: Orthodontics might be a good option. Moving #11 forward could take around 6 months. General dentists with orthodontic experience can handle simpler cases, but a specialist might offer better results. Ensure the orthodontist or general dentist considers the occlusion and materials for the RBB. joey87: I’ve found a local clinic that prefers EMAX material over Zirconia and recommends a two-wing design. They are hesitant about orthodontics due to the potential need for a fixed retainer wire. I live in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, and there’s a long wait for a specialist. MattKW: EMAX is a good choice, and a two-wing design is an option. If the clinic isn't recommending orthodontics, a fixed retainer might be a consideration. You may need to go with their recommendations or wait for a specialist if possible. joey87: Thanks for the advice. I’ll weigh these options and follow up with the clinic."

I’ve seen a second dentist for a second opinion he said it didn’t look infected,did a cold text I screamed.  it’s close to my nerve but it could be an irritation sensitivity issue. If it doesn’t go away, root canal or extraction, I have very bad anxiety with dentist and I went to see an oral surgeon and she will not work on me due to my heart condition and it’s close to my sinus cavity. She said if I want to tooth out have to go get it extracted at the hospital where they would put me to sleep she said it didn’t look affected either from the x-ray, but none of them looked at my mouth , it’s an annoying ache like pressure. The sensitivity seems to be not with hot and I could drink some cold things but the pain won’t go away like the dull ache pain. Is there a chance that the sensitivity could get better or is there a root canal in the future?"

It is best to go to a dentist, even if not your friend, to get it checked out. Depending on the angle of the photo, it could be a opening of a duct of your salivary gland ( stenson's duct), which is a normal anatomical feature, and it might be that you only focused on it now. This feature is usually bilateral, although in your photo, it is situated a bit more to the back than one would usually suspect.\nAnother possibility could be that is maybe related to a previous trauma like cheek biting, that you did not realise or a sharp piece of filling or tooth that is irritating a piece of your cheek tissue.\nIt is very difficult to judge from a photo alone without a proper clinical examination.\nObserve the lesion.\nIf it becomes painful or enlarges, it is important to go and let it be checked out.\nIf not, you can always mention it during your next routine dental visit. stosha0622: What was it?

That’s why I wonder if I could instead of all that just remove the other lateral incisor than fix the gap with braces like I said. Will this cause any health problems? Muhammad Danial Ashraf: Hello melvin hope you are doing great. \nYour point is valid but before that you have to consider few things regarding your teeth anatomy. Each tooth looks different in shape. If you notice your teeth, central are different in shape then laterals or canines. So just removing lateral incisor will not fully solve your problems. If your dentist thinks that your lateral incisors gaps are well enough for closing and maintaining the normal horizontal overlap between upper and lower incisors then you can go with one tooth extraction. In the end he will reshape your canines and will make it look a like lateral incisors. It depends on space availablity in your jaw. Dr M: The best option would be to consult an orthodontist. He will decide which option would be best in order to provide the most stable occlusal relationship as well as the most aesthetic outcome."

Dr M: Sinus perforation or an oral antral sinus is usually accompanied with symptoms, such as a constant wheezing sound, or fluid coming out of your nose when drinking. If some of these symptoms are not present, then most likely there is no sinus perforation, and you just have to give the area some time to heal.\nAlso note that a sinus opening is a common risk associated with the removal of  any maxillary teeth, whose roots are close or in the maxillary sinus."

I am told that the upper tooth will have to have an epinephrine shot because upper teeth can't be extracted without epinephrine. I wanted to ask on here if that is true? Has anyone had upper extractions without epinephrine? Dr M: You can definitely extract a top tooth without epinephrine as well. I do it on a regular basis. The LA without epinephrine does not always last as long, because it lacks the vasoconstriction effects of the epinephrine, but it still numbs the tooth. There are certain patients with specific medical conditions, where we only use LA without epinephrine for top and bottom teeth. \nI see no reason why it can't be done without epinephrine MattKW: Sure, can do it without epi. Only downsides are: less effective, less working time, smaller maximum dose allowed (if doing mulitple extractions), and more likely to bleed. All of this is manageable.\nWhy aren't you able to have epi? dental_care: It's not universally true that you need epi for upper tooth extraction. Epinephrine is often added to local anesthetics to constrict blood vessels in that area. This can help reduce bleeding, increase the effectiveness of the anesthetic, and prolong its duration. The decision to use a local anesthetic with or without epinephrine depends on various factors, including the complexity of the extraction, the patient's medical history, and the dentist's preference."

My current dentist removed the molars and gave me implants. Getting rid of the infection and building my jaw bone back up was a lengthy process. Last few days: I just got my new teeth. My dentist filed them down until I was comfortable biting down and everything was great when I left the office.Now: I have a sore on one side of my tongue from rubbing against one of my implants.Question: Is this normal because my tongue got used to not having the molars in my mouth? Both teeth feel sharp, but only one side of my tongue is affected. I've already contacted my dentist but what I don't want to happen is they file down my tooth and I'm uncomfortable with the way my tongue sits later on or I wear down that side of my mouth because my tongue is used to sitting that way.If I'm being stupid, please say so. No judgement from me.Thank you MattKW: Did you feel the sharpness when the crowns were fitted, or were you numb at the time?\nDo you have photos or Xrays to show us?\nWhatever, it shouldn't feel sharp. Implant crowns should need negligible adjustments at the fitting appointment.\nSee your dentist. dental_care: Your tongue and oral tissues have likely adapted to the space and shape of your mouth without the molars for some time. When you introduce new dental implants, your tongue may need some time to reposition itself and adapt to the new structure. This could cause initial friction and irritation.About the sharpness, it is not supposed to happen. Talk to your dentist."

    "dialogue": "AcaFim: Hi,I thought I might post on a dental forum to see if anyone, particularly dentists, could offer me some practical advice/and or solutions on how I can get the time it takes to brush my teeth down. What I am looking for is advice on how to think more logically about what it means to brush teeth (e.g. why we do it and what is needed). I think if I can think more logically about it, then I can get the time down back to normal. I understand already that plaque is a very soft substance and is easily removed through gentle brushing. I remind myself of this everytime I brush, but it doesn't seem to be enough. So yes, any information like this, or any advice on tangible solutions to get the time down would be appreciated.So, the current issue is that, due to OCD, it is taking me a very long time to brush my teeth (between 1 to 1.5 hours). I understand the potential consequences of brushing for this long and that is why I am very careful/gentle and only use a extremely soft bristled brush made by a periodontist. There is NO aggressive brushing at all. In fact, prior to this specific OCD developing, my old brushing method (which was around 3 minutes) was so bad that it caused receding gums. The irony is that this new routine is so gentle but it's taking a very long time due to OCD/fatigue. Over time a routine/order has developed that is specific and takes so long. The thing with brushing teeth is that you need some sort of method (routine) in order to brush thoroughly and this is where I think I am getting stuck. Although 1.5 hours sounds like a long time, I want to make it clear that I am not brushing one area for countless minutes; it's just that the WHOLE routine takes this long. There is various steps from start to finish to cover all my teeth if that makes sense. Again, I am fully aware of the consequences of excessive brushing. Despite the OCD, I am generally not running into any issues apart from some mild sensitivity on the teeth surface and gums. Everything seems ok.Things I am trying to do are:watching YouTube videos of dental hygienists brushing their teeth and trying to copy them\nletting go of being perfect and accepting that I may have missed a spot\ngetting ok with distractions while brushing\nI'm also working with a mental health professional, but so far nothing seems to be reducing the time. This is why I started to think outside the box and thought it might be a good idea to ask for some advice on a dental forum.I've read on reddit that some people have used a timer. However, I haven't used a timer yet as I feel that might stress me out.I want this activity to become unconscious again. I used to not think about brushing my teeth and had no dental issues. Now when I brush my teeth I can't be distracted by anything otherwise I get doubts about if I have brushed a spot or not.Thanks"

    "title": "Front Flipper Question",
    "dialogue": "Hey Man: Greetings,I had to get a front flipper a while back due to knocking out a portion of the tooth when I was kid and decades later the tooth just started to deteriorate and become loose - so it had to be removed. Now since I work from home, I admittedly did not wear it often and I think some of front teeth have shifted a bit. The flipper still fits, but there are slight gaps with the surrounding teeth. My dentist said that if I wear the flipper consistently, it should push the teeth back. My question is: is this accurate or is my dentist humoring me more or less to get me to wear the flipper which I know I should be doing anyway?Thank you very much. HM MattKW: So it sounds like your teeth are moving apart. Wearing the flipper won't stop that because it rests on the inside of your teeth, and has no way of pulling your teeth inwards, viz., not wearing it makes no difference in this sense. Hey Man: MattKW said:\t\t\tSo it sounds like your teeth are moving apart. Wearing the flipper won't stop that because it rests on the inside of your teeth, and has no way of pulling your teeth inwards, viz., not wearing it makes no difference in this sense.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nThanks for getting back to me. I guess my dentist was suggesting that the tooth portion of the flipper would push back the tooth next to it over time especially if the tooth has nowhere to go now with the fake tooth in it's way like if the real tooth was still there. I was told initially that teeth can potentially shift over if there is a huge gap there now from a missing tooth and as I said - I wasn't wearing it, so that is certainly my fault. This wasn't a problem otherwise. If the flipper won't do anything - what does modern dentistry offer to just fix slight gaps. A retainer of sorts for like two or three teeth? I am assuming if someone wanted to fix a front top teeth middle gap, you don't need the works just for that - both cost wise and whatever device you need to wear.   Appreciate your feedback.Thank you,HM MattKW: 1-3 teeth could be a simple acrylic denture as the cheapest option. Hey Man: MattKW said:\t\t\t1-3 teeth could be a simple acrylic denture as the cheapest option.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nDo you mean to straighten the teeth - can you show me a photo of what this looks like? I certainly don't want to pull the teeth. Just the cheapest straightening options for one to two teeth. I assumed some kind of retainer that would only be a few hundred dollars.Thank you. MattKW: How about you give us a few photos of your teeth? From front and underneath. Hey Man: MattKW said:\t\t\tHow about you give us a few photos of your teeth? From front and underneath.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nI will post photos, but I am kind of shocked that pulling the teeth was the conclusion here, when the issue is straitening ala a retainer, invisalign, etc. and the teeth are fine more or less otherwise outside of my gum issues I told you about before.Pulling teeth is typically the absolute final move you make after you have tried 10 other things first to save the tooth and I am not there yet. I just wanted to see what you would recommend. I live in Canada and so my dentist may not utilize some options that your practice does and that I could ask them about."

    "title": "Vertical root fracture symptoms after 4 months",
    "dialogue": "iartemch: Hello, I’ve had pain and pressure in the gum and in my #9 tooth with root canal for the last 4 months. The tooth is covered by a veneer. The root canal was done because of pain after veneer replacement -  It was done 6 months before  my current symptoms began.\nNothing showed up on the X-ray taken 3.5 months ago. 2 dentists and 1 endodontist say root canal looks good. I have had 4 bite adjustments with some relief after that. The dentist who replaced my veneers and did crown lengthening said I needed to come for another adjustment. She also suggested it might be vertical root fracture. Another dentist suggested to see ENT since my sinus infection might be causing it ( I also developed pain and pressure in gums in teeth #10, 11 and even 12). \nI have no pain in tooth #9 when biting. In fact, pain and pressure disappear when I bite while eating. Also, no pain or pressure while wearing a night guard. Given the fact that it has been 4 months since my symptoms started, shouldn’t I have developed a periodontal pocket or bone loss visible on the X-ray ? Since my veneer felt weird from the beginning (no problems with temporaries), is it possible that it did not fit right to the tooth under it? Can my sinus infection mess up my tooth since I am congested and feel pressure and pain in maxillary sinus mostly on that side?Please, any advice is greatly appreciated. I don’t want to extract my upper front tooth if there is no need for it. Thank you! MattKW: 1. I would've expected a periodontal swelling to have developed as you say. Bone loss may not be visible on a standard dental Xray. You might see a fracture on a CBCT, but I would've expected the perio to be the first sign. Also, there should be pain on biting with a fracture.\n2, Can't see why a veneer would've caused much change in your bite unless there was significant incisal adjustment. Normally you still have to keep the length of a single veneer within the movement envelope consistent with adjacent teeth, unless you do a lot at the same time.\n3. Nothing to do with sinus issues. Maxillary sinus issues only affect back teeth, say 2nd premolar and backwards and would manifest as a dull ache, exacerbated when chewing, and not easily located to a single tooth.Yeah, can't say for sure. A crack seems the most likely out a poor choice of possibilities. Maybe consider a simple ortho retainer for a few months rather than risk something more aggressive. Pls write back here when you find a diagnosis and effective solution. iartemch: Thank you for your reply. I am planning to get CBCT to see what goes on with the tooth and the bone.\nI will write if/when I get a diagnosis. iartemch: Hi.\nThis is an update to my post regarding pressure and pain in gum after a new veneer was bonded. After several consultations, I was finally diagnosed with biological width violation. According to the dentist who removed the veneer, the veneer was sitting way too close to the bone pressing on it and causing chronic inflammation and irritation. In addition to that, there was an access cement under the gum that was not cleaned after the bonding. It is worth mentioning, that while I was waiting for this appointment, my gum became very sensitive and bled when probed. \nI spent a lot of money on my 2 veneers and now I have to redo the veneer that was not done properly. It irritated the nerv in my tooth and I had to have a root canal that did not fix the problem. I went to the dentist who did the veneers 3 times and every time she suggested that I clenched my teeth and kept adjusting my bite while in fact she had placed the veneer too high and did not clean the cement properly after bonding. Should I contact her office and ask for my money back? I am really upset. MattKW: Sad to hear. Would've thought BWV would've been picked up earlier. \nIf your symptoms have indeed been resolved, then you may have reason to ask for compensation. I'd suggest you gather any evidence you can, then start initial contact to the dentist - before and after photos would be useful. Do it in writing and be polite; expect only that you may get the cost of any remedial re-treatment (don't try for \"pain and suffering\" - this wasn't life or death issue). If that fails, seek advice from any local consumer assistance office."

I had a patient in today for an extraction and immediate addition to a CoCr, so i'll get 3 UDAs (at £11 per UDA) but it's costing me £75 in lab fees so I've paid for the pleasure of treating this patient.

Yours looks way too thick for comfort and functionality - more likely to cause a problem than to fix it.\nThe thickness at the front is a result of how THIN it can be made at the back. Quite often the thickness over the 1st molars might be ~1mm (usually no point covering 2nd molars) which in turn would lead to ~3mm opening at front. Go back and see if that can be thinned down. If you were my patient, I wouldn't attempt it chairside because of that degree of thickness - it would be better done on an articulator in a lab."

    "title": "Concern About Chlorhexidine Mouthwash",
    "dialogue": "Hey Man: Greetings,I was recently prescribed a Chlorhexidine mouthwash to use for two weeks to help with my gingivitis and in particular heal what I was told was an inflamed gum issue which has caused what looks like a sort of skin tag/canker on the gum portion of the inside of my teeth.  However being the paranoid person that I am with medications and side effects, I read about how it can cause stains and even further tarter issues - which is already a problem for me because I produce a lot of plaque/tarter because I have an extreme dry mouth problem and so saliva isn't being produced properly. In addition to other side effects like taste changes, etc. I just wanted to get a second or even third opinion on Chlorhexidine - would this really be the only way to deal with the inflamed gum skin tag/canker vs say Colgate's Peroxyl or some other mouth wash/treatment with less side effects? Just looking at some Google searches - I have seen some dentists say they don't use it, but they really didn't go into detail why outside of acknowledging the side effects. Perhaps the risks don't outweigh the benefits in their view. I just was hoping to be able to actually talk to a dentist here about it. Is the risk of staining very low if you don't exceed the two weeks and can it be removed if there is indeed staining?I would greatly appreciate any feedback on the above and whatever stance any dentists here have about the Chlorhexidine mouth wash. Recommending or otherwise. Thank you.HS MattKW: It doesn't sound like a canker ulcer (apthous ulcer) and chlorhex mothwash (CHX) doesn't help that anyway. CHX is excellent for helping to improve gum health, but works only if you are practsising good oral hygiene , i.e. brsuhing, flossing. It is not a miracle cure by itself. As for staining, a 0.12% solution or 50:50 0.2%:water mix doesn't lead to staining. I use the 0.2% solution last thing at night for last 15 years and have had no noticeable side-effects like staining, taste disturbance, dryness (no alcohol in it).

I asked my dentist that I recently noticed a raised skin bump that my tongue went over - she looked at it and mentioned it was due to the inflammation per my gum issues in general. This would not have been prescribed otherwise. Just to try to get rid of the bump/inflammation - whatever it is.As I mentioned, I have extreme dry mouth problems due to a deviated septum - so I am often breathing through my mouth. In addition, I take Tegretol for epilepsy, so that further contributes negatively to gum issues. It is always going to be a problem no matter how good the oral hygiene is, which is why I go in for 3 month cleanings instead of 6 months.I can take a photo of it if you wanted to see unless you already have an idea what it is, but if CHX doesn't help in this regard to heal the skin bump - what would? Does Colgate Peroxyl help with such things?If the staining is not really an issue at this solution level for two weeks - why are there endless warnings over CHX and some dentists that definitively are against using it? I get with any drug - you need to list possible side effects, but it seems this goes beyond that and there is almost fear mongering going on with CHX, which quite frankly inspired my post here.   Thank you very much for your time.HM MattKW: Sure, put up a photo.\nAs for the potential for staining, I have personally found it over-rated. Yes, I've had a few patients start to develop a stain, but it is easily polished off by a dentist. I attach an article with some sentences highlighted.

If both do cause staining - can that be polished away as well?My wife came home with this new Colgate toothpaste in Canada with stannous flouride as the active ingredient per the photo below as she thought it might be helpful per the issues I have mentioned to you. Just wanted to get your thoughts. Thank you very much.HM MarkBrown32: Have you tried bluem? Great for treating inflamed gums. John Morgens: I understand your concerns about using Chlorhexidine mouthwash and the potential side effects. It's always important to weigh the benefits and risks of any treatment. I'm not a dentist, but I can offer some general insights that might help you make an informed decision.Chlorhexidine is an antiseptic mouthwash that is commonly prescribed to help manage gum inflammation, gingivitis, and other oral infections. While it can be effective in reducing harmful bacteria and promoting gum health, it's true that there are potential side effects to consider:1. Staining: Chlorhexidine can cause staining of teeth, dental restorations, and even the tongue. This staining is more likely if the mouthwash is used for an extended period or in higher concentrations.2. Taste Changes:  Some people may experience a temporary alteration in taste perception when using Chlorhexidine.3. Dry Mouth:  Given your existing dry mouth issue, it's important to note that Chlorhexidine might exacerbate this symptom for some individuals.It's worth discussing your concerns with your dentist or healthcare provider. They can provide guidance on whether the potential benefits of using Chlorhexidine outweigh the risks in your specific situation. They might also explore alternative treatment options based on your individual needs and health profile. Colgate's Peroxyl is a milder oral rinse that's used for soothing oral irritations, but it may not provide the same level of antibacterial action as Chlorhexidine.Regarding the staining risk, using Chlorhexidine for the prescribed two weeks under professional guidance should have a lower likelihood of causing significant staining. Regular dental hygiene practices and professional cleanings can help manage any staining that might occur.Ultimately, the decision on whether to use Chlorhexidine or explore alternative options should be made in consultation with your dentist. They can provide personalized advice based on your oral health condition, medical history, and treatment goals.You can get more information from dentist professionals by visting Mylifesmiles.

If you are struggling to get gums under control, the purported side-effects are not very common, nor are they serious. If you start getting side-effects of staining or taste disturbance, just stop using it."

Dr M: Could be an enlarged fordyce granule, or even a part of the canine prominence ( bony protuberance) . To rule out any draining sinus from a possible abscess, more clinical information and an x-ray is needed. John Morgens: A white bump near the upper canine tooth that persists for a week could be due to several possibilities:\nCanker Sore: Canker sores are small, painful white or gray sores that can develop inside the mouth. They often heal on their own within a week or two.\nMucocele: A mucocele is a harmless cyst that forms when a salivary gland duct becomes blocked. It appears as a fluid-filled bump and might resolve on its own or require medical attention.\nCandidiasis (Oral Thrush): A fungal infection called candidiasis can cause white patches or bumps in the mouth. It's more common in individuals with weakened immune systems.\nTrauma or Irritation: Accidental biting, friction from dental appliances, or other forms of irritation can lead to the formation of small white bumps that usually heal as the source of irritation is removed.\nHPV Lesion: In some cases, a white bump could be a manifestation of an oral HPV lesion, although this is less common.\nDental Abscess: A dental abscess, which is a localized infection, can sometimes present as a white bump. It's usually accompanied by pain, swelling, and other symptoms.\nLeukoplakia: Leukoplakia is a condition that causes white patches or bumps on the inner cheeks, gums, or tongue. It might be associated with tobacco use or irritation.\nGiven the variety of potential causes, it's important to have the bump examined by a dentist or medical professional for an accurate diagnosis. They can provide appropriate treatment recommendations based on the underlying cause and your specific situation.

    "dialogue": "Najen: Hello! A dentist spotted resorption on my routine dental X-ray and referred me to an endo, who said I have external resorption, rather than internal, and nothing further can be done, from his perspective.  I have no symptoms, but the endo said the tooth could fail at any time, months or years.  Would extraction (and subsequent implant) now be the best course of action?  See my X-rays attached.  Any idea about what stage on the Heithersay scale my case would be?  Also, what is the predominant theory on what causes resorption?  I have had no trauma to the tooth but did have braces as a teen.  Thank you! John Morgens: I'm sorry to hear about your dental situation. While I can provide general information, it's essential to consult your dentist and endodontist for personalized advice. Based on the information you've provided:\nTreatment Approach: External resorption, if detected early and not causing symptoms, might not require immediate treatment. However, the tooth's prognosis can be uncertain. Consulting with an experienced dentist or oral surgeon for a second opinion is advisable to determine the best course of action based on your specific case.\nExtraction and Implant: Extraction followed by dental implant placement could indeed be a consideration, especially if the tooth's stability becomes compromised. Dental implants are a common solution for replacing extracted teeth, offering stability and a natural appearance.\nHeithersay Scale: External resorption can progress at different rates. The Heithersay scale categorizes external resorption into five stages, with Stage 1 being the least severe and Stage 5 being the most severe. It's important for a dental professional to assess your case and determine its stage accurately.\nCauses of Resorption: The exact cause of external resorption isn't always clear, but there are several potential factors. It can sometimes be a response to inflammation, pressure, or trauma. In your case, a previous history of braces could potentially contribute to the development of resorption, although each case is unique.\nRemember, your dentist and endodontist are the best sources of information regarding your specific situation. If you have concerns or questions, don't hesitate to seek a second opinion from another dental professional. They can provide insights into your options, potential risks, and the best way to manage your dental health moving forward."

Sometimes I will get another circle or more appear near it.

Thank you! John Morgens: It's normal for the backside of your gums to have a slightly different appearance than the front or visible parts. The gums in the back of your mouth, especially around your molars, tend to have more irregularities, including natural folds and indentations. These variations are usually harmless and can be influenced by factors such as genetics, tooth alignment, and overall oral health.\nHowever, if you notice any unusual changes on the backside of your gums, such as swelling, redness, pain, bleeding, persistent sores, or any growths, it's a good idea to have it checked by a dentist or oral health professional. While most variations are normal, any changes that cause discomfort or concern should be evaluated to ensure there are no underlying issues.\nRegular dental check-ups are important for maintaining good oral health and catching any potential problems early. If you have any specific concerns about the backside of your gums, it's best to consult a dental professional for a proper evaluation and personalized advice."

Dr M: You can consider getting antibiotics from your GP if their is active infection. koontz74: I have had a course of antibiotics from gp as initially thought it might be a sinus infection, I think the dentist has basically drilled to far and damaged the nerve, I really don't want to have the tooth extracted, but I can't live with this pain for another month. Dr M: You can ask the dentist to perform an emergency endo treatment in order to remove the nerve, and then save up to do the root canal procedure at another dentist, if they don't do root canal treatments themselves. The only other medication that might work, is anything anti-inflammatory, which you are already taking. John Morgens: It's important to consult with a dentist for personalized advice, especially if you're experiencing pain.\nOver-the-Counter Pain Relief: Continue taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen as directed on the label to help manage the pain and inflammation. Make sure to follow the recommended dosage and consult a healthcare professional if you have any concerns.Topical Analgesics: You can ask your pharmacist about topical oral analgesics or gels that are designed to provide temporary relief from oral pain. These might provide some localized relief.\nTemporary Filling Material: Some pharmacies offer temporary dental filling kits. These can be used to cover the exposed area of the tooth temporarily, providing a barrier against sensitivity and reducing pain. However, this is not a long-term solution, and you should still seek professional dental care.\nCold Compress: Applying a cold compress to the outside of your cheek where the painful tooth is located might help reduce inflammation and provide temporary relief.\nMaintain Oral Hygiene: Be sure to maintain good oral hygiene by gently brushing and flossing the area around the tooth. Keeping the area clean can help prevent further irritation.\nAvoid Trigger Foods and Drinks: Avoid extremely hot, cold, sweet, or acidic foods and drinks, as they might exacerbate the pain.\nElevate Your Head While Sleeping: Elevating your head slightly while sleeping might help reduce blood flow to the area, which could potentially alleviate some of the discomfort.\nConsult an Emergency Clinic: If the pain becomes unbearable or there are signs of infection (swelling, fever), you might consider visiting an emergency dental clinic. While they often focus on extractions, they might still be able to provide you with temporary relief or advice."

    "title": "Dead tooth?",
    "dialogue": "ToothTrouble10: Hi, \nMy upper right first molar is heavily filled (had to wait for treatment during lockdown so ended up being worse).  It has had periodic flare ups of mild pain since being placed 3 years ago. This has seemed to coincide with having a cold and some sinus pain. Pain started again about 3 weeks ago, again alongside symptoms of sinus inflammation. GP gave me penicillin, 5 day course, which finished a week ago.  It was also sensitive to hot and cold. I visited my dentist for a general check up prior to starting the antibiotics. He performed a cold test on the tooth which was normal. The pain is intermittent and some days barely there. The sensitivity has reduced. I am going on holiday in a week and panicked (very nervous patient), so booked a consult with an endodontist for an opinion. Tooth normal on x-ray, no pain on percussion.  He didn’t perform any thermal tests.  Said tooth would probably be ok, at least for a few weeks/months, but he could put antibiotics inside of it got worse before the holiday. He said it looked suitable for root canal treatment. Today I’ve had no pain. I’ve just used some ice on the tooth and felt nothing, so I’m guessing it’s dead. My question is, do I go to my own dentist and ask him to put antibiotics in or do I leave it alone and go on holiday?  Had a bad experience a few years ago with an emergency dentist who put medicine into a tooth and I was in agony the next day, ended up with an abscess. Many thanks if you’ve read this. Dr M: If the tooth became necrotic, there is a chance that it can stay like that for a short while. Bacterial accumulation will occur and gradually you will experience symptoms again, due to abscess formation.\nIf the endodontist advised that it should be fine to leave for a short while, then it should be okay.\nAlternatively you can have your dentist or endodontist, perform the initial emergency endo. ToothTrouble10: Thank you for responding.  Had an appointment yesterday with my regular dentist to plan some cosmetic work. He checked the tooth again. It did respond to cold but only a bit. He wasn’t concerned by this as the tooth is heavily filled. Is that something you’d expect to find?  Many Thanks . MattKW: ToothTrouble10 said:\t\t\tThank you for responding.

Many Thanks .\n\t\t\nClick to expand...If it responds to hot and cold in a similar manner to adjacent teeth, then it is not \"dead\", and does not need an RCT. From the info you supplied, I don't know why the endodontist wants to start an RCT. Antibiotics don't prevent a tooth from dying, nor do they cure it - they may only relieve pain for a short while in an emergency situation. Your info suggests possibly a leaking filling or a crack in the tooth. Attached is my toothache list I give to students. ToothTrouble10: Many thanks John Morgens: It sounds like you're experiencing a complex situation with your tooth, and it's important to consult with a dental professional for personalized guidance.\nFrom what you've described, it seems that there might be some uncertainty about the status of your tooth. While the endodontist mentioned that the tooth would probably be okay for a few weeks/months, it's always best to have a clear understanding of the situation before making any decisions.\nIf your tooth is indeed showing signs of infection or inflammation, your dentist might consider placing antibiotics within the tooth as a precautionary measure. However, since you've had a bad experience in the past with a similar approach, it's perfectly reasonable to be cautious.\nGiven that you're going on holiday in a week, it might be a good idea to consult with your own dentist again for a thorough evaluation. They can perform any necessary tests (like thermal tests) to assess the tooth's condition and give you specific advice based on your situation.\nIf the tooth is stable and not causing significant pain, it's possible that you could wait until after your holiday to take any further action. However, this decision should be made in consultation with your dentist, considering your dental history and the current state of the tooth."

Now, how strict do I actually need to be realistically? As online it’s saying white bread only and to cut crusts off etc all my with all the other do’s and dont’s and to me that just seems so extreme and I won’t lie I do love my food also I think that was more aimed at people who get the one time treatment done at the dentist. \nSo with my treatment how strict do I really need to be? My teeth are already whiter than average from last time and I’ll be putting it on every night for 7 days. Thanks \nAll advice appreciated MattKW: Avoid red wine and black coffee. \nThere's no need to put rice in your retainer to make space for the gel - a disproven idea.\nThe gel loses most effectiveness after 1.5 hours, so wearing overnight is OK but for faster result wear it during daytime and change every 1.5 hrs. \nThere is a limit beyond which your teeth will not get whiter. \nAny subsequent course will have a quicker result than the initial course."

You need to treat the cause of the periodontitis.\nI would not place implants in a patient with active periodontal disease Umitbat: He is a periodontist. \nHe will also do a treatment to cure gum disease.

That's a question mark for me too. Umitbat: How can i decide to try grafting or not? Dr M: If he is indeed a periodontist, I assume that he feels the periodontitis is stable. That is why he wants to go ahead with the implant placement. To decide on the grafting options, you will have to see how much bone is left as well as attached gum tissue, before placing the implants. Unfortunately I cannot comment on that since I don't have any clinical information regarding your case. The specialist will most likely decide if it is indeed required, but you can ask him about it Umitbat: Thanks for valuable information MattKW: That doesn't look like controlled periodontitis to me.

Dr M: Modern digital x-rays contain a lot less harmful radiation than their historic predecessors. I would not be too worried about the radiation. All medical professionals always try to go by the ALARA principle, which is \" as low as reasonably acceptable\" , in terms of radiation exposure and will only request x-rays or scans if it is really indicated. MattKW: Here's a graphic and an article which might allay your fears. We are constantly exposed to background radiation, and we take risks in many other ways that can be harmful. Canary: I often wondered this every time a Dental Technician put a lead vest on me for X-Ray!

    "dialogue": "Electric Boobs: I don't drink coffee but if I did I would have assumed that if I'd brushed my teeth immediately afterwards that the amount of time that any decay could occur would be restricted to the amount of time between when I started drinking, and brushed my teeth... thus stopping any damage occurring during the hours afterwards where trace amounts of the coffee may remain in my mouth. That assumption didn't seem too good to be true because, after all, the price is the inconvenience of having to brush. But I've heard I'm wrong here. Apparently it's best to wait for something like 20 minutes to allow your saliva to neutalise the acid or something, and that only then would you brush.I recently heard that teeth have pores and that if you brush your teeth immediately after consuming sugary food or tea/coffee that you're forcing the acid/sugar into the teeth in a way that causes more damage than otherwise would happen. In other words there's no way of escaping the damage. Or is there? I'd also like to know which more acidic, tea or coffee? because I've read both. It's tea that I drink!Thanks Dentist in Harare: It is recommended to wait at least 30 minutes after consuming coffee before brushing your teeth. This is because coffee, along with other acidic beverages, can temporarily soften the enamel on your teeth. Brushing immediately after consuming coffee can potentially damage the softened enamel.

In the meantime, you can rinse your mouth with water or chew sugar-free gum to help remove some of the coffee residue and freshen your breath. Remember to maintain a regular oral hygiene routine, including brushing twice a day and flossing daily, to keep your teeth and gums healthy. Electric Boobs: Dentist in Harare said:\t\t\tIt is recommended to wait at least 30 minutes after consuming coffee before brushing your teeth. This is because coffee, along with other acidic beverages, can temporarily soften the enamel on your teeth. Brushing immediately after consuming coffee can potentially damage the softened enamel.

MattKW: Toothy enamel starts dissolving at pH of 5.5\nCoffee has acidity of about 5. Not too bad.\nPlain soda water has acidity of about 5. Also not too bad.\nMost soft drinks (Coca Cola, Sprite, sports drinks, etc) have pH of about 2.5 due to added acid for tartness.\nEach pH point is 10x more acidic. \nSee attached."

    "dialogue": "SCmama: My son, 15 months old, had his first dentist exam today and the dentist took about 5 minutes to examine my sons teeth and determined that he had a crossbite and stated that if his bottom lateral incisors hadn’t come in yet that they were probably missing and we would have to correct later down the road (around age 13). Is this uncommon for those teeth not to have come in yet at 15 months old? Should I get a second opinion or should we just wait it out to see? I’m not sure if it’s necessary to note but he currently has his top and bottom central incisors, his top lateral incisors, and all 4 of his first molars popped through this past month. The dentist did not do X-rays because of his age to confirm any missing adult teeth, is this common practice? What questions should I be asking his dentist? Dr M: Although taking an x-ray on a young child is usually not done, if there is a specific reason to warrant the x-ray, a peri-apical x-ray can be taken.\nI would not agree with this initial consult. A lot can and will still change during your child's development. The bottom lateral incisors usually come out at around 10-16 months ( see attached photo ) and even then it can sometimes be a little delayed with a month or 3. Some children just develop a little slower. It is not to say there will be a massive issue. I would not worry in your case.\nI would suggest seeing a different dentist for another opinion, and maybe take a small peri-apical x-ray of the lower incisor area,just to make sure that all teeth are present. MattKW: Yep, go to another dentist for 2nd opinion."

    "dialogue": "MissH: I am 34 years old. Two years ago I had my bottom right wisdom tooth extracted following several episodes of pericoronitis. There have been no issues on that side since. However, on several occasions this year I have experienced pericoronitis in all of my 3 remaining wisdom teeth. My dentist says they have all grown out fully so there is no reason to extract them. I also brush and floss very carefully around the wisdom teeth, and even use a water flosser after every single meal. Yet still I have recurrent episodes of pericoronitis where the gum swells, is painful and bleeds. I often experience this on one upper wisdom tooth first, and shortly after the other upper wisdom tooth is affected too. I don’t understand why this has suddenly started happening this year despite good hygiene. I thought there might be a connection between my sinuses/ lymphatic drainage and this problem, as the glands on the roof of my mouth at the back often feel sore (even when I have no pericoronitis) and I do often experience sinus issues at the same time, however my dentist doesn’t believe there is any connection. Grateful for some guidance please as I am not sure what to do. MattKW: Would like to see an OPG (full mouth xray). Generally, most people don't fit their wisdoms in their moths well enough to maintain them, so recurrent pericoronitis or decay is likely."

    "dialogue": "Robert987: Hi,Around 20 years ago, I broke my front tooth and had a root canal treatment followed by capping. However, for the past year, I've been experiencing a persistent, dull pulsing pain inside the tooth.After visiting the dentist, an X-ray revealed a patch above the previous root canal treatment, but I can't recall the exact shade. A week later, the root canal specialist informed me that it might be a cyst. They suggested a re-root canal treatment (re-RCT) with a 60-70% chance of success. The plan is to assess the situation after two weeks to determine if the cyst has resolved, and if so, proceed with capping the tooth.I'm curious if there are alternative methods to remove the cyst, like surgical removal, drainage, or antibiotics. Another option I'm considering is leaving it as is, since the pain is bearable, but I'm worried it may worsen over time. The specialist mentioned that if the re-RCT doesn't work, they'll refer me to another specialist for a necessary surgical procedure, although I don't recall the specific name.I'm feeling quite confused about how to proceed, and I would greatly appreciate any guidance or help you can provide.Thanks in advance for your support.Best regards,\nRob Dr M: Good dayIt sounds like the surgical procedure they were referring to, was an apicectomy. Although a re-treatment might be indicated to try and reduce the cyst size, it won't clear it up completely. The granulation tissue at the root apex should be removed or curetted as well. This is most likely the surgical procedure that will come next in my opinion. So in full, a re-treatment and an apicectomy is needed. Robert987: Hi, thanks for your helpful advice, it’s really reassuring  and I can’t thank you enough,would you be able to advise on the uk cost of the apicectomy or is it included in the £600 re rct cost, the rct specialist I saw said he would refer me to another specialist for the surgery as he can’t do it, Kind regards Dr M: I am not too familiar with the fee structure in the UK. The only specialist that might be able to do both procedures is an endodontist or a general dentist with a special interest in oral surgery. Alternatively you are most likely looking at 2 different procedures that you will have to pay for separately. Robert987: Ok thankyou so much, I’ve searched for a endodontist instead my current dentist, I’ll go ahead with the endodontist as they do both procedures just incase the cyst remains, once again thanks for clearing this up for me, kind regards, Rob"

Or are all implants basically the same? I have even come across a Groupon for dental implants from a dentist. Dr M: Firstly, not all implants are the same. There are a lot of different types, which are made of different materials as well. The costs differ based on which company or brand is used, what type of implant is needed for your specific scenario, any additional procedures such as bone grafting, dentist vs specialist costs etc. Make sure that you see a reputable dentist or dental specialist with experience in placing implants.

Fillings in nearly every tooth, 3 root canals, 5 crowns and an apicoectomy, but this issue is a new one. While I could catch you up on the WHY, I’ll save it for therapy. Received an apicoectomy early may. Afterwards I was so horrified (and broke- no insurance) I had the endodontist check my other teeth. Sure enough, the molar behind it (farthest back, top left) that id been suspecting for a while was bothering me, had a small crack due to the enormous metal filling. Went to a new-to-me dentist and received crown prep and temporary. No issues. Then went back for the permanent and my tooth has been uber sensitive to cold and hot ever since, and it’s been 3 weeks. No signs of improvement. The thing is, I have a unique sinus situation that basically my sinuses sit on top of these two teeth and I can’t go through another root canal failure and apico, so if this tooth needs anything further, I’ll be getting it pulled. But the thought of the whole shebang makes me ill, considering I’m 5k into my teeth this year, and the little fact that the crown below it is also failing.

MattKW: A fracture above the gumline might be able to be fixed, like denting a panel in your car.\nWith a 1st premolar fracture, it's like shearing your car in two down the middle. Maxillary 1st premolars can do this because:They are 2-rooted, which makes them more likelt to split between roots rather than a single rooted tooth;\nThere is a groove on the mesial root surface that leads into the area between the roots.\nSometimes people have PM1s with very prominent cusps, adding to the splitting force when chewing.\nI had a patient who had a spontaneous fracture in a perfectly good 1st PM due to these fractures.

What if that septic fluid and blood are part of the body's mechanism of natural remineralization ( even though that sounds very unlikely that they would coincidentally also help with natural remineralization ) .\nI just cannot find any webpages of people (  DIY  ) tying a string around their broken Maxillary-first-premolar, hopefully fitting the fracture together properly, so that natural remineralization will may occur, obviously I would not be the first to think of this. MattKW: Teeth do not reform like a bone fracture; there are no living bone cells within the enamel or dentine that would allow this.

Get it extracted ASAP. 09080980980990898: Other types of tooth fractures can and do actually heal, via natural remineralization, some toothpastes are designed to help do that.I have observed that keeping the broken cusp in it's proper position, in other words never moving it, seems to stop infection and bleeding ( as I described in a reply above ).So there is a chance that the string ( or something ) idea I typed above could have some sort of percentage chance of being successful.I think that probably the reason dentists insist on extracting it is to not run any risk at all of patients health being affected by infection, regardless of it being an idea that could have some sort of percentage chance of being successful.Since I can find nothing on the internet of people doing this string ( or something ) idea DIY, I will have to have it extracted.

    "title": "Numbness in Left side Lips, Chin, Cheek, Gum and Teeth after RCT.",
    "dialogue": "seetwo: Hi all,This procedure happened in Australia since I'm not sure if they use different anaesthetics and or methods so I would like to make mention of this now.I had my first RCT on November 22nd 2022, this was to clean most of the nerves as I was getting very bad tooth aches from #18. I had no issues with numbness after this appointment.I had my 2nd RCT on Tuesday 13th December 2022.I was administered local anaesthesic in my lower left jaw close to #17 as the tooth being worked on was #18, but as I wasn't feeling too numb from it, my GD injected the anaesthetic behind the gums of #20-#19 and infront of the gums of #20-#19 (Roughly), they all stung when injected, I was injected a total of 3 times in 3 different locations.The treatment was going as planned until the very end, where my GD said that the very last Endo File tip broke inside my Root Canal.I was told that since it was the last file they were using, and the inside of the roots are clean and disinfected. There was no issues with the endo file tip inside. He filled the tooth up with filling and the procedure was done.I was not prescribed antibiotics for the 2nd RCT.For time reference, the 2nd RCT started at 9:50 AM and finished around 11:23 AM. The local anaesthetic wore off around 12:40 PM and I was no longer numb and my tooth started aching badly. I was taking Neurofen and Panadol but they were not helping with the pain. I was also getting migraines and jaw pain on the left side of my face/head.Please note that during all this time, I was no longer numbed from the Anaesthesia since it wore off until below this paragraph.[IMPORTANT]I took a nap at around 7:30 PM and woke up at roughly 7:40 PM from my tooth ache and migraine, i also noticed that my lips, chin, and cheeks were tingling like they were becoming numb...I took another nap at roughly 8:00 PM and woke up at 8:15 PM again from the tooth ache and migraine. This time I noticed my lips, chin, cheeks were completely numb. By this point I am freaked out.[IMPORTANT]The night goes on with me frantically worrying and giving myself panick attacks. I feel asleep properly at around 3 AM, and woke up at 7 AM still with a numb face.Morning comes through on Wednesday 14th December 2022 and I call the dental clinic first things first that they opened. 9 AM on the dot, I got an appointment at 12:30 PM and I went there.My GD did some diagnostics like tapping #18 to see if there was pain, and pushing on my gums infront of #18 to see for pain. I responded with no pain for both tests.He then told me that he doesn't know the reason to why my left side lips, chin, cheeks were numb.He then felt my neck and said that it was swollen on the left side, which could be the reasoning to the numbness (I assume), that I am now stuck with. I was then prescribed antibiotics and dexamethasone after this appointment.The tooth ache has subsided by 90% with the antibiotics but the dexamethasone hasn't done anything with the swollen neck or numbness.On Thursday 15th December 2022, I noticed that my teeth and gums from #17 to #23 are numb as well, Friday 16th is still the same deal with no easing on the numbness.Please help, I'm having issues with eating food, I can't tell what is hot, what is cold and I keep spilling food because I can't tell where my spoon is, I'm accidentally biting my lips and cheeks and I can only tell that I've bit them when I'm tasting blood.\nWho should I see to get this numbness identified? Am I too late to get this issue fixed?Is this nerve damage?\nIs it permanent?Please, please help me. What can I do and who should I see! Thank you,\nSeeTwo seetwo: Hi, just wanted to give an update to my situation and kind of document this through, just in case someone else goes through this horrible experience in the later future.It's been a week since the numbness has occurred after my RCT, It hasn't felt like the numbness has lessened and the numbed locations remains the same.Sometimes the affected area bubbles and tingles for a few seconds and then stops, sometimes it has a weird stinging pain as well.I've gotten fairly used to eating foods with a numb face, but it has ruined my enjoyment of eating in general so I just pick bland mushy food to not disappointment myself any further. MattKW: Australia uses same anaesthetics as most developed countries, and your numbness won't be associated with that. Other possiblities are that the IAN was badly pranged during the injection - it happens rarely, and would normally pass within a couple of days. I'd be more concerned that perhaps the apices of your molar were close to the IAN, and that there has been over-irrigation (or maybe over-instrumentation?) during the prep with NaOCl. I would talk to your dentist and ask for a referral to an endodontist along with all the records (notes and X-rays). seetwo: Hi MattKW,\nThanks for replying.It's been just over 2 weeks and I'm still numb with the same feeling as I was when I wrote this thread. I can't tell if it's getting any better or any worse. I will note that the numb parts are starting to hurt from any kind of touch that isn't my own finger. If I was to describe how it feels, I guess kind of like a paper cut sting mixed with a painful bruise. My left side jaw is still sore from that procedure as well.MattKW said:\t\t\tI'd be more concerned that perhaps the apices of your molar were close to the IAN, and that there has been over-irrigation (or maybe over-instrumentation?) during the prep with NaOCl.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nI think the procedure took around 1 hour and 20 minutes, so I guess it could be over-instrumentation? My dentist also did break an endofile inside my root canal, the endofile tip is still inside my tooth.My problem is that the anesthetics wore off 2 hours after the appointment.\nI was eating McDonald's French fries which were soggy and some bits were hard, then I started going numb again few hours later and it has been numb ever since.\nWhich leads me to think I could have an overfilled tooth, because I did eat a little bit on the side of my RT.I haven't been able to speak with my Dentist since their clinic is closed until 2023, so I can't get any answers or any solutions, and trying to find information through google isn't very helpful and just creates more confusion and panic. All I'm getting from Google is TMJ, IAN, etc.My next appointment is next year Jan 4th.Thank you. seetwo: So... it's been 6 weeks and it's still numb, I'm not sure if it's lessened or if I'm getting used to it being numb.My dentist said he can't do anything about it but only watch what's happening and hope it doesn't turn out worse. toothman88: seetwo said:\t\t\tSo... it's been 6 weeks and it's still numb, I'm not sure if it's lessened or if I'm getting used to it being numb.My dentist said he can't do anything about it but only watch what's happening and hope it doesn't turn out worse.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Sorry to hear you went through this.

How are you doing now?\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nI feel like I have gotten much better around April 2023, it feels like majority of the numbness has gone away but there are some spots that are still very slightly numb. Touching my chin in some spots will send a tingling feeling towards my lip and under my chin closer towards the neck.I can't really describe it, but the best way is that it feels like \"numbed\" area is slightly heavier than the unaffected sided. Simply put it just doesn't feel the same and I can tell that something doesn't feel right. The left side is slightly less sensitive than my right side.\nHowever, I am pretty used to it and my teeth and gums aren't numb anymore so eating isn't really an issue anymore but there are some days where my chin just feels really weird.I hope it still has some more healing to go through so it doesn't feel so weird, but I would rather the feeling I am having now rather than being completely numb like I was just after the RCT."

I went to the dentist they took x-rays and said he doesn't see anything on the x-rays but it does look like there's a pocket and  little swollen and gave me antibiotics and the mouthwash and said it was an infection and told me to see a periodontist. He did something with the scale tool and it was a number seven he said food may have gotten in and infected it. The next day I was eating a hamburger and bit down and the pain shot from a 7 to a 10. That lasted for about a day and then I guess the antibiotics started to kick in and my pain was almost gone. I went to the periodontist a few days later  they told me the tooth is probably fractured which cannot be seen on the x-ray And I should have it extracted, they Determine this by tapping on my tooth and it did feel a tiny bit different than the others. No pain really just different but I did jump thinking it would feel like it did that day when it was her that's worst. I think I scared her lol\nAs of now a week later my pain is out about a one. \nMy dilemma is I am going away in 2 weeks on a cruise which will be eating good for 7 days  and I don't know what to do. Should I have the tooth pulled before I go away which would give me about a week and 3 days to heal. is 3 days enough time? Would I be able to eat normal? or should I leave it and get it taken care of when I come back and just bring some antibiotics with me in case it does get infected again? \nIs it possible The tooth is not fractured and just was infected due to the deep pocket? I really don't want to pull a good tooth if I don't need to since my insurance does not cover a replacement. It is the third tooth on the top left of my mouth in the back. So not the wisdom not the one next to it but the next one. \nJust also mentioning there is no dentist on a cruise ship and I cannot deal with that pain when I would be away if it does come back.

My dentist told me let there may be a chance for certain things if he pulls the tooth since it's a big tooth. As of right now like I said I am in no pain and I'm trying to chew on just one side of my mouth not to disturb it. I am going to leave it until I come back because I don't want complications from an open wound or chance of dry socket or stitches opening. I understand that may have the same complications with a fractured tooth breaking but looks like either way I'm screwed.

My dentist decided to put a full cuspal composite overlay, he said this will stop the tooth flexing. After this procedure I have been unable to bite anything hard on this tooth and my gums felt swollen, orginally starting from just the treated tooth and over weeks progressing along my lower jaw/gums right to the centre bottom teeth. Antibiotics seemed to have cleared up the swollen feeling in my gums temporarily, however it recurred.I went to my dentist and told him my tooth hurts when I bite anything hard. He said that the pain is because the filling is high, he said he will adjust the filling. He didn't tell me, but he filed down the top teeth above the filling. Now I have pain in my canines and other teeth. They feel like they are clashing together, chipping my teeth, causing the gums on my canines to recede and causing a lot of pain.I am not happy that the dentist filed my teeth without my permission or even telling me what he did. I have no idea how many teeth he touched but can see two teeth are significantly shorter than the same tooth on the opposite side. Also his dental nurse alerted me to him filing my top teeth when she told him \"What are you doing?!\" And he simply said \"I'm not doing any damage\". It looks like he wanted to make sure the top left couldn't touch the bottom left molar. However filing my good teeth for a bad tooth that had a \"crack like glass\" that may have gone right through is illogical to me. Now I have pain in the top teeth on the opposite side since the filing down, and my teeth on the opposite side seem to be banging together causing pain. The pain is keeping me awake. I'm scared it will do damage but I do not trust him anymore because he filed down teeth, which cannot be undone, without telling me and it seems to have created more problems for me. Please give me advice on how to proceed. Dr M: It sounds like you might also have a grinding issue. I would seek a second opinion in this case."

This made no sense to me to have a temporary filling that might fall out in 6 months.\nDue to me being hesitant in agreeing to the temporary work she agreed to metal but would now, all of a sudden only need 1-2 fillings.Being as I was left feeling I was going against her best advice & she appeared unhappy doing NHS metal fillings, saying it would involve removing more good tooth that goes against what they are trying to achieve, I was hoping to get other thoughts, it appears mad to me there is no NHS option she can recommend and only private work could fix my teeth?In the past from my previous practice, I was always told the mental ones are not nice looking but stronger and will last longer.I will also add, I always have a regular 6 monthly check-up and moved to this practice about 6 years ago as my last practice stopped doing a scale and polish and instead kept recommending private hygienist visits. My new practice, although not as pushy on chargeable work also wont do a scale and polish.I could be wrong but I just keep getting the feeling all the \"best advice\" I keep being given by dentists is more about steering me away from NHS and charge me private fees. I used to trust my dentists would always give me the best advice. MattKW: I would have to see Xrays to at least judge your degree of erosion. If you have xrays taken several years apart to show rate of wear, then this would be even better. Bitewings (perpendicular) xrays are best for this type of comparison. I attach 2 examples of a patient taken 3 years apart, and an info sheet about acidity:Pic taken 2007 when patient is 13yo. The green shows the thickness of good enamel on 2nd molar, the orange shows reduced enamel on 1st molar. \nPic taken in 2010. The enamel on 1st molar is now very fine as evidenced by red arrows.

MattKW: You can request access to copies of your records, including xrays, specialist reports, clinical notes.\nIt's not as simple as amalgam Vs composite:Amalgam: Like concrete, you need a fair amount of depth to make it work and this will necessitate drilling down and getting closer to the pulp (nerve) . Also, it does not adhere to the enamel of the tooth.\nComposite: Can sometimes do it thinner than amalgam with less drilling, and will adhere to enamel and dentine. More likely to fail than amalgam or give post-op sensitivity.\nIn the Xrays I showed you, I referred the teenager to a prosthodontic specialist; composite was preferred for the short term ( 5-10 yrs) with ceramic after that for the long term. Very expensive.\nThe appropriate treatment for you depends upon your age, the area of erosion (one tooth or many?), the depth of erosion, the closeness of your nerve to the tooth surface, and your ability to halt the erosive action (\"...drinking diet orangeade\").\nIf you can get the Xrays and tell me your age, then I can give better advice. There is rarely only ONE answer in dental care - there are options with varying degrees of success, risks, and costs. MattKW: Also have a look at this thread.

All the erosion is on the outer side of the teeth.I therefore need my right second incisor and first molar building-up on the outer edge.My erosion on my left is much more minimal but part of the inside edge of my second premolar broke off recently, this is the third build-up filling.Thanks again. MattKW: Erosion is always most evident on lower teeth because this is where the acidic drink will naturally go (gravity!). At 55yo, if you have minimal erosion AND can give up the acidic drinks, then you probably be OK."

Pushing on the gum line in that spot also hurts. No heat or cold sensitivity detected. When this happened previously my dentist said it was gum recession, did not find evidence of a cavity and prescribed a fluoride gel to apply for a week. Could it be that or is it something else?Latest OPG attached (for a different issue though), taken 4 May, 2023 (did not have this problem then). Dr M: Difficult to see anything on the x-ray. I think a clinical examination is necessary to rule out recession, traumatic occlusion or even crack formation. AW89: I went to the emergency clinic in my city, the doctor did a cold test which was fine, and found nothing out of ordinary on the x-ray - no infection, no swelling. She did note that the tooth felt a little loose but did not seem worried about it. No test for crack. The pain is now localised around one tooth at the gum line but there is no abnormal cold or heat sensitivity, only pressure. She put some gel on my gum and said if the pain persists, I should come back. Do you have any thoughts with this additional information?"

    "dialogue": "partialbracesqueen: I got braces as a teenager and basically my parents got divorced and fought over who was going to keep paying for them and no one ended up paying so I removed them myself with pliers. The only things I couldn't get off were the dental glue (bonding cement) used to attatch the brackets to my teeth and one of the molar bands (because it is stuck while the other molar bands & brackets were fairly easy to get off). I've avoided seeing a dentist due to embarrassment over this so I haven't even had my teeth cleaned in years. But I'm ready to move on from having this crap on my teeth. I called an orthodontist office and they said they won't work on another orthodontist's work even though it's just one band and some dental glue. I've been told most orthodontists won't do this. So I was thinking of calling some dentists in the morning but I was just wondering what are the chances of them agreeing to take this stuff off my teeth? Is it even worth trying or should I just try again to get the band/glue off myself?Please no rude/sarcastic or flippant comments. I know neglecting my dental hygiene is bad. Yes it was a mistake to let it get this far. I'm doing the best I can to fix it now and I don't need a lecture. Dr M: The band can be removed by a dentist with the appropriate instruments. Just explain the situation to them. The cement can also be cleaned off"

Hornnumb2: Here is a before. 53 MattKW: Thank you.\n2 articles are attached. Whilst in young people there can be significant over-eruption (\"dropping down\"), this lessens for older people. These are 2 (admittedly small) studies with ages 33-58yo and 25-69yo which conclude that there is clinically insignificant movement in adults. Although the absolute age of each person is not cross-referenced to the amount of overeruption, I think it could be safely assumed that the older the person, then the smaller and less significant the movement.\nIn other words, you probably don't need an implant. If your dentist suggests otherwise, then you have these articles that suggest otherwise, unless he can find other literature.

    "title": "Piece of tooth just came out",
    "dialogue": "bordor: Years back I had a dentist who essentially \"planed down\" the backs of my two front teeth. He said he was doing it as part of a bite adjustment, but it never made any sense to me because I have an overbite and my two front teeth do not make contact with any other teeth in my mouth. I noticed after this that those bottom parts of my teeth seemed fragile, almost transparent and another issue is that since he did that, it has always extremely uncomfortable for my tongue to make contact with the backs of my two front teeth - it feels kind of rough and sharp like sandpaper. I told the dentist about this at the time and he said he could polish it to make it smoother, but whatever he did not make it better but worse, so after that I didn't bring it up again, because I did not want to risk any more damage to my teeth. Fast forward to the present. I just felt something kind of jagged at the bottom my front tooth. I put my finger in to touch the jagged area and a chunk of the bottom middle section of the tooth simply came out!! leaving a gap in the middle of the tooth. This is the part of the tooth my previous dentist had \"planed down.\" I'm sure the tooth structure was weakened by what he did, but I never expected anything like this would happen. I'm hoping someone can give me some feedback on this. I'm traveling overseas right now and wondering what I should expect if I go see a dentist in the country where I am. What is normally done for something like this? Would this basically be a cosmetic procedure? Would a dentist simply be able to fill the area where there is now a gap in my front tooth or is it more complicated?Thanks for your feedback. Dr M: I think your case is a bit more complicated. I would definitely suggest a full consultation and bite analysis is necessary. Would need to rule out any possible malocclusions and need for orthodontic treatment. \nUnfortunately a lot more information is necessary to adequately comment on this case. MattKW: Quite often what patients think is a bit of a broken lower tooth is actually tartar fracturing off. Send us a photo."

Today morning I had the same flickering movement in the gums but only once and the pain started about 10 mins later. That pain radiated from that center point to other teeth. The pain is not in the teeth but on the upper part towards the gums. today I rinsed my mouth with salt water which calmed the pain down in 2-3 mins.What should I do about those movements in the gums? Is this something I should be worried about? Dr M: I think you should consider seeing your dentist for a consult and cleaning.

Dr M: Discolouration on a tooth can mean a lot of things, one of which is pulpal necrosis. Sometimes the nerve dies due to trauma a long time ago. \nDo you have x-rays that you could share? MattKW: Yeah, we really need that Xray; sometimes people \"see\" too much that doesn't really exist, or in your case may mistake the incisive foramen for an abscess.  Also, a pulp test with a cold spray or CO2 should have been performed - you don't mention that.\nIn the absence of pain or a gumboil, it could just be that the tooth has calcified from a blow some years ago.

The hygienist told me I had recession on my bottom front teeth and told me to come back every 6 months. However, the problem came back again 3 weeks later but instead of the pain being in my gums it was more in my teeth and jaw this time. I decided to get a general checkup at a private dentist and they did x-rays and checked my probe depths.

I’m worried if I don’t sort it now I could eventually have bone loss.I did have orthodontic treatment around 2 years ago, but the black triangles weren’t present after I had the braces removed, I’m wondering if this could be linked? Dr M: Definitely not necrotizing gingivitis. A simple google search can tell you this. Recession can be due to a lot of reasons, including one being the type of gingival biotype you are classified as. A thin biotype usually has black triangles forming due to the simplest of reasons, such as brushing too hard, since the amount of attached gingiva is not a lot. I would not be to worried if probing depths reveal no real attachment loss. You can stick to using a soft tooth brush only. If you want to treat this for aesthetic reasons, you can seek the opinion of a periodontist. They will confirm the presence or lack of any periodontal disease, and then can inform you about gingival grafts procedures to cover up these areas. MattKW: You certainly don't have Acute Necrotising Ulcerative Gingivitis (ANUG), Have only seen a few in my life and they are very distinctive, plus foul-smelling.\nAs for recession, it is quite minor, and could be partly due to the orthodontic treatment.

There was pain swallowing that went away in a week with salt gargles and antibiotics as I immediately had flu and a cough.2 oral surgeons and 3 dentists later, today after approx 1 and a half month. 3 days ago, I had tooth extractions. 2 wisdoms and 4 infected teeth that already had RCTs years ago.

They are not due to reflux. I've been looking at tongues for 40 years and you look normal.

I had 4 bite adjustments that help somewhat. But it has been 4 months and pain and pressure are still there. \n‘I saw 3 dentists, including an endodontist and they could not find anything. The dentist who did the veneer suggested vertical roof fracture that is not visible on the cbct. But I have absolutely no pain when biting, tapping and pressing on the tooth. In fact, the pain is gone when I am eating and biting.\nOnly the gum is sore but is neither inflamed  nor swollen. When I am wearing a night guard, there is no pressure or pain. As soon as I take it out, the pressure and pain are slowly coming back. My dentist says I am clenching my teeth, but I cannot possible clench them as soon as I take the night guard out. Additionally, my lip where the tooth is started to get num feeling that comes and goes . Recently, I started to feel pressure and pain in gum above teeth #10 and 11 and the teeth feel sore to the touch from time to time. The veneer on tooth #9 felt kind of weird from the beginning but two dentists said it seemed well done.Given it has been 4 months since my symptoms started, if it were a root fracture, shouldn’t it have gotten worse or more painful with some bone damage visible on the X-ray and gum detachment(periodontal pocket)? Is it possible the veneer does not fit properly to the tooth underneath it and causing all this pressure and pain in the gum?I don’t want to pull a good tooth, especially top front tooth,  but I cannot live in pain forever.

I consume massive amounts of protein powder everyday. based on my calculations my calcium intake exceeds 2-3 times RDA.\nhas anybody any info to deny or support my theory?\nthanks. MattKW: Your body tightly regulates calcium levels through PTH, osteoclastic activity (in the bones), and kidney excretion. If there is a problem maintaining this balance, e.g. a tumour in parathyroid gland, allowing for hypercalcaemia, you will become very ill. Has nothing to do with calculus formation.\nMost people find calculus control is easier when using an electric toothbrush to get behind the lower front teeth."

    "dialogue": "ConfusedPotentialPatient: I'm frustrated with what's going on with a tooth of mine and how complicated things seem to be.  I am in NY metro area, if that matters to the way dentists work vs. elsewhere.I had lower molar pain at same time as sinus congestion. sensitivity to cold, dull ache.\n1 Week later with sinuses clear but still have pain, went to general dentist (new guy taking over practice from someone retiring / I've been with for a few years (I am 60).\nHe xray tooth - roots are good he said.  Thought it was a bite issue and grinded down a high spot.\n1 week later, pain was increasing and to more things - anything not room temp, pressure from chewing.\nNot really responding / decreased from advil or motrin.\nWent back to dentist. He said I should / need to go to endontist.Endontist does 360 xray of tooth. Says root is dying. Sees some cracks in tooth, filling is intact.  Does the first part of root canal as part of assessing situation.Says he doesn't recommend a root canal / cap? because tooth is cracked - that will only get you 1 - 2 years max.  Better to pull it, implant and crown.He doesn't do any of that.  Gotta go to periodontist.it's been a week and no pain at all, so while I question doing the partial root canal to figure things out (and $700 cost), I guess it was needed to determine how to solve this long term?Perio looks and says he can pull tooth, wait for healing, put in implant, wait for healing, go to dentist for crown.My wife worked with this perio for similar work on her mouth.  She likes him.I am hesitant about the long process and feeling this is a good example of 'if you only have a hammer, everything is a nail'.Endo only does root canal?  He does the first part of it to do assessment.\nPerio pulls teeth so that's his solution?Tried to get appt with the older dentist I started with to discuss their involvement / his thoughts / etc.  They rattle off the month long process.  I push to set an appointment consultation and she said he'll call.  No expectation of when though.Some questions:1)  I am amazed with the multistep process, no one seems to have this written down.  The perio and dentist are rattling off multi step / multi month process.  I have ADD and OCD... but am I wrong? seems just good customer service to have a sheet detailing that?2)  perios work on gums?  But they pull teeth?   Endontists deal with pain?  But not pull teeth?  And dentist is a generalist?  Doesn't do much of anything than look in mouth 2x a year?3) I spent $700 with the endontist, when I pushed the office staff of perio for something in writing, they gave a $5000 proposal for pull and implant.  I don't know cost for crown and any other costs.  Should it need to be a cobbled together process with 3 different people?!  And don't remember when I'll be eating soft food vs. regualr food, etc...seems complicated and long. I like quick and simple things. MattKW: 1. Sinus pain is unrelated to LOWER molar pain.\n2. If endo finds a crack, then the tooth is unsalvageable. Yes, with consult fee and CBCT, initial access into tooth to find crack, $700 is not unusual. Endos don't pull teeth (except maybe absolute emergency?). They don't carry the instruments, and are well out of usual training.\n3. Perios can advise on implant viability plus assess your general gum condition before you go for implants. They will also perform implant surgery. I co-ordinate with my perio for these reasons. Perios do not always pull teeth but may in implant cases, usu after asking referring general dentist. \n4. General dentists can do lots of things, but need to know limitations. So I do 95% of my own endo, 30% of my own perio, and only the restorative side of the implants (altho I could do implant surgery). Difficult cases or unclear diagnoses get referred to specialists for opinion or treatment for specific issues.\nAfter extraction, the bone has to heal and shrink (remodel) which takes 12 weeks; maybe a bone graft may be needed, thus longer. Only then can you place implant, and usually wait about 8 weeks for bone to heal again. Finally get to do crown. ConfusedPotentialPatient: I love your avatar : )   Great movie!And I really appreciate your comments!  1 other question if you don't mind?I went to another perio after posting this and feel much better dealing with them.Their office staff gave me a booklet for AVSDentalPlan saying that would save me money on the work they would do (the extraction / implant).  If I am going to net save (after sign up fee) after these procedures, it seems a no brainer?  Any opinion on that or other discount plans?

Hence is it more sensible to get used to a denture now rather than spend money on implants, I could afford to pay for 2 implants but I don’t know about continuing to pay for more.I am asking questions here because my dentist is Romanian and wears all the appropriate protective gear and so she is a bit difficult to understand; I am due to see her on Wednesday in 5 days time.Details of my teeth using the 1 to 32 numbering system in the attached diagram:-No 2 was removed in my 20s, so chewing on my right side is not very effective.At the beginning of covid in 2020:-\nNo 15 cracked, but I could not get an appointment for about 6 months, when I eventually obtained an appointment my dentist said there was not much left of the tooth and although she filled it, she said that it cannot be filled again, hence I then tended to chew on the front right corner, around No 27/28.\nLatter, No 3 or possibly 4 cracked, again I could not get an appointment for about 6 months, my dentist filled it, and as before she said that it cannot be filled again.\nTo reduce the strain on my teeth, I then stopping eating nuts and the only meat that I eat is turkey mince, I also avoid eating bread crusts and anything tough.No 24 became loose and fell out 6 months ago, leaving about a 3/32 inch gap, so not really worth having an implant or denture there.The filling in No 28 fell out in February this year, but I could not arrange an appointment until mid April, then 2 weeks ago that stated bleeding when I brushed my teeth, fortunately I had prearranged a checkup for that day and consequently my dentist only had time to put a temporary filling in.  Consequently, I now chew mainly on No 15, so I don’t expect that to last very long, although I am now trying to get used to chewing on the front left corner.I am on blood thinners and so need to have any teeth removed in a hospital and although 15 and 3/4 are not giving any problems at the moment, my dentist has suggested removing 28, 15 and 3/4, but that will make chewing food difficult and hence if 28 can’t be filled then I am tempted to just have that removed and then have a implant or denture in place of No 2 so that I can chew food on the right side of my mouth, and then when necessary have No 15 and No 3/4 removed.I do wonder about getting a second opinion on 15 and 3/4 before I have them taken out?I am in the UK so I don’t know if the Nobel Biocare, Straumann, and Dentsply Sirona implants are available here.I am not in any pain or discomfort at the moment and any further advice or comments would be gratefully received."

Thanks kml1998: How long since you noticed this recession happening bekola: Couple years it's been happening kml1998: You could ask about a gum graft MattKW: The question is, why is this happening? I see similar severe attrition around gum margins of other teeth in photo. This is usually caused by the combination of an acidic diet (soft drinks, sports drinks, citrus fruits,...) and a hard toothbrush used aggressively. Has nothing to do with sugar. Also a possible factor is that the crowns appear quite \"chunky\" (overcontoured), which can distort the way the gums react - usually become swollen and bleed easily."

They performed a  normal filling on a pain free tooth,  which left me in pain immediately after that I still feel now 3 weeks later, and intensifying. They are  now saying that I will need an additonal root canal and crown because „coincidentally“ the tooth is now newly cracked (right after the filling was performed ) and the nerve is now damaged, for some mysterious reason.\nThe dentist claims that the filling and procedure are not the cause of the crack nor pain, but it is due grinding or other trauma.The pain has been persistent since the day of the filling, but when I went back in to have it checked the dentist said it looked good in the X-ray ( not infected, fine) .The tooth mind you, in now sensitive to cold, heat, touch, and the pain has thrones through my scull and jaw.I then mentioned that the corner edges of the teeth seemed too sharp and peaking and particularly sensitive since the filling. We looked at the tooth together with a mirror and that’s when I noticed the large crack, that the dentist had not noticed before.I want to know what is the probable cause of the pain and if the filling was done correctly. And what I should do next.I am apprehensive to have more invasive work done with this clinic. The dentist has prescribed antibiotics which I have finished and Ibuprofen which I have beten taking regularly, which they say is the only measure that can be done until insurance will approve more future procedures. Their root canal specialist only comes in once a month so I will have to  deal with the ongoing pain for yet a little over another month.Should I formally complain?Attached are before and after filling x rays and a photo of the crack itself.I greatly appreciate any advice."

I keep having nightmares that my teeth are falling out. My teeth are pretty bad. I've lost 1 tooth so far, I have, surprisingly, only 2 fillings but the front top teeth are chipped badly and the bottom teeth are grinded to a bad point. I used to have a tongue piercing which didn't help. My teeth are yellow from smoking and eating bad stuff. My jaw hurts from grinding my teeth constantly. I think I grind them during my sleep. I have even tried repairing them with an amazon bought repair kit as I feel like I can't afford to pay for them to get fixed. Maybe it is not that I can't afford them because I probably can from a monthly point of view, I think I won't be able to get the finance to do them as I am turned down for finance constantly.\nI literally have been teaching myself not to smile with my mouth open or speak where my teeth can be seen. I can't even look in the mirror because it depresses me so much. It's come to a point where I minimilise my interaction with people outside of work just so they can't see my teeth. I won't even go on dates. It's literally ruling and ruining my life. I forgot to mention that I have tried to get NHS funding help but I couldn't get any.\nI just don't know what to do. Can anyone give me advise. Is finance a thing for every dentist or can other arrangements be made.\nSomeone help me please. Dr M: Some dentists do make arrangements for payment plans, but this is dentist and case specific. A lot of times, you would need to pay some sort of deposit up front. Unfortunately no Amazon self repair kit is going to be the solution here. You will need to see a dentist, so that a comprehensive treatment plan can be worked out. Discuss alternative cheaper options, if finance is an issue. But the buck stops with you. No one can assist you,if you don't start assisting yourself  first by making that first appointment."

Does anyone have any advice? I've been having a little pain in a tooth but I'm scared to go... MattKW: Ask friends and family for suggestions of a nice dentist. Find a dentist who can offer nitrous oxide (Happy Gas). Also talk to your medical doctor about your anxiety. Make an appointment with the dentist, letting them know of your acute anxiety, and that you don't want to do anything the first time. Go with a friend and meet the receptionist and dentist in the waiting room to have a talk. Have a look around the place; does it have a friendly feel?\nI would then try to get you back a 2nd time to try the nitrous (take a friend) - no examination, no Xrays. With nervous patients I always prefer them to have a trial of nitrous without any treatment - they will relax nicely, and I can adjust the concentration to find your \"happy level\".\nThird time maybe nitrous and a short-acting anxiolytic like triazolam (\"Halcion\") if necessary.

The longer it goes undiagnosed, the worse it will get. Tests to perform on this tooth are: a bitewing radiograph, a FracFinder instrument, and transillumination. emilionorris: If symptoms such as pain or sensitivity are felt when biting or chewing or when exposed to hot or cold temperatures.

At the same time, I started experiencing pain in the tooth with root canal. I had an X-ray with endodontist and a 3D Scan with the doctor who did the veneer and they said everything looked perfect. However, it turned out that I needed a bite adjustment - I was hitting my problematic tooth way too hard. I had 2 bite adjustments and it feels much better but not back to normal yet. It has been 9 days since my 2nd bite adjustment. I wear my nightguard at night and sometimes during the day when I am working from home. I noticed that while I am wearing a nightguard I have absolutely no pain or pressure. Should I wait and see if it improves more and go back for another adjustment?  What else might be causing this pain and pressure in my gums? MattKW: X-rays pls? Taken immediately after RCT was completed, plus the most recent Xray. \nSince you experienced relief after the adjustments, I would be going back for a possible 3rd any time. iartemch: Thank you for your reply. Unfortunately,  I don’t have a copy of the X-ray right after the root canal. I should be able to get it next week.

I am not biting into anything and hoping to give it time to heal. I forgot to mention that since the new veneer installation, it feels like this veneer or tooth is making a popping sound especially after I brush my teeth or press on the tooth from the side. The other veneer is fine.\nAnother thing, when I eat warm food, drink warm tea or water or even take a hot shower, my pain and discomfort go away.\nAt this point, I am really scared because this has been going on since Christmas and  my dentist mentioned that it might be root fracture that requires extraction. She did a CT scan and found nothing either.\n What are the symptoms of root fracture in the tooth with a root canal? Should I get a second opinion from another cosmetic dentist? Should I ask them to remove the veneer and replace it with a temporary veneer to see how my tooth feels? \nI am an anxious person and my anxiety is out of control at this point. I am terrified that I am going to loose my front tooth.\nThank you!"

    "dialogue": "eve072011: Last week, I was eating some popcorn when the top of my back molar came off. It is about a medium sized piece and I can now see behind it, my wisdom teeth is growing horizontally, pushing against it and causing it to have decay and eventually break.I went to the dentist today who has said I have two options. I can leave it or have it removed. She said a filling will not work on this space / area.I don't know what to do as I do not want the tooth removed if I don't have to bit also very worried about it getting infected / lots of food gets stuck in it of I leave it. It doesn't hurt but she did say it has signs of decay.Any help please Dr M: Do you have an x-ray that you can share? We need to see if the tooth is indeed unrestorable or not. eve072011: Hi there thank you so much for getting back. I don't have the x rays but I am going to ask my dentist if I can have a copy of them. The dentist said that the decay is on the back of the tooth and said we can try a filling but it probably won't work.I am really worried if I take the tooth out, it's going to make the molar above it come down and make my teeth shift. It will leave quite a bit gap as I don't have a 3rd molar (wisdom tooth as this is growing sideways) However I am also worried if I leave it, it could get worse later on or get infected. \nIs it ok to leave it in as the dentist offered this as an option or? I am really stressing about this..any help at all would be appreciated. \nThank you"

    "title": "Slight Pressure when Flossing in Between Crowned Tooth",
    "dialogue": "marianne810: I have a crown that was placed about a year ago over a cracked tooth. The tooth had a big composite filling that cracked and the tooth was crowned....no root canal. I noticed today when sticking my finger in between that tooth and the tooth next to it to pick some food out, that there was a feeling of pressure similar to how the tooth felt when it had been prepared without the crown. That sensitive feeling you get when there is no crown on the prepared tooth. Is it normal to essentially feel some of the pain underneath a crown if the crown is pushed on? I don't have bite pain with this tooth, only occasionally if a seed gets caught under it. I should also note that on the other side of the tooth, a space has been forming and is now a food trap. I think my teeth shifted since the crown was placed. I mainly would like to know if some sensitivity might be normal when the crown is pushed on. If not, what steps would need to be taken to figure it out? Which type of xray would be needed for this? Thanks in advance! Dr M: I would suggest going to a dentist for a proper examination. I would suggest taking a peri-apical x-ray. It is not normal for a seed to get caught underneath the crown, since this might be an indication of a leaking crown margin. The tooth will need to be re-evaluated for secondary caries, and if found or if found that the margin is compromised, the old crown would need to be removed in order to manufacture a new crown, with or without a root canal, if the nerve is also involved. MattKW: Not a periapical X-ray - this will only show up periapical changes, e.g. abscess. To check margins you need a perpendicular bitewing X-ray. The fact that your teeth have somehow moved may suggest periodontal issues. Would really need at least an Xray to comment more. marianne810: Thanks for your response!"

It was an extremely unpleasant procedure with lots of rough pulling etc. I was in lot of pain for 4 days afterwards, after which the pain did decrease but I still can’t cope without painkillers. I usually have a very high pain threshold but this is a different level. I have looked carefully at the socket and it appears to be healing well with any bone visibility. Does anyone know if it’s normal to still be in pain after 7 days from this type of extraction? The pain is generally coming from the gum. Thanks in advance Dr M: It depends. Difficult extraction means different things for different people. There are a lot of contributing factors that influence healing-such as systemic conditions, method of extraction, amount of tissue or bone removed etc. I would also not rule out a dry socket yet.

    "title": "Dry Socket",
    "dialogue": "Katie B: On Monday 6th February I had a top back molar removed and a temporary bridge fitted next to it.  My dentist had a problem removing it, loads of tugging  it took a while to come out and broke off in bits, but he said he had got it all out.  Tuesday I was just a bit sore but by Wednesday evening I had unbearable throbbing pain. I went back to the dentist on Thursday and he said that I had dry socket, so I was numbed again and he scraped and packed the socket with a medicated gauze. Then by Thursday night I had the throbbing pain again went back to him again on Friday.  He said he could replace the gauze with another one but I would have to be numbed again, which I didn't want as I was in so much discomfort. I told him I thought it was affecting my sinus too. I was told to keep taking the painkillers (paracetamol & ibuprofen) plus he gave me antibiotics (Metronidazole) to take for 5 days.  My socket is still badly swollen and  very sore.  \nWhat I am concerned about now is the packing in the socket. I have read that it's supposed to be removed  after three to five days. But my next dental appointment isn't until 27th February and that is for the permanant bridge.  I have not been asked to come back to have it replaced or removed. He didn't rinse the socket he scraped it.\nI also read ........... (The insertion step is performed quickly. No anesthetic is used.) The packing is usually renewed (removed, the socket gently rinsed, and the packing then replaced) every 24 to 48 hours, typically for 3 to 6 days.\nSo why was I numbed initially and yesterday when he offered  to change it I would have to be numbed again? MattKW: It's not always necessary to numb when dressing a dry socket, but often it's kinder for the patient. I can then give the socket a good cleansing and packing with an obtundent.\nA second dressing is rare but sometimes necessary. Sounds like you need a redressing.\nThe antibiotics do nothing for a dry socket.\nMany dentists use Alveogyl as a dressing. Yeah, it's OK and convenient, but I prefer my own mixture of zinc oxide eugenol on a cotton pledget. Alveogyl should be removed after 3-5 days so that it is not entrapped in the socket and becomes a foreign body. Usually easily washed out.\nIt's a bit odd to make a permanent bridge so soon. I would leave the temp bridge for at least 10 weeks to allow full healing, shrinkage of the bone, and settling down of any soreness. Katie B: MattKW. Thank you so much for your reply. I have had the packing in since Thursday and it is Sunday now. The gum is very swollen, very sore and throbbing. The thought of having a needle up into my swollen gum and palette! Terrifies me MattKW: Well, you may not need the palatal injection (the stingy one). I would only need you numb enough to make it comfortable, so just the simpler injection on the outside of the tooth may be enough.  \nIt may be fiddly to change the dressing in your case because of the temporary bridge. Katie B: Hello again. Thank you for your reply.  Do you think it would be a good idea to swish salt water around the socket?  My dentist told me on Thursday that maybe I should refrain from this, as this was MAYBE what caused the dry socket in the beginning.  As I used salt water the day after extraction ( maybe to vigorously)  Also what would be the longest time to leave this packing in? As I said earlier I have not been given an appointment to have it removed. MattKW: The idea that vigorous swishing after an extraction is a factor in the formation of a dry socket is balderdash. Even at the Uni where I teach, it is printed on the \"Home Care After Extractions\" sheet, but it's too much of a bureaucratic hurdle to get it changed! \nThe main risk factors for DS are: smoking (before & after), lower extractions, difficult extractions, and the contraceptive Pill. \nSo, you had a difficult extraction and the normal process of creating a clot was overwhelmed by the process of breaking down the clot (plasminogen pathways). \nThere is no sure-fire way to prevent DS, and while salt water (a mild antiseptic) is all very well, the only proven mitigating factor is chlorhexidine mouthwashes for 4 days.\nYes, I would like to make sure the Alveogyl was removed, so give the dentist a call. Katie B: Thank you ...... To be honest I didn't think I swished too vigorously. I think it was the difficult extraction.\nI really appreciate you replying to my messages.  Thank you again. Katie B: Well I phoned the receptionist yesterday and asked about removal of the packing. She asked the dentist and he said no, I said so it will dissolve, yes. \nIt is 8 days now  I had the tooth removed. I am on my last day of Metronidazole (3 a day for 5 days)\nBut I am still very sore, the socket looks red and still swollen.  I really don't want to bother my dentist again \nI don't think there is much more he can do anyway. MattKW: OK, then I don't know what he used. \nAs mentioned before, antibiotics won't do anything.\nGood news - nobody ever died of a dry socket (they just wish they did), and the DS will eventually heal up by itself. If you are managing the pain without reaching the limit of your painkillers, and if you feel it is slightly improving each day, then you can let it run its course. Katie B: Good news - nobody ever died of a dry socket (they just wish they did) <<<< That's for sure!!! I wish I hadn't taken the antibiotics to be honest as they had a lot of side effects too Thank you MattKW"

    "title": "Gum infection",
    "dialogue": "BuckheadJim: Went to a new dentist in Sept. 22, had full xrays. #10 tooth had a shadow around the roots.  This was pointed out to me without any detail as to a problem.  Last week, feeling a sensation in that tooth (not pain) I returned to the dentist.  Another xray and I was advised this is a gum infection and the tooth has a crack.  The tooth was crowned over 30 years ago and there is a post in the tooth.  The dentist gave me the option of an implant or bridge.  I asked about watching and waiting and she said that was an option, gave me a weeks Rx of Amoxicillan 875 and left the room.  Hygenist  said I needed to do something soon or I will lose bone and an implant would not be possible.My concerns are as follows:\nIf the drugs do not clear the infection, what is next?\nHow will I know the drugs have worked since there is no pain?\nWill the infection come back (as the hygenist said)? Hard for me to see how  a cracked tooth within a full crown is causing infection.\nHow will pulling the tooth correct the infection if the drugs do not work to clear it?I prefer to keep the crowned tooth but would accept an implant if necessary.  77 years old  I am strongly leaning toward a second opinion in a few weeks to give the drugs ample time to cure the infection.Any help will be greatly appreciated. Dr M: Firstly it is important to note that antibiotics is never a solution to any problem. The solution would be to get rid of the source of infection, which in your case is the cracked tooth. The tooth has been root canal treated in order for a post to be present. This could be why you are not experiencing any pain at this stage. It is important to note, that as the infection enlarges, pressure builds and this eventually leads to pain. Any root canal treated tooth is technically a dead tooth, and it becomes brittle over time, so there is always a risk of fracture.\nIf the tooth is left in situ, with infection that can recur, there is a risk of bone destruction that can take place. BuckheadJim: Thanks Dr M.  I appreciate your help.  May I ask a follow-up question?  Must I seek immediate care or does the antibiotic buy me a little time to plan for an implant?Thanks again. Dr M: It does buy you a little time yes. But not forever. Hope this info proves to be helpful. BuckheadJim: Thank you. hollybrown: It seems you have a lot of questions and concerns about your current situation, BuckheadJim. If the antibiotics do not clear up the infection, your dentist will likely recommend more aggressive treatments such as root canal therapy or tooth extraction. The only way to know if the drugs have worked is to take another x-ray and see if the infection has cleared. The hygienist is correct that if you wait too long, the infection could spread and cause further damage to surrounding tissues or even lead to bone loss. In terms of watching and waiting, it is essential to keep a close eye on the tooth for any changes in symptoms such as pain, swelling, or sensitivity. If the infection does not clear, your dentist may suggest a root canal or extraction, as these treatments can help prevent further damage and the spread of bacteria. It is also vital that you get a second opinion before making any final treatment decisions. This will give you more insight into other options to help with the infection.

The proposed cost of an implant from my dentist in excess of $5300 assures that.In the meantime, can you suggest how long I should wait for a second xray to determine the effectiveness of the antibiotics?  I finished the 7 day routine on January 30, AM. BuckheadJim: If anyone is interested, I obtained a second opinion and the verdict is quite the same, the tooth needs removal and an implant or bridge is recommended.  However, a possible solution not suggested by the first dentist is a surgical procedure known as an apicoectomy. I have been referred to an endodontist and have an appointment on the 23d.  While the first dentist says the tooth is cracked (which would rule out the apicoectomy) the second dentist did not find it to be cracked.  So I have some possibility of saving the tooth.I will be seeking further information on the costs of a bridge in the event the surgical procedure is not possible.  I have been surprised to find the cost of a bridge to be about the same as an implant (about $5000) as everything I have read suggests the bridge would be much less expensive. MattKW: A bridge will usually cost a bit less than an implant, but the pros and cons are different.\nDoing a bridge will involve drilling back the adjacent teeth for the crowns (of the bridge), and this carries a 5-10% chance of damaging the \"nerve\" (pulp) to the extent that you need to do an RCT! You would need a very good reason to do a bridge on teeth that have never been filled and damaged in the past.\nPlus, you need the 2 teeth supporting the bridge to be fairly upright because the drilling has to be fairly parallel-sided. This is not always possible.\nSo, bridges nowadays are much less frequent since implants were developed. I did bridges quite often 40ya when implants were only just becoming useful; I haven't done one for the past 10 years because implants are usually a better choice.\nP.S. antibiotics only buy you a little bit of time. It would be like taking antibiotics to \"cure\" a splinter in your hand. No, you take out the splinter. Maybe an apico is possible, but most RCTs that fail after 30 yrs (esp with a post) are going to be due to a vertical root fracture. BuckheadJim: Thank you MattKW.  In this case the adjacent teeth already have full metal based crowns.  While I dread the thought of having them removed/destroyed for the purpose of a bridge I would think further removal of tooth would be either minimal or unnecessay.  I am hoping the endodontist can handle the problem with the infection but if not I will need to make a decision soon.  My second dentist recommended the bridge due to the ability to finish the job in short order rather than a multi-month process with the implant.  My number 10 tooth is the problem and numbers 8, 9, 10 and 11 currently have full porcelin covered metal crowns.  Numbers 8 and 9 are over 30 years old and matching the bridge color to the remaining #8 may be a problem with a bridge.So many things to consider. MattKW: Actually, that's quite good. Tooth 10 are always weak teeth, so to have survived 30 years WITH a post is outstanding. Nowadays I often don't crown root-filled 10s, and suggest an extraction and implant instead.\nSo, yes, I'd do a bridge here; very simple. Just cut off old crowns carefully, tidy up the preparations, and get a bridge. Paralleling will not be a problem. So, something good has come out of your senior age and bashed-up old teeth!\nThe procedure would be: Take a temporary impression (model) of the 3 crowns still in place, cut off the crowns on 9 and 11, extract the 10, then make temporary bridge from 9-11. You then should wait at least 10 weeks for the wound to heal, and the bone to shrink. Then you take off temp bridge, tidy up preps, take master impn for bridge, make new temp bridge if necessary. 2 weeks later, cement new permanent bridge.\nColour-matching is easier nowadays, too. Many dentists have digital cameras of some sort which makes it easier to communicate to the lab. If the colours are very hard to match, I send the patient to the lab. BuckheadJim: Thanks for the additional information.  I am not of the belief my dentist plans to use a multi week process to finalize the bridge.  I do like the idea of the gum and bone stabilizing before the final work is done and I will surely ask about that. MattKW: Yes, it is essential to wait. After an extraction, the wound will achieve initial gum healing within 2 weeks. But the bone will collapse slowly (remodel) over 10 weeks until it stabilises. If a permanent bridge is made too quickly after the extraction, then as the bone remodels, you will get an unattractive and annoying gap under the bridge. This would be very unsightly for a front tooth. And that's assuming the tooth comes out easily. \nWorst case scenario is that your tooth is fragile, and you are not young, so root-filled teeth often fracture, which might necessitate a surgical extraction and loss of even more bone. It may even need a bone graft to rebuild the correct shape before making the permanent bridge. \nThere is no real problem leaving a temporary bridge for this length of time. The only thing is that rather using a soft temporary glue which is only designed to last 2 weeks (for the temp bridge), I suggest the dentist use a semi-permanent glue (zinc phosphate is nice) or a permanent glue. Yes it'll be a bit more fiddly for him in 10 weeks time, but at least it won't fall out until things are ready. BuckheadJim: My wife had an appointment with our dentist today and I had her inquire about the time span between temporary and permanent bridge placement.  Answer: 8-10 weeks.  Makes me feel better about the plan.  I still have hopes that I may qualify for the apiocoectomy \nand save the tooth. Thanks again for all your information."

It seems not every dentist uses the valves that prevent this. Am I overreacting? My dentists have never stopped me from closing around the ejector tip which supposedly triggers the backflow. I have OCD and this has been a triggering discovery for me. MattKW: Saliva ejectors do not backflow. Perhaps you are thinking of the handpiece (drill) or the water syringe (triplex).\nThe amount of backflow into a drill is minimal, and would be contained within the drill, which is going to be cleaned and sterilised anyway. Most modern handpieces have anti-backflow valves, so it would be impossible.\nTriplexes could also have some backflow. But, as for handpieces, it will be minimal and contained within the triplex tip which is removed after the patient and either cleaned and sterilised (metal tips) or thrown away (plastic tips).\nAll waterlines are flushed and disinfected daily.\nTo give you an idea, I found an old worksheet from when I owned my practice (2013) attached.\nIf you can find any instances of patients getting cross-infection from suctions, handpieces, or triplexes, let me know.\nI think good dental surgeries are much more aware and proactive with cleanliness than some doctors I've seen."

    "dialogue": "Anxious person: Hello, \nI have a quick question about traumatized front teeth. I've already visited my dentist and they told me that the teeth don't looked cracked (although the bottom one may be a small chip) and that the pain I'm experinceing is probably due to impact trauma the teeth had. I recently bit on a fork while I was having dinner and 2 days later the gums surrounding the tooth swelled up (mainly on the back on the roof of my mouth). I have a history of gingivitis and so I origionally thought it was just a flare up from that but when I had more pain in the tooth and it was spreading to other teeth I became worried and went to go see the dentist. Anyway so as I'm having dinner tonight I noticed I wasn't even able to bite on anything with the affected teeth and now the bottom tooth is starting to have more sensitivity (which wasn't there before). I'm just worried that they may have missed something in my check up as I was origionally worried about a cracked tooth. My main question is what differentiates the pain from a cracked tooth to just a traumatized tooth (as that's what the dentist told me my teeth are experincing). Also shouldn't they have done something to the tooth they suspected was chipped? They did say it was something they are going to moniter. They did spray some kind of liquid on the teeth (it tasted like mouthwash with a really bad after taste) but I'm not really sure what it was supposed to do so any help with that would be greatly appreciated Ps. I generally have bad anxiety so when I hyperfixate on something I'll overthink it to death. So it is a possibility that I'm just over reacting but I thought another opinion wouldn't hurt Dr M: Good dayIf it is indeed a traumatized tooth, the periodontal ligament of the tooth could have become inflamed. In such a case, we usually advise a soft diet for about 2 weeks, with some anti-inflammatory medication. If the pain persists, then there is a possibility of irreversible nerve damage and/or a related gum issue.\nAdditional investigation is then needed. Anxious person: Thanks so much for the help, the pain had significantly subsided since yesterday but I am still experincing some sentivity especially after a meal and I can still feel there is inflammation on the roof of my mouth. I am a little more concerned about the chip in the bottom tooth than anything else right now but I am going back for a cleaning in a few weeks so I'll address all those issues then. Thansk so much for your help it really helped put my mind at ease .

    "dialogue": "Outsider626: I apologize in advance if I'm posting this under incorrect forum. Feel free to move the thread. My question is as follows: I had a root canal procedure done on the 1st molar (#30) a month ago. Went to my general dentist to get a crown on it and he kind of refused to do it, saying that now he sees that tooth # 29 also needs a root canal. I went to the Endo that that did my initial root canal for a second opinion, and after looking at x-rays he said that tooth # 29 is healthy and there is no need to touch it. Apparently my general dentist wants me to get a root canal done on a tooth that doesn't bother me because 1st molar (#30) doesn't have enough tooth structure left for a crown. Have no idea why he didn't tell me that straight up. Now I'm not sure what to do. Implant procedure is pretty expensive. But than again I don't want to touch the tooth that doesn't bother me so that a dental bridge can be made. Are there any other alternatives? What would you recommend? Thanks! MattKW: I'd go to another dentist for an opinion. I don't understand why your current dentist wants to do an RCT on a tooth the endo is happy about. \nAs for #30, the dentist should have assessed the strength of the tooth before sending you off for an RCT. Sometimes weak teeth can be saved with an RCT followed by posts and a big filling (composite or amalgam) if a crown won't work, but again, this is to be discussed before going to an endo.\nAny Xrays to show us?

To answer all 3 points:1. My assumption is that he wants to do it because apparently after RCT there is not enough tooth structure left on tooth # 30 for a crown to attach to. I guess he wants to do a dental crown bridge. That's why he told me to get a RCT on tooth next to it (#29) that doesn't bother me at all. But again he did not tell me that there is not enough tooth structure left on (#30). He just sent me to my Endo for another RCT. Meanwhile Endo said that tooth is in good shape and no need for RCT. And he said that maybe he sent me to him for another RCT because not enough tooth structure left on tooth #30 and he want's to bridge it together for a stronger hold.2. Yeah he did not do that. I showed him a printout of an X-ray and he said that he sees some dark spots on it (Cavity I guess?). He said it's a matter of time until you will need a RCT, and that I should do it now since I have insurance that will cover it. Than told to comeback and he will place crowns.3. Not a great xray but do you think it's still possible to put a crown on tooth # 30 if he creates some sort of structure with composite or amalgam?I'll get a better x-ray from my Endo to whom I went for 2nd opinion and post it on Tuesday."

I do floss, brush and use mouthwash every day. Something else i need to do? I also wear my retainers every night. Im not sure if theres any more information you need, so just ask. Also my parents have a lot of issues with cavity and salivary stones. Is this something i can grab with genes? Its mostly likely bcs of lack of dentist and money and all that stuff from their childhood. They do not smoke or tobacco. Neither do i. I dont drink alcohol. Only meds are the adhds and no known health issues MattKW: Really a mild hairy tongue caused by long filamentous papillae. You don't have to do anything about it. My old Oral Med Prof used to suggest that patients slice up a papaya (or pineapple) lengthways, put on a smear of honey for 5 mins, then chew up thoroughly. I think he was hoping that the papain would soften up the \"hairs\". Never had the chance to find out how well it worked.\nThe white spots are mild flourosis. There is no whitening toothpaste out there that will help anyone with fluorosis, so save your money and buy standard t'paste. If you eventually bleach your teeth, it will only make the yellowness of your teeth lighten a bit - you will still have the more obvious fluorosis.\nIf you live in a fluoridated water supply, then a fluoride mouthwash is also a waste of money. Just drink tap water."

    "dialogue": "PleaseHelp: I’m at my wits end and I don’t know where else to go to help my mother. She is in her late 70’s. Had all of her teeth removed and bridges implanted, root canals were done before bridges but were incomplete because dentist who did all the procedures was not a root canal specialist. All of this was done overseas while on vacation during the pandemic. After returning, she complained of her gums being in extreme pain. Took her to the dentist and we decided that all the work that was done had to be removed; now toothless and getting ready for dentures. Even after the removal of her implants she complained that her gums were still in a lot of pain; there’s a protrusion on the bottom of her gums, any pressure causes her pain. I complained to her dentist but he said it was probably swelling and the pain will subside. A year later she’s still in pain, so I took her to another dentist and I was told there’s nothing that can be done. If anyone knows which specialist she needs to see to ease her pain please let me know. I don’t know who else or where else to turn to. Thanks. Dr M: Good dayA photo will definitely help in this case as well as any post extraction xrays. Does your mom suffer from any other systemic conditions? Diabetes etc? The bony protrusion could be a bony specule, although this should have resorbed by now, or it could be a retained root left in situ? \nYou could also seek a second opinion from a periodontist or oral medicine specialist. MattKW: Yes, unlikely to be within the realm of a general dentist. I'd go to a Oral-Maxillo-Facial specialist or similar to check for obvious dental issues (e.g. excessive bone loss overlying mental nerve) , and who may then refer her to a neurologist or pain clinic as he sees fit. Sometimes the pain cannot be removed entirely but needs management (e.g. drugs, psychology). I'd be interested to hear what happens in the long run."

The sensitivity lasts <5 seconds and it goes away, there are no other issues. It almost feels like a “snap” of pain and the sensitivity  goes away almost immediately. There has been no improvement and it hasn’t gotten worse.  I got my part of my filling replaced (at my request) 2 weeks ago. The doctor only replaced the side of my filling, not the filling on top of the nerve. I said I just wanted to replace that side because it was cracked and I was hoping the sensitivity would go away after that. I was wrong and it didn’t help at all. I went back to the dentist and he refused to replace my whole filling because he didn’t want to keep drilling in the tooth and referred me to an Endodontist for a root canal. He said he’s a specialist and will do some 3D imaging or something so I can know for sure if I need one or not. I feel like my case is borderline and I’d rather not get a root canal if I can help it. I’ll get one if I really NEED it, but the only issue I have is sensitivity to hot/cold that goes away after a few seconds. My dentist said my nerve is close to the top of my tooth and that’s why it’s sensitive. I feel like I’m not going to know for sure unless I get the whole thing replaced. If I keep drilling in my tooth will it make my sensitivity worse? I’ve had 2 fillings done in the past 10 weeks on that tooth. What will an Endodontist do differently than a dentist? Will he just immediately say I need a root canal because I was referred or will he examine my tooth on a case by case basis? On the referral my dentist wrote “evaluate 29 and treat as necessary”"

If you tried to shave them down, it would seriously damage your teeth and biting function.\nYour lateral incisors are a bit smaller (\"peg laterals\") than desired, and this is what makes the canines look pointy.\nThe simplest way to improve this is with composite veneers, an nice example of which I put here. Composite resin can last for many years, and has the advantage of being repaired easily if they chip.\nSome people might suggest porcelain veneers - my advice is to keep it in composite for as long as possible, maybe your lifetime (KISS). Porcelain veneers cannot be easily repaired/replaced and usually mean permanent alteration of your teeth; there is no going back to virgin tooth as is possible with composites. \nAlso, as you age, you will probably have some gum recession which would show the join between tooth and composite (or veneer).

The socket preservation probably is the bone preservation procedure, entails placing new bone materials in the socket of the extracted tooth. Is the socket preservation necessary after an upper molar extraction if the dental implant is planned? In addition, what type of the bone material is the best for the upper #3 tooth socket (upper jaw) preservation procedure? Thank you for your help. MattKW: You won't necessarily know if it will be a simple extraction (or a surgical) until you get a grip on it. I have worked for 40 years and extracted 15,000+ teeth yet sometimes get a surprisingly hard (or easy) tooth which I wasn't expecting. Upper and lower first molars are usually very weak by the time they require extracting."

    "title": "Crown Issues - two months later...",
    "dialogue": "BlakeVic: Hello,I'm 41 and have a history of grinding. Two months ago, I received a zirconia / layered with porcelain crown on #19. During the following six weeks I had strained muscles in my back, limited range of motion in my neck, headaches, tooth pain/sensitivity to hot/cold and chewing as well as jaw alignment issues. Eventually, my bite guard broke in the exact spot that the crown was placed. At that point, the dentist determined the crown was too high and drilled it down.1. After adjustment the surface of the crown felt like sandpaper and is now whiter than before. The dentist went back and polished the surface but I'm still concerned that the porcelain layer was drilled. Can adjusting a crown this way affect the appearance? Also, I clench and grind. Will the altered surface impact my opposing teeth?2. I still cannot chew or drink hot, cold fluids without pain. Also, in the last couple of weeks, I've developed a dull, cold aching sensation in the crowned tooth. The dentist says it could take six months for the sensitivity to settle. He's also said it's possible I have an infection but has declined to prescribe medication because he says there are no other signs. He does not think I need a root canal. We have a follow up in a couple of weeks to see if the adjustment fixes the pain. But, if the pain and sensitivity persist what could be the problem?The two months of the crown being too high threw my bite off. The dentist wants to drill my other teeth to balance. I do not want my other teeth manipulated until we determine what is going on with the crowned tooth. I've considered going to a new dentist and starting this process over. I have consulted other dentists and been told I may need a root canal, new crown, Invisalign...In addition to the questions above, does anyone have thoughts, recommendations on how I should move forward with this situation?Thank you. Dr M: 1) Adjusting the crown definitely affects the porcelain layer. If it is not rough, it should not affect the occlusion with your other teeth. Getting the bite correct is more important.2) The pain could be related to a lot of things. Difficult to say without an x-ray. If the pain does not subside, a root canal would be the next step. This can be done through the crown, but there is also a chance that the crown would need to be replaced. BlakeVic: Dr M said:\t\t\t1) Adjusting the crown definitely affects the porcelain layer.

Thank you.I've provided some prepped, crowned X-rays and a photo of original tooth. A few follow up questions, please:1. The surface of my crowned tooth is visibly whiter. I'm assuming this is because of the drilling. My understanding is that the porcelain is used to match color. Is that correct? Is it common practice to drill this type of crown or should it have been replaced?2. Regarding my original tooth, there was zero pain to chewing, sensitivity to liquids. I had a dull ache and occasional sensitivity to air (breathing) for six weeks leading up to the crown. I was told the divot was too large to fill and that my grinding could eventually crack the tooth. In the last couple of weeks a dull and cold ache has returned, chewing issues persist and sensitivity to cold almost feels like it's getting worse. The dentist keeps telling me the X-rays look good and sensitivity could last six months. He has mentioned the possibility of infection but says there are no other signs. I'm aware that grinding can extend and complicate the healing process but I grind at night and wear a custom fitted guard. Do you have any additional thoughts?3. I had braces when I was younger. Prior to this crown the dentist described my bite as \"perfect\". He now wants to drill my molars (opposite the crown) to try and balance my bite. Is that a good idea? I declined with hopes that after the adjustment my bite will settle (the crown was too high for two months before adjustment). If my bite doesn't settle, would ortho treatment balance it? I'd be more open to something like Invisalign as opposed to drilling my healthy teeth.Thanks again."

But on the bottom side it still connected so it has to be tooth eruption pushing the bridge up and breaking it. shawnmcc: I now have dentist appointment I was wondering till then what can I do to get stuff out from under my 30 year old bridge tooth. What popped the cyst was a probe I was using to remove stuff till fixed which popped the eruption cyst. Also the reason I have bridge I think is because I had calcification or plaque coming from under the gum line which replaced my first molar by pushing it back then my dentist drilled what he thought was cavity plowing the plaque away. Leaving space makin him think he goofed."

    "dialogue": "jamie5jw: Hi everyone,My 1st post here so apologies if it's a bit muddly.I've been told I need a crown/veneer on a 1st molar on the top and the bottom jaw as I've got some fractures and I've been priced up for emax ones.I've had a little look online and I've kept coming across sites and people saying that emax isn't best used for a molar and zirconia would be a much better option for certain reasons so I'm confused as to why the dentist suggested emax.Is emax or zirconia a better option for the molars?Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Jamie. Dr M: Good dayZirconia crowns are stronger, and can withstand more occlusal force than Emax crowns. I would evaluate your overall \"bite\"  and looks for signs of potential grinding. If there are signs, I would consider going for Zirconia crowns. A lot of dentists opted for Emax above Zirconia, since they are more aesthetic, but modern Zirconia crowns are also highly aesthetic. I would talk to your dentists and ask about Zirconia crowns as an option-the price difference should not be much."

No infection. I finally went to oral surgeon who could not see any issues on CBCT I provided from the Endo. He said pain could be from micro fracture or missed accessory canal.All of the doctors besides the oral made me feel bad for wanting to get the tooth extracted, but I felt like I had no choice. I got the tooth extracted last Monday.I feel like it has been progressing well. I am keeping up on my hygiene and meds. I do feel slight “heartbeat” in the extraction area throughout the day when I’m more stressed, etc. I also feel discomfort from what I think are the stitches (non dissolving).

Busybee: It can take a root filled tooth quite a while to settle, but I had a similar experience with a front tooth.  It was root filled through a crown 20 years ago and it was not until that crown was replaced that the main symptoms went (I kept thinking that the root canal was failing).  When I had a bite adjustment  and new crown it became really painful, but that was until the crown was shortened and my bite corrected tered to stop me hitting it.  It didn't really help that I have kept bruising it over the years by accidentally knocking a cup or glass into it.  Root filled teeth that are crowned just aren't as strong but some teeth that have had work are weaker than others.  Teeth can take months to settle after work.   Give it a few more months and try to take the pressure off by avoiding biting on it for a few days and a nightguard when you sleep.  The ligaments around the tooth can really hurt if they are bruised. boris: Thanks for the reply. Dentist checked the bite and the tooth doesn't touch another. \nI was told that once the crown and metal post is fitted then thats permanent and can't be removed. \nI'll wear a bite guard day and night for a few weeks, just remove for eating.

I thought I had taken all of them out, but I thought wrong. One of the toothpicks had slid down into the burrito. I took a huge bite and bit into it on my left side.For the last week, I haven't been able to eat on the left side of my mouth. Every tooth on my left side feels sore and swollen. I went to my dentist and they did an x-ray and they said they didn't see any cracked teeth, but that the teeth could still be cracked. Could anyone help me out? My gums also feel sore and swollen. This has been going on for a week now. Donnie K: I can tell you what you have probably done. You have probably sprained the PDL ligaments around your teeth. It is very painful and lingers for a very LONG time. I had a root canal done in October and on a follow up visit the Endodontist had me bite down on a bite stick to check my bite. I bit down hard on it and since that time I still have sensitivity around that tooth. This will not show up on an X ray but is very painful and takes a VERY long time to recover from. I've had my dentist do special X rays to check for cracks or anything unusual, when I had my temp crown put on a month ago. I recall that I had this happen with a previous root canalled tooth 6 years ago. The best they could tell me was avoid chewing on that side and give it time. It is three months now and still flares up quite a bit. I hope you have more patience than me because this has been my own personal dental hell. I've found that muscle relaxers seem to help more than Advil for me. Good luck. janks: Thank you!

    "dialogue": "AlexG_308: Hi all,6 weeks ago, I accidentally bit down hard on a cherry pit. My upper left teeth were sore for about a week but completely resolved. Unfortunately, about a week later, I re-aggravated the area while eating chips. It wasn't too bad for the first couple days but then I got sick and the constant aching in those teeth increased.I saw my dentist after 1 week and he performed tests, took an X-ray and CBCT but couldn't find anything wrong. I continued to wait it out and went back 3 weeks later for my cleaning. He took another look and x-ray but still couldn't find anything wrong.It's now been 4 weeks of constant mild-moderate aching in these teeth. I'd say the pain is often sitting around a 4/10 lately. The pain is sometimes significant enough that I have trouble getting to sleep but once I'm asleep, it doesn't usually bother me and feels best first thing in the morning upon waking up. However, once I brush my teeth, the aching and soreness begins again and continues throughout the day. The teeth feel tender and I've been avoiding chewing on that side for these past 4 weeks. I feel the need to be careful while talking not to bump these teeth. I haven't noticed any temperature sensitivity. OTC anti-inflammatory medications have maybe helped minimally but don't eliminate the pain. I have a dentist-made night guard that I wear nightly.I should mention that I have chronic neuropathic pain in my teeth on the other side that started after dental work 2.5 years ago, however, I no longer have any temperature sensitivity or trouble chewing with those teeth. It's just a constant ache that I can usually ignore, which feels different from this new problem. I got off all nerve meds earlier this year as I felt I could handle the chronic pain without them.I suppose my question is could a bruised tooth be taking this long to resolve or could this possibly be a sneaky crack causing all this? These teeth have no fillings so a crack would seem drastic.I suppose there's not much more I can do right now other than wait, but I'm going on vacation in 1.5 weeks and I'm concerned this is going to affect my enjoyment of the trip"

    "dialogue": "BlakeVic: Hello, I'm 41 and have a significant bruxism issue. Two-and-a-half weeks ago I had a zirconia layered with porcelain crown placed on #19. Since then I have seen three dentists (including the doctor who did the work) because of pain. All three have agreed that the crown is seated properly, my bite is healthy and x-rays look good. The tooth has been examined (tapped) with no problems. And my night guard has been examined, determined to be in good condition. However, I still have sensitivity to cold on the inside of the crown. Moreover, there is a dull pain (sometimes sharp) when I chew. Also, I'm still having headaches, and in the evening/night my teeth ache - especially the crowned molar. Twice I've woke up in the morning with a strained trap muscle (left side - same as crown) that has limited my mobility for days at a time. I was told the head, neck and back pain is a result of grinding, but I never had head, neck or back pain prior to this crown. I hate to think headaches, neck and back pain are going to be a new normal. If my bite is okay could this be the result of grinding on the zirconia, porcelain material? I wanted a gold crown and was talked into the layered zirconia instead. I've considered having the current crown replaced but due to the chewing pain the dentists I've consulted believe the nerve is still fragile and want to give it more time to heal (or determine a root canal is needed). I'm in pain and it's affecting my day-to-day as well as my sleep. Any thoughts are appreciated. Thank you. Dr M: Good dayDid your dentist only take normal x-rays or was a CBCT scan also taken? \nDo you perhaps have any x-rays you could share? honestdoc: What were you experiencing before you had the crown #19?

You'll notice significant wear from grinding - which included a divot that ran front to back on the buccal side. The tooth had been symptomatic for a couple of years. During times that I was grinding harder than usual it would ache for a few days, week and then go away. However, this time the ache lasted for six weeks and eventually became sensitive to air (occasionally, breathing would cause a light but zinging sensation).I was told the due to my history of grinding the tooth could not be filled (filling, inlay, onlay, bonded). It was explained the previous methods mentioned and/or further grinding could lead to fracture, and that a crown was my best option. In your opinion, does this present as a tooth that needed crowing?Also included are scans showing my tooth before and after prep - as well as the tooth with the crown on it.It has been one month since the crown was seated. The chewing sensitivity has improved but continues to be present. Sensitivity to hot is almost non-existent. However, sensitivity to cold persists.The scans do not show it but the inside of my tooth was prepped on an angle. That is where the tooth is sensitive to cold. I am concerned that the prep damaged the nerve. The owner of the practice where the procedure was preformed advised it may take six months for the root to calm down. I did seek a third opinion and was told if the sensitivity continues beyond two or three months a root canal may be needed. My tooth had significant wear from grinding but did not shows signs or have a history of fracture, chipping, cavity, etc.Is it common for this type of situation to result in needing root canal treatment? Would a need for root canal cause headaches?The dentist believes that at 41 years old, after two-plus-decades of grinding (and never having headaches, neck and back pain) that in the 24 hours after the crown was placed my body developed new symptoms to grinding: headaches, neck and back pain. However, he does not think those symptoms are related to the crown or tooth. I'm struggling with that assessment. He has referred me to a TMJ specialist.My night guard fits my top teeth. The crown is on my bottom. I was told it shouldn't cause an issue but I have stopped wearing it temporarily as to test if it's causing the headaches.

Your thoughts are welcomed and appreciated.Attachments​ honestdoc: In my opinion, the custom night guard is going to help 2 ways.  According to the pioneer of TMJ studies, Dr. Jeffrey Okeson at the Univ of Kentucky, your teeth should only touch each other for about 20 minutes a day.  When you're at rest, your teeth are about a quarter inch apart.  When your teeth are clenched together, they will be subjected to tremendous stress and your muscles will be at tension.  With the muscles in tension, you will get headaches.  How you know you need a root canal is if you have intense pain that can wake you at night and unbearable pain to temperatures.  That would indicate the nerve is damaged.  Another indication is if you have swelling which means your nerve had died and became infected.  If you feel cold and it goes away within a few seconds, then the nerve is good.The prep looked good.  Unfortunately, any drilling causes trauma to the nerve and prepping for crowns require a lot of drilling.  That means the nerve is most likely injured and inflamed.  It is best not to overwhelm the nerve with too much cold to allow it to heal. BlakeVic: Thank you for such a thoughtful reply, doc.I'll continue to monitor the nerve and be patient with its healing. It helps to hear that you think the prep looks good. I'm hoping to stop the headaches that started after the crown was placed. I'll be taking my current custom guard to see the TMJ specialist at month's end.Thanks again!"

    "title": "Would Zirconia be the right way to go?",
    "dialogue": "tonightwetaco: Thank you for taking a look at my issue.Recently I suffered an accident to both of my incisors. One was broken in half and will require a crown while the other has a chip on the bottom side of the tooth next to the other incisor. 2 dentists recommended crowns and do not feel a filling will solve the problem for either tooth.One dentist offered PFM while the other recommended Zirconia. After researching both I believe Zirconia would be best if I develop gum recession. I do not want to see exposed metal.Question:\n1. is this a sound decisions?\n2. which type or Zirconia is recommended for the two front teeth?Thank you! honestdoc: Great questions!  I would go for Full Contour Zirconia (fake diamond).  PFMs tend to look too opaque and the Porcelain layer over the metal tends to fracture.  There are many grades of Zirconia ranging from the most durable (less esthetic) to the most esthetic (less durable).  The dentist needs to evaluate your bite and assess the risks of fracture.  If you have high risks of fracture, you may need to opt for the most durable.  Emax crowns are very Hollywood esthetic, but they are not durable and will likely fracture. tonightwetaco: Thank you for your input, honestdoc. My bite has been evaluated as low risk for fracture. The dentist is currently inquiring as to the grades of Zirconia produced by his lab. Hopefully, they offer the most advanced options presently available.What is the best aesthetic grade of Zirconia? What are the top 3 best aesthetic grades HAHA.Thank you for your continued help honestdoc: There are many grades.  Keep in mind the more esthetic grade Zirconia, the less strong and more likely to fracture. tonightwetaco: is it correct that even the most esthetic grade of Zirconia is stronger than Emax, PFM or a real tooth?Can you tell me what the most esthetic grades are called? honestdoc: I've included a link about zirconia.     https://www.ddslab.com/zirconia-in-dentistry/ Keep in mind that different dental labs have their proprietary products or vendors. brushandfloss: Yes, you're correct. Even the most esthetic zirconia is much stronger than e.Max and the real tooth. These are measured in megapascal for strength and generally the more esthetic and translucent will have a lower MPa. You'd be looking for the more esthetic zir. since it's an anterior restoration. Ideally, you might want to look for a multi-layer which has up to 1,200 MPa and less translucent toward the margin and layers down to 500-700 MPa and much more translucent. The majority of labs will use zirconia since it's very esthetic and stronger than e.Max. You'll find e.Max mostly in office that offer crowns made in the dental office due to the machines their using and no need for a long \"sinter.\" Zirconia is \"sintered\" at high heats over long duration to keep the esthetics but get the strength.  \ne.Max for refence now offers 500 MPa with a new version, up from the 260-300 previously. Higher=stronger. Right now, there's more zirconia brands and companies to keep track. I wouldn't get caught up asking the Dr. or lab the brand of zir. but maybe ask to see some previous cases and pictures. Also, you can ask to visit the lab for a shade. The lab should be able to have you visit and match the shade of you existing teeth though a VITA shade guide. tonightwetaco: thank you brushandfloss, wouldn't the dental office be able to decide the shade? I like the idea of visting the lab but I have a feeling the dentist will look at me like im nuts. thoughts? tonightwetaco: spoke with my dentist and they recomended something like EMax as it is the most aesthetic. I asked them about strength and she told me not to bite anything harder than a raw carrot. Does that sound about right?i am considering asking her about the most aesthetic zirconia her lab offers tonightwetaco: my understanding is that the dentist not only thinks emax will be the most aesthetic but she also thinks Zirconia might damage my teeth, I assume this is do to bite. i am scared to get Emax because I have chewed the way I chew for my entire life on this planet and now I am going to spend $3,000 for 2 crowns that could break that afternoon if I don't change my lifestyle immediately.... honestdoc: I would get an esthetic grade Full Contour Zirconia.  I would strongly consider custom bite guard.  If your dentist disagrees, see a different dentist.  Zirconia does not damage the opposing teeth to the degree conventional porcelain does.  You can protect them with the custom guard. tonightwetaco: than you, honestdoc. The dentist told me that her concern is the tooth beneath the crown breaking if i go with something as sturdy as zirconia. She said the Emax will be very strong and I should be able to eat normally but I shouldnt bite silverware. she remarked that using our front teeth isn't really necessary and most people should be chewing with the backteeth."

Dr M: Good dayLooks like a odontoma, probably compound odontoma. This is classified as a hamartoma, which means it has limited growth potential. Usually we only monitor and only treat if symptomatic or if it causes problems with adjacent structures.\nIn your case, only monitor the lesion. Funnytooth: Thank you so much, that is so helpful!

    "dialogue": "Scorp: So recently I've moved to my hometown, a smaller city in central Europe. And finding a dentist online has been difficult. I've seen some dreadful offices that look like they're from the past, but most importantly I feel like dentistry here hasn't caught up to the modern dentistry.In the end I did go to a dentist and got some work done, and now I have problem with a crown, but I'll open a separate thread for that.There are things I find dentists here do which I don't necessarily agree with, and toys that no one here seems to have.1) I've called about 10 dental offices, only 1 has Cerec same-day crowns technology (their office looks like crap)\n2) No one has a T-scan (to check occlusion). So they just use the paper thing, which isn't as accurate\n3) No one takes prints for crowns digitally. They all use the outdated and not as accurate paste in your mouth for the model\n4) Most don't put a temporary crown in while you're waiting for your permanent crown. I feel this can mess up your gums as well as the adjescent teeth.\n5) They're all \"1 dentist does everything\" places. Shouldn't the root canal be done by the root canal specialist? The crown by the crown specialist? etc etcKeep in mind, these are only things I noticed as a patient with decent experience with dentists in my 32 years.The only bright side is that dentists here cost about 40% less than the ones in the capital city.But I feel as though I'm living in the past. I want the accurate model so that my crown comes out a perfect fit. I want the temporary crown so that my teeth don't move even a millimeter. I want the temporary crown so that my gums retain their shape while I wait for the permanent crown. And I want my occlusion to be checked digitally after a crown or a filling is done, to make sure that my bite is correct all the way.So what do you guys think? Maybe I'm paranoid, I don't know. But should I just eat up the cost and invest my time to go to the capital city, where I'll get the latest and greatest?Thanks"

It’s my bottom 1st molar and I’ve got a big amalgam filling in it, that I’ve had for years.It’s too difficult to take a picture of the tooth as it’s the back of the tooth that broke but I’ve attached a picture of the part that broke off, if that will help at allThere’s no pain it just feels weird as my tongue keeps noticing it! Unfortunately it’s happened on a bank holiday weekend in England for the Queen’s funeral…so it isn’t easy to get dental appointment for the next couple of days.Is this something I should get checked out now or can it wait for a couple of days? If it can wait, is there anything I should or shouldn’t do to help it?Also, I clench and grind my teeth, could that have cause the tooth around the big filling to become even weaker? I have never been told that there was a crack and never felt anything until the tooth broke off.Thanks for any help and advice. honestdoc: Unfortunately I see this too often.  The amalgam is stronger than the tooth holding it.  The larger the amalgam filling, the weaker the surrounding tooth structure.  The dentist usually preps the tooth for an undercut to retain the filling.  The undercut weakens the cusps and fractures are very common.  The most common fractures on lower molars are on the tongue side.If you can see your dentist soon, you should be fine.  The problem is the sharp, rough surfaces can irritate and damage the tongue.  Long term irritation to the tongue is very bad and can lead to formation of abnormal tissue (precancer) called hyperkeratosis (callouses).  If the dentist requires you to have a crown and you cannot afford it, have him/her smooth the area so it doesn't feel sharp or rough to your tongue.  I will guess that any temporary filling will not stay on and will flake off again. Dental1234: honestdoc said:\t\t\tUnfortunately I see this too often.

I’m trying to keep my tongue away from it. Why are the fractures usually on the tongue side? Does the tongue or more saliva etc help weaken it?Is Tuesday soon enough to phone up for an urgent appointment (as long as I don’t develop pain)? Or should it be before Tuesday? Most dentists won’t be open on Monday because of the Queen’s funeral.I have 1 other tooth with a quite a big amalgam filling. I’ve actually had that one in longer than the tooth that broke today….but is there anything in particular I can do to try and strengthen the tooth? honestdoc: On lower molars, the dominant guiding cusps are one the cheek (buccal) side.  The weaker cusps are on the tongue (lingual) side.  It is the opposite on top posteriors where the cheek side cusps on molars tend to break.  On the top bicuspids (premolars) it depends on the size and location of the fillings.  You should be fine since short term irritation usually resolves.There are nothing you can do to strengthen your teeth other than preventing cavities.  If you grind and or clench, consider night guards over-the-counter (less expensive but one size fits all) or custom made.  If it starts to deteriorate, you may need a crown (not the queen's).

My dentist when I was younger my dentist mistook this for my old tooth broken for some reason. They pulled it out my mouth when I was in my 30s and thought it was a tooth then too.

It is also a soft splint but very rigid much more so than I ever felt my first one. I am a clencher. The force of my clenching seems to have increased by a factor of 2 or 3 with the new splint. I have a very severe case of clenching by any standard. The damage to my lower jaw is like someone took a jack hammer to it. I am covered in exostosis since wearing the new splint. I maybe had one or two with the old one. I am going crazy. I have visited three dentists for second opinions and no one knows. My primary dentist says don't worry your teeth are looking great. I'm afraid to sleep. I'm on anxiety meds. What is doing on here? Today we checked load on each tooth via articulating paper and all looked ok. The splint feels like it's made of glass it's so hard. Is it just me? Am I just such a severe case that even a splint can't help me? I have damage to my gums (inflamed) and jaw bone like someone who never wore a splint in their lives. Help! Dr M: Good dayIt is is extremely unlikely that you developed exostosis over a short period. In severe grinding, it is often recommended that a rigid splint such as a Michigan bite plate is used. Soft occlusal splints often contribute to more grinding, since they give way as you bite into them.\nIf you are still struggling with grinding, it might be a good idea to also consider muscle relaxants which you take at night before bed, or to consider evaluation of your TM-joints."

    "title": "Am I headed for serious problems with my teeth?",
    "dialogue": "jb220: Basically, I'm in my mid 30's, I have one root canaled lower molar and a bunch of composite fillings. I think they're medium to large sized, but not sure. I've gotten more and more serious about oral hygiene, to the point of obsessiveness, since my root canal.The thing is: I keep reading about how composites are leaky and fail after relatively short periods and worrying I've done irreparable damage. It used to just be a worry in the back of my mind, but its actually been causing me a lot of anxiety over the last few weeks. My last filling was in 2018, and so far I haven't needed any new work since I started flossing nightly. I think I have at least one filling on a premolar thats facing the tooth next to it (I think you call this Class II) directly on top of, and in front, of a nerve,  and a similar one on a lower molar thats almost, but not quite, to the nerve.  Not sure about the rest. Do I have to worry about it creating a direct path to the nerve if/when the fillings fail? Can oral hygiene effectively prevent or delay cavities under fillings? Should I actually consider having one or more functional fillings replaced with something sturdier like an inlay?I keep worrying I have a lot of root canals and extractions in my future and I that I can't prevent it at this point. honestdoc: The best thing you can do is to get regular checkups.  Only through x-rays can we see cavities or defects under fillings.  I always tell patients that it is best not to get cavities and many don't care until they get problems.  Many people don't see the dentist until it is too late (cavities gone into the root canal space).  Proper and effective oral hygiene can definitely prevent future cavities as is proper diet.  Many people drink too much sugary, acidic, and or creamy beverages (lattes).  I'm a firm believer in less drilling the better.  All too often I see dentists take out old fillings and putting new ones in.  I have 35 year old silver fillings in my mouth.  Replacing fillings unnecessarily can weaken the tooth and make the tooth more sensitive (traumatize the nerve in the root canal).  Worry what you can control.  Get regular checkups with x-rays, do good OH, eat proper diet, and stay healthy.   Medications can dry your mouth and can lead to teeth deterioration (saliva protects your teeth). jb220: Thanks for responding to me, and for doing it so quickly. I get checkups. I used to follow a Dr.'s orders to avoid xrays too strictly, but don't anymore. Can I ask if hygiene can slow or prevent the ones under fillings? I think my hygiene is pretty good these days. Brush in the mornings and before bed, use waterpik every time I eat anything at home, use floss and/or interdental brushes every night, and use fluoride rinse. I also try to only eat carbs during meals, and working now to minimize carbs in my diet in general. I guess my fear is that my teeth are already so damaged that when the fillings fail things will progress so quickly that they'll require a root canal and those RC's will eventually require extractions."

    "dialogue": "Fuseta: I went for a check up last week and it was a new dentist who had just taken over. He said that he had been looking at some old x rays which were taken at least a year ago, if not longer. From looking at those, he said that I needed a big filling on one side and a tooth removed from the other side, as he said that it was a ticking time bomb, so ideally it should be removed straight away. I reluctantly agreed to the filling, but told him that I didn't want the tooth removed, as it wasn't causing me any problems. As I recall, the x rays were taken because I had an infection in the region at the time, but some antibiotics cleared it up. The previous Dentist disn't say that I needed a filling or a tooth out when he looked at the x rays. I can't decide whether this new Dentist is ultra keen and getting me to spend money that I don't have to or whether the previous denist was too lax. Surely the new Dentist should take some up to date x rays, rather than act on old ones. I have an appointment for the filling this week and I don't know whether to cancel it. It is impossible to get a second opinion as Dentists are not taking on any new patients in the town where I live. My husband has recently been struck off because he didn't book a 6 monthly check up and now he can't get in with a new dentist. honestdoc: When a new dentist is proposing treatment that is more costly and invasive, definitely get different opinions.  I'm sorry your area do not have available dentists.  In the Pacific NW where I practice, we have too many dentists (very desirable living environment).

This Xray is pre treatment to my crown. The tooth needed a crown due to too many fillings with minimal contact. He didn't give me a follow up xray when I told him about pain. He numbed me a second time. He also filled a cavity under there before putting a temporary crown on. It is just ripping thro my face with nerve pain, when I take a breath in even. He told me it's usual and unusual so who knows what that means. I'm going to end up getting it pulled at this point, and of course they already took my 700$ Dr M: Good dayI think it is best to request a follow-up x-ray. Although some sensitivity is usually normal after a crown prep, it should not be excruciating pain. The pre-prep x-ray shows a filling that was very close to the nerve. My money would be on a possible root canal treatment on this tooth. Don't cement the permanent crown before this issue is resolved"

I get anxious just taking my kids for their check ups. But try and keep it in check for the sake of my kids, if they see I’m fearing their appointment it’s going to make them be fearful.My fear comes from my childhood when my dentist always knocked me out with the Gas when I needed an extraction, I used to fight it and always threw up when I came round.Closest I’ve got to regular check ups since have been visits to the emergency dentist.I’ve also neglected my teeth over the years, and have a few broken teeth that cause no pain, (broken down to the gum line broken). And recently fractured another tooth over the last few weeks which wasn’t causing any pain until a day or so ago, and started with a severe toothache, but eased slightly today.Because I have neglected my teeth. Along with my fear from my childhood, it’s making me more anxious/nervous/fearful of visiting a dentist.Probably just need some reassurance. That there’s nothing to fear. maybe a little telling off by the dentist. honestdoc: Modern dentistry has improved a lot.  It usually involves less trauma and more predictable results.

Mild pain which comes and goes.\nNow the most curious thing is I have had no pain at night and takes an hour or so in morning to start aching. I'd really appreciate\na explanation - I can't understand it.Seems to me, pain gradually starts as I use my jaws for eating and talking. Different molars may react on different days but it\nseems to be getting more regular.No reaction to hot and cold or pressure.\nTooth pain is not helped by Paracetemol or Ibuprofen.My dentist has done various checks but found nothing conclusive.  He did mention about possibility of small hidden cracks but xrays\nhaven't revealed them.\nI find it hard to believe that Ive had molars with the same problem, in a relatively short space of time. honestdoc: X-rays will not pick up cracks unless the crack has separation.  With heavily filled molars, the dentist needs to check on the pulpal health and tooth sleuth (bite stick) for cracks.  Depending on the findings, you may need root canals and crowns. Eros: Thanks for the comments doc.\nAny thoughts on why my sleep has not been effected? honestdoc: Your condition(s) seem more complicated.  You may have multiple factors such as TMJ, grinding, clenching, etc.  The dentist may need to eliminate different possible causes. Eros: My dentist referred me to an Endodontist specialist who did a very thorough check of several problem molars (UL, UR, LL and LR) including percussion, electric, tooth sleuth, cold test. Like my own dentist he didn't find anything of significance.He did a CT Scan of two molars and an extraction site which didn't reveal anything very significant. He didnt scan the other areas for the present – and gave me his reasons.\nHe doesnt think its cracking and no evidence of pulpitis. Said there was no suggestion of grinding or clenching.\nBasically, he is very reluctant to do root canal treatment in case he does it and finds that I still have pain. Then have to repeat.So I am basically still waiting to see how things pan out.I did wonder, though I havent asked the specialist, Ive had problems with Lower Left 7 and Lower Right 6 (was extracted but still pain issues) since start of year.\nThe problems with Upper Left 6 and Upper Right 7 started in March.\nAny possibility of referred pain between upper and lower jaw?"

You can get a roll of PH paper and just spit it on in the morning when you wake up. I was having terrible morning breath which was not usual for me.. I checked and the PH was 5.5 . I'm taking Coral Calcium liquid now and \"Miracle PHour\" , and my morning PH is up to about 6.5 and the bad taste and breath has improved.. but I have a small cavity or maybe two that I need to fix. If you have a hidden cavity that your dentist is not detecting, it would very surely cause bad taste and bad breath. In my experience it is possible for a dentist to miss a cavity, I'd try to go to another for a free exam if possible.  It's also possible dentist will tell you have a cavity when you don't though, this has happened to me many years ago, and I know others it happened to as well, so it's very though!\nI believe my diet caused low PH saliva which then ate away at my teeth and caused the cavities I've had.  Bacteria make acid that causes cavities. Saliva can neutralize that acid. Also I believe neutral PH saliva will not allow bacteria to proliferate like acidic saliva would.\nGive the PH paper a try if you can, I'm curious what you will find. otterslide: I'd also recommend trying Uncle Harry's Tooth Powder instead of regular tooth paste and see if that helps. It's very minty, and it's so strong that it takes the bad breath away for quite a while. It is very alkaline as well so it will neutralize acidic saliva for a period of time.

First-time poster here.I had three fillings done (3, 14, and 18) in one visit more than a week ago.I didn't eat solid food the day of the procedure because the local anesthesia in the lower left quadrant was so strong that my left chin/lower lip/left ear remained numb for 5 hours after the numbing shots.I had cereal as breakfast on Day 2. Ouch! I felt severe pain with each bite in 18. Furthermore, 18 and 14 both became sensitive, even when drinking water at room temperature. I called the dental office and was seen again by the dentist that afternoon. He said 18 seemed a bit tall so he ground it down a bit (his explanation was to reduce the pressure on 18, if I remember correctly), and said my nerves were probably agitated and I should give it two weeks for them to quiet down.I have been having a hard time eating ever since. Eating only soft food, I still feel pain in 18 and now 14 too with most bites. The pain may not be as sharp, but it's still quite painful. What's more, the whole lower left quadrant would feel sore/inflamed after each meal that lasts hours.I haven't had a chance to try 3 because one of my teeth in the lower right quadrant is missing and I don't use that side to chew.I have had many fillings done before (actually, both 14 and 18 had old fillings before this procedure) and I have never experienced discomfort/pain afterwards. That makes me wonder what could have gone wrong this time.Any insight on what may be causing the pain while chewing in those teeth with new fillings, and how should they be corrected? Thanks. honestdoc: Since you had fillings before, you may understand that any drilling on teeth can cause teeth to be sensitive.  The deeper the cavity, the more drilling is needed which can make the teeth even more sensitive especially to cold.  The best indicator will be if the sensitivity improves over time.  If not, get seen for any problems or need for possible root canal."

Thyroid problems can cause tooth issues, and radiation can affect thyroid tissue, but a calcified tooth, won't cause this. shawnmcc: My case is unique because I have had this baby tooth since I was 4 it was calcified so I think it spread out and in later few years spread to other areas of the body. My dentist some how missed it all these years for some reason. After it flew out of my mouth the new tooth was already erupted so at least that went fast. I forgot to add that it seemed to shed calcification off like plaque which it did at the root into the blood. It later did this effecting my appendix. Dr M: The calcifications you speak of, sounds like dental calculus. If you had excessive dental calculus, I think there is a possibility that you might have periodontal disease. Studies have showns that periodontal disease has links with heart and kidney disease, cancer, osteoporosis and in some rare cases appendicitis. Acute appendicitis is very rare though.\nIf you are indeed one of these cases, I think you need to see a periodontist, so that this can be evaluated and managed. shawnmcc: Thanks for the response I dont think I have periodontal disease because only one tooth was effected.

I was a little troubled, because my former dentist (who had gone out of network) was really thorough and I had plenty of major dental work over the years, but never anything that felt fishy or unnecessary. The biggest recommendation related to three of my back molars, placed next to each other, all had old silver fillings in them. The recommendation was to crown those teeth \"preventatively.\" I questioned doing all three at once because budget was a big issue for me and this was going to max out my insurance in only February and cost me about $2200 out of pocket on top. I had NO pain, sensitivity or issues whatsoever with these teeth. When asked if I had any concerns at my check up, the answer was no, I was good. The dentist told me that doing all three at once was recommended so the crowns would match. That felt off to me... I have other crowns and they match.... but I figured to avoid future problems I should just do it and be done with it as recommended. NO mention was made of any possibility of this prompting new serious issues. I asked several questions and made my budget concern VERY clear to the dentist. I asked about surprises too. They prepped the teeth, then put one large temporary crown on all three teeth. As soon as the numbing wore off, I was in pain. It kept getting worse and worse. I was on a LOT of otc pain meds. I call the dentist and go in. She did a \"bite adjustment\" and said if it still hurt in a few days to call an endodontist to \"see what was going on in there\". Sure enough the pain persisted and was excruciating. I go to the endodontist who over the course of 2 months root canaled all three molars through the temporary crown. He didn't want to do them all at once because pain can refer (and them all being under one crown didn't help) and he was hoping they would not all need a root canal. So he started with the one that was obviously the worst and we went from there. All this is going on and I am also in chronic discomfort because the temporary crown had a long edge that was sharp like a razor blade. It tore up my gum and tongue. Unfortunately, I could not go get the awful temporary off and get the permanent crowns installed until the pain was resolved. I spent more than 2 months in chronic pain. Finally, the day comes for my three permanent crowns to be installed. I had already paid in full for the entire crown treatments for these three teeth, plus extra charges for xrays when I returned in terrible pain. The crown install appointment happens. Most of the appointment was bite adjustment after the crowns were on. She did not do much to me other than clean up the teeth after the temporary came off. Nothing about any needed additional services or issues was stated. I leave, thinking my nightmare is finally over, but resentful that I went from no pain, to months of pain and out over $7000+ when I really could barely afford the original budget. Now, two weeks later, a bill arrives in the mail from this dentist for $1,350 for three \"core build up\" @ $450 per. I am, again, BLINDSIDED. They knew my insurance was maxed out when I was there, they sent me on my way without asking for money, the date of core build up services was the crown install date. Doesn't a crown build up happen before the crown (i.e., before that temporary crown was put on in February)? The endodontist had filled the holes, I remember him discussing it with me. Also, the root canals were MAJOR procedures and cost about $1400 each, so how is a treatment that, if done, took less than five minutes worth $450??? Is it okay for a dentist to do work without disclosing they are doing it or the charge that will be forthcoming? This dentist came recommended and I am just dumfounded. Everything about this has been troubling. I have already found a new dentist to move to, but I really am feeling duped and ripped off at this point. Any insights as to whether this sounds kosher would be appreciated? I really don't think it was okay for them to say nothing to me and bill me, but, that won't change my having to pay. I also am angry at myself for being duped into doing all three. If I'd just waited for those teeth to fail, it would have cost me the same and I'd have had to endure a few days of pain instead of months of it.

Also, the root canals were MAJOR procedures and cost about $1400 each, so how is a treatment that, if done, took less than five minutes worth $450??? Is it okay for a dentist to do work without disclosing they are doing it or the charge that will be forthcoming? This dentist came recommended and I am just dumfounded. Everything about this has been troubling. I have already found a new dentist to move to, but I really am feeling duped and ripped off at this point. Any insights as to whether this sounds kosher would be appreciated? I really don't think it was okay for them to say nothing to me and bill me, but, that won't change my having to pay. I also am angry at myself for being duped into doing all three. If I'd just waited for those teeth to fail, it would have cost me the same and I'd have had to endure a few days of pain instead of months of it.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Your whole ordeal screams “money grubbing dentist!” This is going on so much these days there should be investigations.

I had no cavities or anything. Then she shaved away at part of my old perfect filling which I don’t know why she touched because it was white and done perfectly fine, and then some of my natural tooth structure!

I’m not the same mentally or physically because I can’t eat, don’t want to eat and losing weight Then I have jaw pain, numbing in feet, neck pain, ear pain, skull pain, blurred vision and more. I think my incident gave me TMJD. When a bite is too high, too low, misshaped teeth and more causes this because your bite isn’t right.

    "dialogue": "Tony3619: Hello. My first post here so thank you in advance! I had a Maryland bridge fitted about 2 years ago to replace a front tooth. I have noticed that there is a minor silver line/scratch in a curved pattern which runs about half the length of the top surface of the tooth.My first thought was the tooth crown has cracked. The scratch is not visible from the underside and if running a nail over it there is no groove or fracture edge. It's still smooth.Do the wings of a Maryland bridge go through the entire structure of the fake tooth? My feeling is its either a surface scratch that can be polished out or the wing is detaching from the fake tooth ( not the real tooth) cause it to crack other time. Can white fillings be used to repair Maryland bridges? I am obviously going to book a dentist appointment to check but being in the UK our dentist service is about a 2 month wait! MattKW: Can you post a photo? The wings are usually metallic but can sometimes be made of ceramic. Either way, I have never seen a false tooth break off the supporting metal substructure. A Maryland bridge fails when the whole thing falls off - wing(s) and false tooth. Tony3619: Where I have circled in the photo you can see a faint line almost like a semi circle on the outer edge in the front incisor. It doesn't show behind and doesn't extend all the way to the edge of the tooth. Does the entire Maryland tooth have a metal structure and the tooth is built around it?"

    "dialogue": "Ellery: Hello everyone. I’m new here and had some questions.I hadn’t gone to a dentist in over 10 years since I’m very afraid. I also have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), pretty severe anxiety and suffer from panic attacks, and struggle with agoraphobia and don’t like to leave my house.Anyway, my tooth broke in October of 2021 and I let it go until I started to feel some pain around February. I still feel some pain but it’s not too much. I eventually did go to a consultation with a dentist at the end of March and did not like him. I went to a few others and have not found a dentist I like as no one seems compassionate or understanding to my concerns and worries but I have set an appointment with one for June 16th. I will be doing oral sedation which is my first time experiencing that and I’m kind of nervous about how it will go.The other thing I’m nervous about is that he says he will do a pulpotomy to help with the pain and then I have to eventually have a root canal if I want to save the tooth, which I do. However, I also really don’t want a crown though and I’m having trouble with the idea of that. I would like to do an onlay after the root canal which I’ve read is possible but everyone is just pushing the crown. I think it might be because of my OCD but the idea of a permanent change like losing my tooth forever and having a fake tooth put over it is incredibly upsetting to me. I feel like the onlay wouldn’t upset me as much because I’d still be able to see some of my tooth and it won’t have to be shaved down like it would for a crown.I was wondering if it really is possible to do the onlay after the root canal and also if anyone had any experience or thoughts about the pulpotomy. I have read they can last for a long time sometimes and wonder if I could just do the pulpotomy and leave it like that for years?If not, I’m just wondering if the pulpotomy would ruin the tooth structure at all and make it less likely I can have the onlay after. Would it be better to not do anything with the tooth and look around more for someone who could possibly do an onlay?I’m very nervous and would greatly appreciate any help as I really don’t know what to do.Thank you.P.S. I attached x-rays I just had done last month as well as photos of the broken tooth (sorry the quality isn’t the best). MattKW: After the Root Canal Therapy (RCT), nearly all teeth require either an onlay (more conservative) or a crown (less conservative). Your tooth has a large hole at the back (distal) that will require a crown; an onlay won't suffice. Oral sedation can be fine, but you need someone to come with you and drive you home - don't use public transport. The shortest-acting oral sedative is triazolam; just ideal for typical dental appts. A better choice may be nitrous oxide (inhalation, \"Laughing Gas\") because it is quickly reversible, and more easily adjusted during the appointment. With really nervous pts I would use triazolam PLUS nitrous.\nMy preferred use of triazolam is a dose the night before (get a good night's sleep), and then an early dental appt the next day. The triazolam should be given in the reception area about 45 mins beforehand so we can see if you have an adverse reaction (very rare paradoxical reaction with no harm) - I've only ever seen one in 40 years of practice.\nI look at your Xrays and see significant erosion of your lower teeth, that is seen in people who have many acidic drinks (usually sodas or fruit juices). Start drinking plain (non-sparkling) tap water or an RCT will be the least of your worries. Erosion is very difficult to treat beyond a certain point, which you are very close to achieving.\nLastly, if you get thru the RCT OK, talk to your dentist about removing upper and \"lower wisdom teeth\" on your right side. Hopefulgirl: Hi did you ever get an onlay done if so how do you like it? I wanted your opinion on the onlay in particular, thanks"

They also concluded that it needed a root canal. They completed the initial root canal treatment fine, however when I came back for the root canal filling 2 weeks ;ater, they had to abandon the session after 20 mins or so as they said it was bleeding and they were not sure why. So they said I come back in a week to try again?Can anyone give me an idea on why this may be the case? I am thinking whether I should go to endodontist instead, but I have already paid for the root canal treatment (which was successful until the filling had to go in?) Dr M: Good dayCould be residual pupal tissue that is still present in the canals or could be infection that still needs to clear up. Worst case scenario is that the tooth became perforated.\nI would go for the follow-up, so that the tooth can be re-assessed. Boro22: Thank you. They did take an x-ray and found no issue last week but I will go back for the reassessment. Do you think I would be better off going to endontist from here or just go see the dentist again? Dr M: It depends. A lot of dentists are experienced in molar root canal therapies, but if you are unsure, you can always go to an endodontist, but the costs might be more. Boro22: I went back today for the follow up/filling and they notice atill bleeding on one of the canals. They have referred me to a specialist. Any more clues from the x-ray?"

Occasionally get a dull throb for a few seconds but not sure if this is just part of the healing process as it's not terrible and quite brief.What I wanted to know was, will the gum fuse together? I had stitches which effectively closed the extraction site off, they have since dissolved and I now have a small line which isn't sealed from front to back of the extraction site. It's quite neat but the gap is around 1mm. Will this fuse together? It looks as though it's healed for the most part but I'm just concerned small bits of food get into it.Or will the extraction hole \"fill upwards\" if that makes sense?Thanks MattKW: Yes, it takes up to 3 months before the wound will \"fill up\" and become unnoticeable. If this had been a simple cut on your arm and the edges could be brought together, then there is faster healing. After a tooth extraction, there is a bony hole left behind, underneath the gum.

    "dialogue": "AGENT: Morning, I had awful toothache and attended  an emergency appointment with my Dentist on 28th June to find out I had infection in 2 teeth. They prescribed me 5 days of antibiotics which relieved the pain within 2 days (I did finish the 5 day course), but they could not give me an appointment for root canal until 13th July. Today I find myself in the same position feeling dreadful with awful toothache along with a high temperature,  dizziness and pain when swallowing. I called my dentist to see if they could give me another course of antibiotics to see me through to my next appointment and was told they would not do this without seeing me. My dentist is an hours drive away and as I say I feel dreadful and could not face a 2 hour round trip. So, called my GP who informed me that the symptoms I am experiencing are all symptomatic of a tooth infection and I would need to contact my dentist. Any advices to help me through the next 5 days would be much appreciated. Thank you Dr M: Good day\nOften with a dental abscess, the appropriate pain killers to use, is something that is anti-inflammatory. Contact your GP for a possible prescription. Or try over the counter anti-inflammatory medication. MattKW: You really need to see if you can get in sooner somewhere and have definitive treatment (extraction or start root canal). To simply give antibiotics without treating the cause is poor use of antibiotics and sometimes doesn't work (like you). That is akin to treating an infected splinter in your hand with antibiotics: the \"3Ds\" of dentistry are: Diagnosis, Definitive treatment, and only then Drugs."

    "dialogue": "Mel McC: Hi. I have just had my top implant bridge removed as I was in pain due to failing implants.  I am now so scared of more failures and pain I aha e decided to opt for a full removable denture .  Looking for comfort and reassurance on this mammoth decision MattKW: Dentures have been around  from around 7th century BC, when Etruscans fashioned dentures from animal and human teeth. Modern dentures are made from a type of plastic (Methyl methacrylate) since the early 1930s. I have sometimes been very surprised how well people adapt to plastic dentures, but it will take some time and patience. Geparddent: I agree with MattKW, dentures are actually nothing new. According to The History of Dentistry, dentures date even all the way back to 2500 B.C. when they were made from animal teeth. Centuries later, the ancient Egyptians and the Etruscans as MattKW mentioned made dentures from bone, wire, and repurposed animal and human teeth. YSI: Mel McC said:\t\t\tHi. I have just had my top implant bridge removed as I was in pain due to failing implants.  I am now so scared of more failures and pain I aha e decided to opt for a full removable denture .  Looking for comfort and reassurance on this mammoth decision\n\t\t\nClick to expand...I am curious also-I assume they create a custom mold to make a custom denture? Does the denture weigh the same as the sum of the missing teeth? As long as the plastic is as hard as bone it should weigh less than natural teeth??Is there any 'suction' helping it stay on, or is it all down to the cement/glue? Those devices in the kitchen that attach to a plastic freezer baggie and suck all the air out before freezing-maybe there could be a port in the denture to create suction to hold the teeth on?Could they surgically tether dentures to bone somehow instead of drilling into the bone as they did for implants? Do you have to wait for a period of time for gum swelling to subside before proceeding to molding? Do they trim the gum tissue before molding/creating the denture?  What do they call the u-shaped hard rim that our teeth are attached to? I have noticed for years Joe Biden's teeth slipping during speeches-you can't tell he has dentures until he starts speaking. MattKW: Yes, all dentures require a mould of your mouth. Modern dentures are quite light, but older ones (\"Vulcanite\") early 20th century were heavier. I have also seen some metal ones made in POW camps by inmates made in metal. \nModern dentures rely upon a good seal all around the edges to make a suction seal. If this is not possible (poor bone depth) then people may use denture adhesives to help. Dentures with suction cups were tried once, but they would create damage to the palate and are no longer made.\nIf you tether dentures to the bone, you still need to be able to remove them for cleaning. It would be otherwise like never taking off your shoes! Conventional implants can be used as a supplement for removable full dentures with O-ring type attachments (full coverage) or fixed (partial coverage, able to clean underneath). Sometimes mini-implants are used for removable dentures - easier to place, but mostly used while waiting for conventional implants.\nIdeally you wait 3 months after extractions for the bone to heal and reshape (remodel). \"Immediate\" dentures can be made to replace your extracted teeth on the day of extracting, but will cost more and require more adjustment visits. Sometimes any bumpy bone is removed to make the fit easier. The bone is the alveolar ridge."

It is very painful when I chew, even gently (I chew on the other side and have been for some time as it has been like this for the last 7 weeks). The extracted tooth hadn't felt right since it was crowned/root filled 2 years ago, but it now seems that it was not the one causing the jaw pain. It was removed by an emergency dentist as I don't have a dentist so no time was taken to really understand what might be the underlying issue. The only other tooth left on the right bottom row now is a wisdom tooth. It seems a healthy tooth, no pain at all when I press, push, or tap on it. Could this tooth still be the cause of the jaw pain even though there are no other signs? Dr M: Do you perhaps have any pre- or post x-rays you can share? SimonSays: Unfortunately I don’t anymore. I did have a digital copy of the original X-ray and could see the wisdom tooth in the X-ray, as did 2 other dentists.

    "dialogue": "juan.h: Hello everyone,\nFirst let me start with my story : I am 35 years old and 6 years ago I lost my 4 font upper teeth because of an accident. The dentist at that time made a bridge based on the 2 canines but now the bridge is not stable enough and my new dentist told me that I have to do RCT for the 2 canines and make crowns for them, and for the missing teeth she proposed to do another new implants-supported bridge or a denture. Honestly after many lectures and a lot of research I found that implants are not 100% successful and can have some complications plus they are quite expensive (here in Germany one implant cost around 2500 Euros). So I decided to go for upper partial denture and my dentist proposed \"Clearsplint\" denture. So I need your opinion about the following :- Can the denture hold for years ? (of course with proper care like professional cleaning twice a year)\n- What are the risks of wearing upper partial dentures for the front teeth ? is it true that is can increase the risk of oral cancer because of friction or any other reason ?\n- Also the same for RTC , is it safe ? Some people says it could burn out the immune system and rise the risk of cancer ?\n- Any of you is wearing partial denture at young age or know someone?Sorry if i ask many questions, but sometimes i cannot sleep because of thinking about the above and feel that my life is ruined and has no sense , it is really painful especially when it affects your family.\nI will appreciate any help"

    "dialogue": "Anxiousdentalpatient: I went to the dentist back in April, had a filling worked on. About a week ago, I started noticing temperature sensitivity so I went to the dentist just on Friday. He found that the filling was too high so he filed it down. Said it was hitting the other tooth causing inflammation.Now, two days later and that tooth is very very sensitive. I can’t even drink room temperature water and swish it around without feeling it. Is this normal after a filing of a tooth? Could he have filed it too much? I’m debating on if I should wait it out or call in the morning. Tooth otherwise does not hurt. I bought sensodyne on Friday before I went to the dentist. I also have extreme dental anxiety , but not to the point I avoid it, although I do hate going to the dentist.  I obsess if anything is wrong and worry until it is fixed. MattKW: Every time we drill into a tooth, some damage is done (that's why you need anaesthetic). And the deeper the decay, then the more likely the \"nerve\" may not recover.\nIf it was a composite (white) filling, then the filling is bonded onto the tooth structure. There are a number of reasons why this bonding may not be perfect, and that can often lead to prolonged post-op sensitivity. It is hardly ever due to a high filling - that would cause tenderness, not sensitivity.\nIt's hard to say what to do without knowing what was done. However, you can certainly try the Sensodyne for a few days - it won't do any harm. My next suggestion would be to redo the filling. Also, you could consider changing the filling to an amalgam - they have much lesser risk of post-op sensitivity. Anxiousdentalpatient: Thank you so much for this detailed response. I am going in tomorrow to see what is going on. It seems odd that it got more sensitive after he filed the tooth down a little bit."

This virus, once you get infected, remains dormant, often in the trigeminal nerve ganglion, and then gets \"re-activated\" under certain conditions, such as stress or a decrease in your immune system.\nThe virus then travels down the nerve fibres, of which the trigeminal nerve has certain branches associated with the ear region.

However, it was not only until the next day when a friend of mine had a similar case when he took a freshly baked spinach pie and while having agreed to take a beer afterwards. At one moment he said - \"this hot pie and a cold beer immediately afterwards, very bad for the teeth\" - which concerned me internally and from that moment I (sub)consciously(?) thought-provoked a discomfort in my mouth, particularly one dead tooth, minor/mild sensitivity which sometimes tends to jump on the other side of the mouth?It's been a week and I still do feel some kind of unusualness as before.p.s.

Managed to remove one root and half the tooth, but a large bit of the tooth remains below the gum line and of course the 2nd root.I had some pain and awful taste smell, so returned on the following Monday the dentist cleaned it up and packed it with a \"dressing\" which tasted of cloves. They advised me it was probably dry socket.I've had serious pain in my jaw probably due to the trauma over 2 hours, however I have some questions if anybody is able to offer some insight.1. I have a burning/scratchy sensation on the inside of my gum - almost under my tongue, could this be a \"burning\" of the dressing that was used, if it spilled over? I can't see any scratches/ulcers but it looks red (ish).\n2. The socket itself, the dressing appears to be beginning to fall out (at the rear side where the root remains), should this be TAKEN out or is it okay to sit until it naturally fall outs?\n3. When the dressing is completely out - how does this heal? If it's an empty socket, with no clot, can the hole ever close up? it's quite deep!?I'm booked in for surgery in 3 weeks for the remaining root to be removed. I fly long haul 2 weeks after and i'm just hoping to be comfortable when I go. I considered cancelling the surgery, but felt it may be better to just have it removed in case it flares up on a plane or while i'm supposed to be on a holiday.Any thoughts/comments would be welcome Dr Udeshna Singha: Hi this is Dr Udeshna Singha, consulting dental surgeon from Guwahati, Assam, India. Answer to 1. The \"dressing\" that was used was most probably zinc oxide eugenol paste since you said it tastes like cloves. Sometimes a combination of \"iodoform- antiseptic agent\", \"butylparaaminobenzoate- has an anesthetic action\" and zinc oxide eugenol is used. I don't really think any irritation might be caused by the dressing because zinc oxide eugenol has anti-inflammatory and local anaesthetic effects. \nAnswer to 2. Wait until it naturally falls outAnswer to 3. Socket healing will take place naturally. But sometimes the speed of healing is compromised due to habits like smoking or tobacco intake. So you should avoid that.  Healing of an extraction socket happens in 3 stages. It will take around 14 days. So do not worry. You will be fine. tomm88: Dr Udeshna Singha said:\t\t\tHi this is Dr Udeshna Singha, consulting dental surgeon from Guwahati, Assam, India.Answer to 1.

    "dialogue": "tber2022: I had a tooth removed a month ago and now I have some kind of growth where my tooth was. It also feels like my bone is coming out of my gums. You can see the white spot below the growth. I'm not sure if it's an abscess or what. My regular doctor put my on antibiotics and I'm going to see my dentist this week. Just wondering what all of your thoughts are. Very little pain and no fever.Thanks Dr M: Good dayThis might just be normal hypertrophy or growth of tissues after surgical trauma. A lot of times this gradually decreases in size over time. \nThe yellow, if hard,  might be a bony fragment being extruded. Between the roots of a tooth, you get inter-radicular bone. When the tooth is extruded, this bone is broken down as healing progresses. A lot of time it is just resorbed, but in certain cases, pieces of bone might be extruded over a period of weeks or months.\nIf this piece is irritating,it can be removed."

    "title": "Mandibular Nerve",
    "dialogue": "suneela: Over the last 2 ½ years I have been suffering with Left sided facial pain after a dental procedure. The problem started after a filling in my left molar with a local anaesthesia followed by electric sensations/ severe shooting pains across my lower left jaw, teeth, tongue and lip area. I was unable to eat or brush my teeth. The following six weeks, the dentist recleaned & re-filled the Left two molar teeth several times, at times I was jumping off the dental chair due to severe shocking painful currents, as if my whole being was hoovered by the dental suction tube. I asked for a referral to Dental Hospital but was assured that the other dentists would be doing the same. (He was an ‘award winning’ dentist, and I put my entire trust). He then performed root canal treatment on the same molar (I was undergoing IV Alendronic acid infusion and concerned about jaw necrosis). Four weeks later the root-canaled tooth was extracted, the dentist promising me that this would end my misery. With each procedure the pain was getting more unbearable. These 6 weeks, I had multiple injections sometimes even 7 local anaesthesia in one sitting for numbing.I’m currently under the care of an Oral Health/Facial pain consultant who referred me for MRI scans, and I’ve been seen by a neurologist in 2021, ruled out trigeminal neuralgia and advised it’s Mandibular nerve injury due to dental procedures and that a surgery will not give relief.I am on Pregablin and Oxcarbazapine three times daily. (Initially on Carbamazapine with several side effects)I continue to suffer from severe nerve pain – every single day, several times – any time I eat.First thing in the morning, the left side of the tongue feels tied at the back giving needle like /broken glass sensations with slight jaw/mouth/tongue movement (although I take the tablets just before bedtime and yet 4-5 hours later even a sip of water is agony lasting few minutes). Brushing my teeth triggers shooting nerve pain. Eating is a bit peculiar as initially it is extremely painful to eat, gradually easing out although not completely as the shocking pain strikes anytime.I was wondering if anyone in this forum has experienced this?Any professional suggestions for finding relief.Will this pain ever go away?Can the mandibular nerve heal by itself?Any other therapies that may help? nikassam: In my case a Psychologist and a neurologist handled me and I am fine now after 2 years of treatment . Dont know my nerve was damaged or not but i had same issue .Hope this info could help you suneela: Thank you. It's so comforting to get a response. And thank goodness your suffering has ended. A nerve pain in the mouth is so very debilitating. Only the person experiencing this can ever understand it. I was seen by a neurosurgeon who discharged me after looking at my MRI scan.  He was pretty confident that it is 'mandibular nerve' damage due to dental procedure.\nCurrently I can't imagine my life without the daily 'epilepsy drugs'. The next move maybe laser treatment but I've not as yet been referred. Even if I do get referred there'll be a long waiting list. \nI will consider looking into what's helped you. honestdoc: I'm sorry you are suffering from nerve pain.  I've been practicing for 24 years and I do get people experiencing electric shock during local anesthesia administration.  Just a few days ago, a young patient experienced his right vision blurriness temporarily for 10 minutes. Nerves have potential to heal and I'm sorry your nerves have been slow to respond.

I also feel that if my condition had been diagnosed earlier (by onward referral) I could have had the benefit of instant treatment. nikroute: I asked my neurologist . He said Nature of damage and symtoms needs to be accessed first to neuro treatment . nikroute: Hello , go to a experienced neurologist ( surgeon ) . Last step is surgery but as my neuro surgeon who treated me said after taking all history , nature of damage and symtoms , they can order MRI and some other scans ,test than only it will be decided whether surgery can cure it or not ."

It was a bad ordeal and was bleeding a lot, I went to the emergency dentist the day after and they x rayed it and said all 3 roots are still in and quite large so needs referring. Also the reason for extraction was because they said it was infected yet they left the roots in and never said anything to me after. I could of gotten referred by the emergency dentist but that would of costs more so I showed my dentist the x ray and said i need to be referred. They referred me nearly 4 weeks ago and still not heard anything. When I phoned them they tell me there is a waiting list and it will be the hospital that contact me first and it’s only mouth cancer that is an emergency so can be waiting a while. Is this normal to wait this long for a root referral after an extraction? Dr M: Good day\nThe waiting lists are dependent on the hospital. It is common for more serious conditions to be prioritized. Your condition can be managed in the mean time by medication. The lists are also dependent on the amount of oral surgeons available. You can consider going to a private oral surgeon, but there might be some additional costs involved."

Dr M: I would refer you to an oral surgeon for the extraction of the root. They are qualified to handle most complications associated with such an extraction.\nI can't see any other teeth that need root canal treatments, but as previously mentioned, I would need other type of x-rays in order to give definitive opinions Anna1910: Sorry for asking to much, but what about right front incisor?

    "title": "Cheap, Stingy, or ADHD?",
    "dialogue": "YSI: I am retired, long history of dental work. Filling in every tooth by end of high school. Root canal and crown after college. Today I have 5 crowns. The crowns have been great, although I opted for porcelain on the last one and don't love it-its size is smaller that corresponding teeth, and its color is nowhere close to my real teeth, causing people's eyes to track down to it when I smile.  So recently I was experiencing pain in 3 natural teeth. I called for an appt last September, was told 1st opening was in March. I whined (pain in 3 teeth) and the scheduler said let me check again and then said oh wait yes she has an opening... (end of November.) I arrive and I am seen by a young woman, but not by who I requested and who I was told the appt was with... The appt was pleasant but waste of time and money. I then was scheduled for February with who I had requested. Appt was pleasant and fillings done on right side. Discussion about crowns, root canals, and pulling teeth. Scheduled for end of April for left side which was the worst side... Fillings done, and again a discussion about crowns and root canals and pulling. My right upper work resulted in my right lower crown popping loose momentarily resulting in electrical lightning arcing from the gold crown forward thru the next two filled teeth. This has happened twice now, and saliva (?salt?) seems to trigger the lightning? The tooth above was shaped like a dagger striking the junction between lower tooth and crown. It had a pointy edge like a dagger. Complained at next appt and the sharp point was filed off but it still feels prominent. Left upper middle tooth, inbetween two crowns, is now also shaped like a dagger. But I finally figured out why this was occurring. Her fillings on the two dagger teeth do not fill to the top of the tooth-I have a gulley running down the length of those teeth. When I bite down on food these upper teeth don't have a flat stiking surface and the food is acting like a wedge giving me the feeling like my tooth is going to break apart, so I immediately back off of the chew (simply bread triggers this the most.) The right worst symptoms have mostly subsided. The left is getting worse-I now have pain above the tooth including the fleshy area left of my nose and above the bone my left upper teeth are adjoined to.  I remember excruciating pain before my root canal in my 20's, and this isn't close to that, yet, but very concerning-even flossing triggers pain along the rim of the dagger tooth so somehow I don't think filing this one down will do the trick. But currently it only hurts to touch/pressure. I have repeatedly told her I like crowns and don't care what my teeth look like and pulling is fine with me also. What do I have to say to get her to pull the trigger?!  I drive 2hrs for these appts and with inflation rising gas is expensive. How do you be forceful when you know that will trigger their temper?"

Although I realize the broken tooth may be prone to further cracks and may not last long, I would like to keep it for now because it satisfies\nmy 3 tooth-keeping criteria: it's still anchored to my bone, it's not loose and it doesn't hurt. (He says it can't be restored.)\n          If it's left in place and a 2-tooth flipper is used to plug the laterals, can a third tooth be added later in the event the cracked tooth absolutely needs to be extracted?

First step is to take immaculate care of the teeth. That is all i do to empower myself. I floss 3 -4 x a day, rinse with hydrogen peroxide very mild solution, morning and evening. I gargle with salt water when i have a tooth that is not right (as is the case currently). I rinse with water after each time im eating sweet or drink coffee, never let food or sugary liquids sit on your teeth. \nThere are things ofcourse that are out of our control, such as poor dentistry, money over actual dentistry ethics. For me a combination of bad experiences, and early braces that moved my teeth around at an early age causing very short roots. So all i can do is take care of what i have. I lost my lower left first molar due to a failed root canal and pain x 4 months which led me to have it extracted. Now im looking at the other first molar #30 which was a poor build up and botch patch up over the years that now is on its way out. Dont give up hope. Empower yourself with good hygiene, and a plan to make your mouth healthier, and happier. I'm with you. honestdoc: Find a dentist your family, friends, acquaintances had good experience with and get an exam.  Hopefully he/she will go over treatment options best suited for you."

    "dialogue": "superillusion: Hello, I grind and clench my teeth sometimes at night, I do wear an OTC mouthguard nightly but was without it one night last Sunday. I woke up last Monday with a sore jaw (hinge) and headache that persisted throughout the day and have delt with this before. By Wednesday night I was in  great deal of pain, my jaw hinge was almost completely better but the underside of my jaw was hurting now and almost felt like nerve pain, the pain seemed to be coming from a root canaled tooth but the adjacent and teeth above were also sore and maybe a little swollen because my bite felt slightly off.I went to the dentist the following afternoon and they didn't see any chips or cracks upon exam or x-ray, and I have no sensitivity to hot or cold. I was fitted for a proper nightguard and the dentist did shave down my one of my teeth after after doing the paper test, but I had no problems with my bite prior to this incident. The initial swelling has come down but now my bite is super off due to the drilling. The dentist said the pain was fro. Grinding and should subside but I haven't slept in three days and have made a conscious effort to keep my teeth from touching so as not to further aggravate the initial issue. The pain has not gotten any better, only gotten worse and 800mg every 6 hours of Ibuprofen is not helping. I have another appointment this afternoon. The pain doesn't seem to really be in my teeth anymore but more so but the area directly below the teeth on the whole bottom right side, like in the area where you would give an injection to numb. What could this possibly be? Could I have a sprained tooth, or maybe even a fracture in my jawbone? I guess I looking for the right language or ideas to help my dentist pinpoint the issue.

I finally agreed, and now I have a very noticeable filling in my front tooth. It doesn't blend in well at all.

Basically, every once in a while my jaw will kind of seize up. When this happens, my jaw is slightly pushed forward/back (I can’t think which way until it’s actually happening)  and I will have to just force open my mouth for a few seconds then it immediately goes back to normal. I feel sudden panic as when it does happen, I can feel my top and bottom teeth being pushed together at extreme force due to them being misaligned with my jaw being in a different position, and the extreme pressure/friction feels like my teeth will just pop out. Any googling just comes up with lockjaw, but from what I’ve found that seems something more long lasting, as what happens with can be sorted in the few seconds. I have TMJ due to clenching mainly, and sometimes teeth grinding. Any insight would be amazing, thank you!"

    "dialogue": "Eros: I had a lower right molar extracted 8 weeks ago. Which left me requiring root removal by a specialist. Whilst waiting for the root removal I was in steady, but bearable pain for 7 weeks from the extraction site. These roots were surgically removed 8 days ago. I am in quite a lot of pain and have been told it could take a couple of weeks to settle. So am using pain killers.In the days following the original extraction, I was aware of a top left molar starting to give occasional twinges. Then a few weeks later my top right molar (above the extraction site) started to do the same. Both molars have fillings. Some weeks on I'm still getting more regular nips of light pain and am concerned in case it worsens. Doesn't effect sleeping and don't seem to respond to pain killers.I've seen two dentists (different practices) who have both looked at separate xrays and visual checks and both say there is no obvious problem.  I shouldn't doubt two dentists stating the same thing but am still concerned it could be something they have missed . As might be obvious I have allowed myself to become stressed out about it.  Any thoughts or advice appreciated. MattKW: Hard to say without access to your records and Xrays. however, given that the lower right wound is still uncomfortable, then it may be that the pain is being referred to the upper right area. It might also be supposed that due to the right side healing, you are eating more on the left side than usual, so maybe that explains the upper left. All this is guesswork and a bit of experience. The fact that 2 different dentists have found nothing wrong is encouraging. Eros: Thanks for your comments Matt."

    "dialogue": "Adele_Hedley: We all know the conspiracy behind the NHS not admitting the truth as to why people are now having to be placed on a waiting list that could take as long as a year to receive dental treatmentThrough suffering ill health and a mental illness my teeth have really suffered. Every tooth is now loose, I obviously have some sort of severe gum disease. By the time i move up the waiting list to be seen (18 months) I doubt I will still have any teeth left.\nI am being seen tomorrow by a dentist due to a rotten tooth that is causing me to have regular abscesses. My gums move easily where the pocket keeps filling up with puss.The dentist will only treat this one tooth, is it just me........thinking how on earth could a dentist  witness such bad gum disease with every tooth hanging on by a thread allow me to wait a further 18 months to be treated on the NHS. \nWhen I booked the appointment I was given a choice of four appointments that were empty. I believe all UK dentists are giving preferential treatment to all private patients. Why can't I be seen next week knowing there are appointments available or allow those on the waiting list to get seen quicker.\nI feel it's no different in a Doctor treating an open bleeding wound on my arm that is broken. No doctor will send someone home without treating my fractured arm or put them on an 18 month waiting list Surely it's the same principle. I just can't get my head around why the NHS are no longer performing preventative treatments, my teeth could of been saved but now I face pulling them out myself the looser they get. The NHS have proven they have no duty of care towards us NHS patients. Does anyone know the truth behind it all.\nI require intensive cleaning, treatments costing huge amounts of money. I have no choice but to allow my teeth to fall out. At 47 all my feminity will be lost. I will look awful being all gummy\nAdele MattKW: I've seen private and public dentistry in Australia. An \"open bleeding, broken arm\" might compare to a jaw fracture in dentistry where treatment would be prioritised. Unfortunately, cavities and gum disease are probably more akin to worn out hips and knee joints; the urgency is not high (you're not about to die). Governments are usually counting the pennies, looking for cost efficiencies. They also want to treat the greatest number of people in the shortest possible time to keep waiting lists low. So, they don't offer intensive, lengthy, and high cost treatments to public patients. It's far from a perfect world and I wonder sometimes why so much money is spent on high-tech expensive medical equipment and procedures rather than better dentistry. nikassam: Its because of mis managment of health system . I got 11 times treated in india and my experience in indian medical system isYou visit the OPD , register your name , address and specify your issue , they will ref you to concerned doctor , clinical examination done and on basis of case severity ( extraction usually requires 3 days antibiotics prior to extraction ) all doneNo need of waiting .Even you can directly talk to super speciality doctor like i dont want to talk with dentist so i said can i talk to MAXILOFACIAL SURGEON they said yes you canThats how other countries should device their medical managmentEven indian medical system has ORS system fill the online appointment , choose your date , time and medical name , DONE\t\t\t\t\t\tORS Patient Portalors.gov.in\n\t\t\t\t\nAnd ine superb experience of my life is i had a complaint of left side headache since 2014 in my home country. Doctors suggested finally for some kind of tablets and to reduce my stress . But when as of my work shifted to india and while visiting AIIMS doctor immediatlt said Sir your headache is caused by your wisdom teeth mesio buccal root is inside your sinus .

My bite feels off, one sides uppers and lowers meet but the other side doesn't. But each side switches throughout the day.

    "dialogue": "Mobley: Any help is appreciated ,So I bit into another fork within an 8 month period. This time I actually chipped one of my lower teeth however my dentist said that it was a minor chip and didn't need any treatment. He did a sensitivity test on my teeth (by spraying something cold onto a q-tip and touching the affected teeth with it). All of the teeth had a reaction except one of my top front teeth (I couldnt feel anything at all of the cold substance he sprayed). He suspects he'll need to do a root canal for it but that I should wait a few weeks (2-3) to see if it'll get better in that time since the tooth was recently traumatized (like 3 days ago). He emphasized that if the tooth is to change colour or pain increased I should go back to see him. I have issues with bruxism as well so I know my teeth are really stressed. Yesterday the pain was intense (however I think that because he aggravated it), while this morning it was much more relaxed. Me being very anxious about this stuff I've been examining it all morning and I think I may have aggravated it and the pain is back. This morning the pain was non existent, but now it's back a little less intense than yesterday but there none the less. I've been really careful not to use the tooth (while eating or not letting anything touch it while drinking). My question is I've been really trying not to grind my teeth and I've been doing salt water rinses and burshing and flossing twice a day, is there any way I can prevent a root canal? My teeth are generally not in the best shape as I didn't really put in the effort to take care of them in the past, but I've been working diligently this past year to fix up any of the issues I've had (I've been going to dentists and even some specialists, I have a cleaning every 3 months or so to keep them in good shape). I really want to prevent doing a root canal for any of my teeth for the longest possible (and especially for my front ones since I really value my smile and I'm worried it'll affect it). Sorry for the long post but I'm just looking if there's anything I can do in the next few weeks to help the nerve recover at all?"

I had no sensitivity to cold or hot with the old filling.Things were fine with no sensitivity whatsoever after replacing the old Class I in November and getting the Class V for abfraction.However, in recent weeks (4 months later), I’ve started to notice sensitivity to cold on the occlusal surface of said tooth right on the filling. It’s a sudden burst and disappears after a second or two. It’s especially evident when chewing salad or drinking cold water. I don’t seem to notice any sensitivity around the gum line and there’s no cold sensitivity in surrounding teeth. X-rays don’t show anything out of the ordinary with the tooth. There are no noticeable stains on the filling edges after examining the occlusal surface.I brush gently and use sensitivity toothpaste. I have been eating an apple a day and I figure I will ease up on this just to see if acidity is an issue.I’m posting here if any dentists could share any experiences of treating patients with similar cases or if there are any ideas on what the source is.

    "title": "Agonising pain when biting with tooth which has lost a filling",
    "dialogue": "borontrichloride: Greetings,I seek any advice and thank you in advance.Last year during the summer I lost a filling - I assume it is because I chewed gum everyday because I rarely eat sugary food and/or hard/chewy food. Anyway I have stopped chewing gum. I haven't had it treated because here in the UK the waiting list is a long time for NHS dentist registration and when I went to a private dentist they gave me a laundry list of \"recommended treatments\" which was just shy of £1000 which I can't afford.Ever since this initially happened my bite has been affected - any time I bite on that side of my mouth (filling came out of left side, upper, back tooth) whereby if I bite any food during chewing, the tooth in question has a feeling of being jammed further into my gum and I get a very intense, agonising and sharp pain, (maybe the nerves?). I find it perplexing that the loss of a filling can alter the direction/angle of bite to the point where this can happen.Additional context - I have no pain if I bite down with an empty mouth, even if I bite hard as a test. It is only when some food is in between the upper and lower jaw on the side of the filling loss and then I bite, the feeling is that of the food mass pushing against the filling loss tooth and jamming that tooth further into my gums, agonisingly painfully.It doesn't hurt when I touch it or even when brushing my teeth. I get only minor/dull pain also when drinking hot/cold drinks or eating hot/cold food.Any advice is of course appreciated. Thanks so much for your time. Dr M: Good day\nAny lost filling, if left untreated for too long, has a chance of becoming carious and will then eventually lead to either root canal treatment or tooth loss. The pain you are experiencing might be due to exposed dentine only, however it is impossible to say without a clinical examination or x-rays. \nMy advice would be to get the lost filling replaced as soon as possible."

    "dialogue": "girlblushes: Hello everyone! I'm new here so I hope my post is ok, and not something already covered extensively! I'm wondering about my 7 yr old sons adult teeth. My son plays rough & unfortunately he injured his 2 front teeth& the dentist said we needed to pull them (I think to not negatively affect his adult teeth? Can't remember for sure) - he was only 3 at the time! The dentist told us his adult teeth look fine and they can already see them, theyll be coming in. Well that was years ago, now he's 7 (8 in October!) and STILL NO SIGN OF the 2 front teeth! (On top)...i think of cute 5 year olds in kindergarten singing \"all I want for Christmas is my 2 front teeth!\"... At 7 though?! That doesn't seem right to me and I'm increasingly worried. He's already given up hope that he will ever have anything there by now, it's so sad. With how many years going without them, I'm now worried about how it could negatively affect speech (his words tend to sound babyish), tongue position, tooth placement etc! Is this abnormal for his age, should I be worried?! Please let me know, thank you in advance!! Dr M: Good dayI think it would be best to be a little more patient. The normal eruption age of your front incisors is between 7 and 8. If you are really worried, you can go take an x-ray at the dentist, to confirm the presence of the central incisors as well as how far they are from erupting.\nSpeech should not be affected that much at this stage.\nWith the loss of any baby tooth prior to its normal eruption time, there is a chance that the permanent incisors can come out rotated or slightly malpositioned. Orthodontic evaluation can then take place around 11, to determine if ortho is required. shawnmcc: I started to erupt my first adult teeth at 40 years old. The first one was my center front tooth. I dont know what my dentist did to keep my baby teeth there or maybe they are implants but I am not sure maybe little both. So its possible he wont erupt them till late in age. Plus I think I have a thyroid problem that might have caused it. So you can get him checked out just in case if you want."

I went to the dentist to make sure and he said there was a cavity in between the teeth and put a deep filler in it. He said I should try the filler and if it hurts, I need a root canal. I tried not to chew from that side since it was a little sensitive, but if I accidentally did, it was fine. Then I decided to try biting (cereal bran) directly on it after a week to test it out since I have a dental appointment the next day. I had a jolting pain that lasted a few seconds, the pain lingered a little bit but went a way. I was concerned because I never felt that kind of pain before after fillers. So I told my dentist and he performed a root canal on it. I didn't know the disadvantages of root canal (stupid I know) and I didn't want to make it worse so I just went with it. Learning more about it, I was wondering if it was really necessary since I didn't feel pain all the time. I asked my dentist again and he said I had no other option since the cavity was deep. I want to make sure I did the right thing to follow his advice. I don't have the x-rays unfortunately. Thank you!\nPs: I've been with this dentist for a year since moving to Japan."

However, my wife and I have lived at our current home for just over a couple of years now and  I don't know if things have changed or it's peculiar to the area. It seems now that there is a lot of emphasis on collecting the money up front which includes some charges that might not be needed. It happened again yesterday with a new dentist who was replacing a porcelain on metal crown. It included the full cost of the crown and a core buildup despite the fact that the dentist had commented that he couldn't see what was under the crown due to it being metal. Is that the new normal?That raises the second question about the need for a core buildup. How do they know that will need that until they look? It seems that is now routinely added whenever a crown is being done whether it's new or a replacement. More and more often these days going to a dentist feels like going to your auto mechanic which leads to the issue of how to find a competent and honest dentist but I'll save that for now."

    "dialogue": "David S.: Back in July I began a series of dental visits for a broken tooth and lost filling that happened during the COVID shut down when offices were closed. Due to the back up appointment times were lengthy. My dentist suggested having several teeth pulled and a bridge put in. In Sept. when I went to see the oral surgeon I found that my original dentist had left the practice and a new dentist changed my course of treatment. He wanted to try and save a few teeth and the number of extractions was cut.  After the extractions I was given a temporary bridge. I was then seen in Oct. for several root canals and crown prep. In early Nov. I was in for a final impression. At that time I informed them I was moving out of state and time was of essence. He assured me it was no problem and I was set in early Dec. for my bridge work to be completed. A week before my appointment I received a call stating the lab needed a new impression. I explained to them my situation and the lab agreed to try and use what they had and rush my work. I move next week and they have still not received my bridge. All of this work was paid in advance per their policy. They refuse to entertain a refund and tell me I will have to return when they receive the bridge which is not possible. I will be 12 hours away and my family only has one vehicle. I do not have the resources to fly and rent a car. Do I have any recourse open to me? Can you sue a dentist for failure to complete their work.? Thanks for any assistance! honestdoc: I also have lab support difficulties.  I usually don't like to cut it close with rush jobs.  Communication is the key.  If you were my patient and told me when you will be leaving, I will usually have you see your next dentist instead of rushing it.  A rush job on a bridge can be disastrous such as poor esthetics, poor margins where contaminants can leak, poor bite, poor contouring, pain, sensitivity, pulpal damage, bone damage, and poor gum health."

It’s started off with red patches with white lining the patches, which I’ve summed up to be geographic tongue but now I’m not too sure.I stopped smoking the devils lettuce which I used to mix with tobacco about 2 months ago and recently had an iron infusion hoping that the patches would go away. I’ve found that geographic tongue is meant to be migratory but on my tongue, it seems to just appear on the one side, heal, and just before it’s done healing more small patches appear on the same spot that grow into bigger patches. The whole process repeats itself.In the past 2 weeks the side of my tongue has been a little bit sore, not painful but just uncomfortable especially if it accidentally graze it with teeth.I’ve got an appointment with the dentist next year since that’s the only time they could get me in, so I’m just after some peace of mind. I’m hoping it’s not linked to any oral cancer, as I haven’t had any symptoms of it but my mind keeps telling me it possible that I do and it’s early stages.Pictures to help,\nCheers,\nDallasAlso, if you spot an orange tongue I’ve just eaten a mandarin honestdoc: From the images, your tongue appear as geographic.

This was my first experience with dentistry in North America and honestly i am gutted  Dear ******I am writing to address a complaint with you. \nLast year I registered at your surgery and was booked a check up with Dr ****. I was surprised when she told me I needed 2 of my larger fillings replaced (due to some hairline fractures on my teeth). As I informed her, these teeth had never given me any pain or problems and the need to replace them had never even been suggested to me by my dentist in the uk who I had last seen approximately 10 months earlier. I asked Dr **** more than once if it was really necessary to replace these fillings and was assured that yes it was. I wish I had gotten a second opinion. \nA few weeks after the procedure, the first replacement filling failed. I had irreversible pulpitis which was extremely painful and led to me having to have a root canal procedure (something that I strongly do not believe in).\nFast forward 10 months later, the second filling that was replaced by Dr ****  has now also failed. I am experiencing painful sensitivity to hot cold and sweet much like before. \nDr ****performed a bite adjust on my latest visit 2 weeks ago which unfortunately has done very little to ease the symptoms. It now seems that I am looking down the barrel at an extraction and ceramic implant. \nObviously I am extremely disappointed and frustrated. I have been told that there is a higher risk of pulpitis when the filling being replaced is as deep as mine were. If this was the case I feel that this procedure was suggested knowing that there was a high chance that this could be the outcome for me, 1 dead and 1 currently dying tooth. This does not seem like an acceptable risk to me. Sometimes isn’t it better to not fix what isn’t broken?\nI would like to let you know that I have now reached out to the College of Dental Surgeons of BC who have suggested I raise my complaint with you first before requesting them to investigate further. Yours sincerely*****"

Is that a possibility that 31 heals itself without RCT? Thanks！ honestdoc: If 31 does not respond to cold, its nerves had died (necrotic pulp).  It is a source for infection.  One option is to do a pulpectomy where the canals are cleaned and a paste called Calcium Hydroxide gets placed in to help heal the area and over time (about 2 months) if everything looks good (no pain, no swelling, good stable bone) to finish the RCT."

Eversince i was in the sixth grade,12 years ago, my permanent front tooth never grew and during that time we consulted with a dentist and he thought my front tooth was just impacted, based on the xray, so we just decided to put me on dentures and wait for it to grow (since we are not that well off).Fast forward to now, I finally have a job and decided to get braces. I had an xray but my dentist told me I never had a permanent front tooth and what I thought was my front tooth was just a bone.Can anyone confirm this?\nIt will really help my decision making about what to do with my teeth. Thank you so much! honestdoc: Your dentist was wrong.  The \"bone\" is actually the front tooth.  You have a supernumerary in its place.  Get some opinions from orthodontists.  I believe it may be more predictable to remove the supernumerary and place an implant. phoebeandgary: honestdoc said:\t\t\tYour dentist was wrong.  The \"bone\" is actually the front tooth.

I originally went to her for braces since I thought supernumerary tooth that was showing was my front tooth. But after taking a look at my xray she concluded that braces is out of my options.I did considered an implant but thats too expensive for me. So i went with fixed bridge. It just sucks that two of my teeth need to be shaved but thats my best option if I want to get rid of my dentures.Any tips on fixed bridge care? I saw some videos that the teeth decayed and I would like top prevent that. honestdoc: I don't like bridges because of the teeth drilling as you are aware.  You may experience a lot of sensitivity after the bridge prep.  You are right in that it is very important to keep the bridge clean especially under the pontic.  Be very careful not to bite into an apple, carrots, etc because the bridge can be more fragile."

I have seen that odd looking area for years on my x-rays and a dentist has never mentioned it.When he was doing the inspection he said he could feel the lip and said I needed a new crown. 1. Is having a little lip a reason to need a new crown that is 4 years old?2. They added buildup to my charges. Do I need buildup when replacing a crown?3. They are giving me a metal/porcelain crown (the code says it is a noble metal crown) but they also added on a line that says zirc origin upgrade 5 year warranty for another 250.00. What is this? Thank you! honestdoc: Could you provide the x-ray?  I don't like PFMs because the porcelain layer can fracture off.  I like full contour (not layered) zirconia.

Teeth shift every day.  I tell my patients if they lose a crown, they must come back to recement it ASAP because the back teeth tends to shift forward and the opposing teeth will shift into the lost crown making recementation impossible.

PA is WNL and no clinical or radiographic signs of excess cement. I checked/adjusted the occlusion on the distal marginal ridge, which is the area the pt says bothers him the most when he's eating.

We cannot diagnose without a clinical exam and x-rays.  If the x-rays are negative then the white spots will be hypo-mineralization and the red gums is gingivitis.  However, the x-rays could also show deep internal decay and possible bone damage which is why you need to see an available dentist."

I called to insurance company and they gave me a breakdown of the charges by the endodontist which was close to the $4,000.Of course, I am shock and disappoint because now, I have to get 3 crowns and there is no money in my dental insurance coverage to pay for. When I spoke to my regular dentist, he said the my out of pocket cost for the 3 crowns(since there is no money left in my insurance plan) is $4,300 which is the discounted rate they would normally bill to my insurance company.I don't have that type of money to pay for 3 crowns and I don't think it would be safe to leave my teeth like this until January when the new insurance year kicks. in.What are my options.?I heard that there are some dental schools with dentist in training that may charge a discounted rate?Any other suggestions?

Why can’t I just have a normal filling? Does anyone know? I’m a little concerned that if the temp filling fails I’ll be left with an exposed nerve. My dentist doesn’t want to do a root canal on the tooth and says I might need to have it removed if the temp filling doesn’t work. All in all I’m a little confused about the whole progress. Could anyone enlighten me please? honestdoc: Do you have pain and or discomfort with the tooth particularly when you chew?  Your dentist want to place sedative materials to allow the nerve to heal and not traumatize it if a normal filling that is very close can do.  I like modern glass ionomer materials like Fuji Equia which helps desensitize the nerve and pulpal protectant like Pulpdent's Lime-Lite.  Depending on how deep the filling, this can be placed as a final restoration.  Aslo depending on how big the filling is, you may need a crown.  The tooth most likely will get cold sensitive and if so, do not overwhelm it since the cold can damage the nerve."

    "dialogue": "gkr334: I have 5 cavities in my posterior teeth including the wisdom teeth. I have visited a few dentists before, they say the best option would be Glass Ionomer Cement, GIC.They neither suggested me composite nor amalgam filling. As in composite filling, tooth should be kept very dry which is difficult to maintain in the posterior and wisdom teeth. Even though amalgam filling would last much longer, suitable for posterior teeth and can withstand chewing forces but it requires a larger tooth structure has to be removed resulting in weaker tooth. Also I already have 2 amalgam fillings.But I didn't went for normal GIC filling because it can only last upto an average of 5 years.I researched about new dental filling materials which had the benefits of both GIC and Amalgam, is suitable for posterior teeth and would last longer. And I got to know about Zirconia Reinforced GIC.I read the research papers, and surprisingly, this material provides mechanical strength equal to that of Amalgam. And on top of that, it provides the benefits of GIC such as flouride release and lesser removal of tooth structure.So what dentists have to say on this new material and do they practice it? MattKW: I had to look this up. The reports I read didn't give much detail and there appear to be no long-term studies. GIC should also be placed without moisture contamination. I'd suggest you either a  composite or amalgam placed under a rubber dam to keep moisture out of it. It's not necessarily true that amalgam requires more tooth removal. Often the decay creates enough retention without further drilling than usual."

Dr M: Good dayA seizure is of the most common medical emergencies a dentist can encounter. Usually the dentist tries to minimize the damage the patient can do to himself by moving all harmful equipment away and then monitoring the patient. If the seizure continues for more than 5 min and the dentist is capable, he can give some Diazepam. After the attack, the patient's air way should be monitored, since the patients smooth muscles relax, including the airway muscles. \nI would then refer the patient to a medical practitioner for an examination, who will then decide to refer to a neurologist if applicable."

    "dialogue": "gummy44: I find myself in an urgent situation and would appreciate assistance and/or reassurance. My son recently was fitted for a night mouth guard, and when the technician was removing the mold tray, she pulled it out quite forcefully resulting in a 7mm round scrape of gum being removed exposing his jawbone! This is directly under his back molar. There was no bleeding, he thought he was hurting from his routine cleaning. He’s been in quite severe pain. When we returned to tell her, she said that gum will grow over the exposed jawbone and gave him oracort to be applied 4 times a day, together with Tylenol 3 for the pain. It’s been 10 days since and it looks the same, no new gum tissue seems to be growing to cover the scrape and cover his exposed jaw bone! I’ve googled everything I can think of, but can’t find an answer to whether gum will grow over and fill in over his jaw bone. Will he need a gum graft procedure or will it eventually close with time? He can’t eat anything but soft food and it’s been terrifying thinking that gum will not grow back. Thank you for reading and would appreciate any assistance! Dr M: Good dayDo you perhaps have a photo of the area? It is very unusual to remove gum tissue and exposing bone during an impression. gummy44: Good evening Dr M,I appreciate your reply, and I thank you! It’s quite difficult to take a photo as I can’t get back enough to focus. The photo I’m attaching “may” show the white “lesion” or is a reflection in the mirror of a tooth? We went back to the dentist yesterday and she now said that the white scrape doesn’t appear to be either his impacted wisdom tooth, nor is it his exposed jawbone! She said the scrape appears to be healing as it went from a size of 7mm round last week, to 6mm by 5mm yesterday. My son feels no evidence of healing as he’s experiencing severe pain still. She now says that perhaps his gum is also bruised from the trauma and that she does feel thin gum there. She assured us that it was NOT osteonecrosis, and that it should heal and pink up again in a few weeks. She doesn’t find it necessary for a referral to an oral surgeon to look at it instead to continue with the Oracort and Tylenol and to follow up with her again next week to monitor any possible healing progress. He was healthy before the mouth guard impression but this is still frightening. Do you believe that the gum will pink up and the white patch will heal and disappear? I still don’t understand why it’s white and looks like bone. Thank you again for reaching out to me! Dr M: Good dayUsually a traumatic lesion can appear yellow as healing progresses, due to scar tissue or granulation tissue formation. This will then gradually transition to pink.\nI would maybe consider using additional anti-inflammatory medication. Tylenol does not have strong inflammatory properties. \nI would monitor this area only. I also agree that it should heal by itself. gummy44: Good day Dr MThank you for your reassurance, and I greatly appreciate your reply and following up with me!In addition to the Oracort and Tylenol 3, the dentist also prescribed \nChlorhexidine Gluconate oral rinse and Tantum oral rinse on our last follow up visit 2 days ago. He’s also been using salt water rinses a few times a day. The dentist had initially prescribed Naproxen 500mg for the pain but at the time it did little to alleviate it, so that’s why she then prescribed Tylenol 3 on our last visit. As Naproxen is an anti inflammatory perhaps he can once again try it instead of the Tylenol, being the better choice as an anti inflammatory medication for his pain. His gums and lesion are still quite inflamed and painful, and he’s still only eating soft food. It’s difficult to tell whether the lesion has any yellow tinge to it (not as white as bone) to verify whether the healing process has begun. We will be following up with her again next week for monitoring. Do you know a rough timeline on how long the healing process will ultimately take?I thank you again for your assistance, reassurance and explanation of the healing process and that he will heal in time!"

    "title": "Getting dentures or not?",
    "dialogue": "trabian: Hello, I am 56 yo and have been living with bad teeth all my life. I was a neglected child and was never taught to brush properly (among many other things). I had my first checkup at 5 and my milk teeth were so bad that they had to put me into general anesthesia and surgically remove some of the teeth. Between 6 and 8, my front permanent teeth began to stick out outside my milk teeth, especially the upper ones. These milk teeth were later extracted instead of falling out naturally, but had already caused a severe overbite. Practically all my teeth already had caries and fillings by the time I was 12. I'm trying to understand how this all came to be without any plan of intervention to try to salvage some of the damage, and it was probably a combination of neglect from my parents and the fact that my parents kept moving to another city or country every 1 or 2 years. When my wisdom teeth came out, things got even worse because they pushed my front teeth into a jumble. I simply got by with it. I have very thick lips and my mouth was always slightly open at rest, and my lips were always dry and cracked.About 10 years ago a dentist suggested I had my premolars removed. I was stupid enough to not get a second opinion, because I was very afraid of going to another dentist. After the extractions and the orthodontic treatment I could at least close my mouth properly, but now when I smile you can't really see my teeth if I'm not grinning very broadly. I've been very unhappy and self-conscious about smiling ever since. I was recommended another dentist who studied the situation, and I got braces to try to pull the teeth forward and maybe have new premolar implants on the lower row. I was in treatment for 18 months and finally got my money back because they hadn't really managed any result. I later went to a supposedly even better dentist, but she said that even with new implants it wouldn't be possible to get my teeth forward significantly, to make them \"show\" as with a normal set of teeth. The situation today is that I'm starting to lose molars, many have enormous fillings that are starting to fail after so many years and the teeth crack from top to bottom. I had two extracted last year and probably one more will go soon. The enamel of my teeth is also very deteriorated, and just a couple of days after a cleaning by the dentist they're dark and spotty again from drinking tea and coffee. Today I still brush and floss and go to checkups, but it's as if my teeth don't exist, I've given up, I'm not sentimentally attached to them and would gladly pull them all out. I'd very much like to be able to smile and see my teeth in a photo with other people, but right now it's like an empty hole between my lips. My fear is that my gums and bones underneath won't permit a set of dentures to look \"normal\"...Has anyone had a similar experience, or is there a professional here that has treated a similar case successfully? Any response would be appreciated. Dr M: Good dayIt is difficult to give an opinion without knowing the exact state or condition your remaining teeth are in. It is important to note however that with aging, you lose the natural elasticity in your face. This means showing less and less teeth as you get older. For an opinion of exactly what can be done, we would need to do a full clinical examination , to evaluate the condition of the remaining the teeth. the condition of the supporting structures of the mouth, such as your alveolar bone and gum tissues. trabian: Dr M said:\t\t\tGood dayIt is difficult to give an opinion without knowing the exact state or condition your remaining teeth are in.

I am aware that an examination is necessary for a qualified opinion. Maybe what I'd like to hear here are simply examples of similar cases or others' personal experiences, because I feel very lost right now. Also, perhaps you or other professionals may have some general thoughts about the following: How many teeth do people usually lose before a full denture is considered? I don't like the thought of partial dentures or just filling the gaps with implants since the state of my remaining teeth is so bad and in 10-15 years they're probably going to fail anyway. At the same time it seems a bit radical to pull everything out, because my teeth are largely functional at this time although I have some gaps in the back.\nCan dentures work well even though they're not exactly aligned with the original gums and the bones underneath? I mean, in order to correct a large overbite?\nDo people of my age (56) generally get implants or dentures, when everything is removed? I'm trying to think pragmatically: costs, maintenance, general satisfaction etc. I do have some resources tucked away for this, but spending more than a sports car's worth on the treatment (like Iggy Pop) seems extravagant to me.\nRegards, \nTrabian Dr M: To answer your questions :1) It depends. I was taught that if you have at least 8 occluding teeth, this should be enough to function. But this differs from person to person and where these teeth are located. 2) If you decide to go the denture route, you will most likely be looking at what we call immediate dentures. This is where the dentures are manufactured and then all the teeth are extracted upon delivery of the denture. This is usually what I like to call a \" guesstimate \", because the teeth are set up in such a way to provide optimal function, but not always optimal aesthetics, since you can't have a try in visit to see how they would look like, while you still have teeth in your mouth. You can still have some improvement on the overbite you mentioned. \nAfter the teeth has been extracted, your alveolar bone remodels. This can sometimes take a year. After this, a new set can be planned out and made to suit your specific functional and aesthetic requirements. It is important to note that removable dentures will never ever be as comfortable as your own teeth. Since it is REMOVABLE.3) You can get either implants or dentures at your age. This choice is only dictated by your available tooth supporting structures as mentioned previously and finances. For an estimate you will have to go for a consult first, with your dentist or treating specialist. trabian: Thank you again for your professional opinion, Dr M. What you say about the guesstimate worries me since I'm very concerned about the aesthetics, in fact it's the main reason I'm considering dentures right now since my remaining teeth are at least functional. A denture with teeth in the same position as now would still be invisible when I smile, however white and perfect they are.Btw I've now read a bit about fixed dentures, wouldn't that be a good option if one removes all the existing teeth? I would still like to hear from someone that has gone through something like this, from a patient's view. Dr M: For fixed prosthesis, you will need an evaluation from a dentist or dental specialist, in order to see the quantity and quality of bone you have to work with. Fixed dentures are attached to implants. This process can be expensive"

Recently, when I requested my dental x-rays the dentist sent me the following.   What is the standard of care these days when giving x-rays to patients?Thanks. Dr M: Good dayWe don't take peri-apical x-rays of each individual tooth if not indicated. Ethically each dentist should follow the ALARA principle when it comes to taking x-rays. This stands for \" as low as reasonably acceptable \" in terms of radiation exposure. This means that we only take x-rays when there is a clear indication or need for it. Your dentist sent you copies of the x-rays he felt he needed to take. \nIn some cases these days, your dental insurance also only pays for a certain amount of x-rays, which limits the amount the dentist takes. joey: Thanks for the helpful reply.  When looking at the x-rays he sent some only show partial teeth and some don't show the gum line.\nWould these x-rays be helpful to another dentist? Dr M: Yes they would. These \" bite-wing x-rays \" are used to evaluate cavities or fillings in-between teeth and not the teeth roots."

There appears to be a defect or something at the gum line across from tooth #9\nLooking forward to your comments. Dr M: Good dayIt looks there is an air bubble in the porcelain itself, and if there might be inadequate seal of the margins of the crown. This could be as a result of impressions or scans not done properly or contacts between teeth not checked prior to seating, resulting in slightly open margins, which might lead to micro-leakage."

When I finally did, it was because I needed a root canal, badly. And that experience made me want to get serious. The first guy I saw did a ton of work, something like 19 fillings all at once all around my mouth. My bite was never quite the same, and he made a lot of adjustments over the next few years as I was clacking and it was causing pain. My bite is unbelievably bad now, my teeth no longer fit together. I'm a heavy grinder. I can destroy crowns if they're not the right material with my bite. I wear a store bought night guard now, which helps a lot, but I destroy one about every six months. I have a lot of large fillings in my molars, and now it seems like every time I go in and they find something, I need a new crown. It is costing a fortune to maintain my mouth, and I'm miserable and the teeth still don't look very good. I've had 5 root canals and have 7 crowns so far, as well as an implant on #19.What are my options at this point? My teeth make me absolutely miserable. There is a long standing thought that although it may be challenging, I might be happier just getting them pulled and having dentures. If the best option is to keep getting all this incremental work until I have at least 16 crowns, what are some methods of keeping the costs from becoming crippling? MattKW: Unfortunately dentistry is a form of smash repairs. There is not much that can be guaranteed to work for a long time, and the more complicated your situation, the worse it becomes. \nYou mention that you crack crowns - this is unusual. I would suggest you talk to a prosthodontist about reassessing your current occlusion, and consider replacing some molar crowns with gold crowns."

One extraction and one root canal.\nThey were ready to do immediately but I was NOT ready, just did not have the cash on me and they were willing to write me a script for pain meds in the interim of appointment.  Scheduled appointment for the following day.4 - Came for my appointment the next day, sat in dental chair and front desk personnel comes into room and required payment upfront before anything is done.  I was fine with that, really had no choice.  So I paid her $650.00 while in chair and she said she will email me receipt in 5 minutes, not a problem for me.5 - Cosmetic* dentist came in (same women I did limited evaluation with) to do root canal and completed.\n*Per dentist.\nAfterwards, the Endodontist came in room to do extraction and that was fine too, few minutes.6 - Procedure was done and right before I am about to leave, cosmetic dentist told me I have to come back next week for second part of root canal which will be another $350.00.This was a total shock to me and was certainly deceptive and nobody told me a second visit was needed with more money.All thoughts/opinions/advice are much appreciated! honestdoc: The $350 should have been explained prior to treatment.  I don't know what all the procedures were so I couldn't tell if they scammed you.  Was this at a chain like Aspen Dental or Heartland?  How were your dental visits prior?  Do you have dental insurance?  They should always give you different options like extraction instead of root canal.  After a root canal on the back teeth, you will need a core build up and crown which can get expensive.  My advice is to go to a dental office you trust where you see the same dentist.  Try to go regularly to minimize any surprise emergencies. MattKW: Did you get initial quote in printed form? Always good to ask before starting any treatment so we can see what was proposed, and you have it in writing.

My tooth colour is slightly different than the rest now but not very obvious, i do have a lot of tooth structure. But would i need a crown or not to protect it? As i had a lot of work done to it. Thank you Dr M: Good dayIn terms of the tooth color, you can sometimes get quite an improvement with a procedure called non-vital bleaching. You can ask your dentist about this. Basically it is bleaching the crown of a root canal treated tooth from the inside.\nSecondly it is not necessary to have the tooth crowned, if you have enough tooth structure left. Just keep in mind that all root canal treated teeth are technically dead teeth and can become brittle and break over time, especially when accidentally biting into something that is too hard. MattKW: Lateral incisors are small teeth. I would try internal bleaching (your dentist) to see if you could lighten it. I would be very unlikely to suggest a crown because while you might improve the appearance, you will weaken the tooth - the crown won't strengthen it in this type of case."

    "dialogue": "Sky: had a filling done in April as my older filling was getting cracked. I had no pain or other issues in the tooth area. After the filling was done my mouth was numb that evening and I was in pain. From the next day onwards I was extremely sensitive to anything cold around that tooth. This went on for a couple of weeks and I went back to the dentist thinking something was wrong with my filling. And they told me it was gum erosion/damage. It’s been 2 months since then and the gum hasn’t healed though the pain isn’t as bad as it was in April. I guess my question is, can the gums get damaged during the filling process? It’s suspicious to me that there was no gum damage the day I went to get the filling and a week later the damage was so bad that it still hasn’t healed? Trying to understand what happened and if I can trust the dentist or should I find another provider? Dr M: Good day. \nJust to clarify some of the terminology..what you have might either be enamel erosion or abrasion,  or gum recession. Both of this could lead to sensitivity. This is also something that won't disappear with time. All that you can do is manage the symptoms. Try rubbing some Sensodyne toothpaste on the affected area for about 1 minute, and then don't rinse your mouth with water. This sometimes help to manage the symptoms. Also switch to a toothbrush that is soft. In severe cases you might also need a filling to cover the damaged areas.It is important to keep in mind that the sensitivity could also be due to a defective filling or filling close to the nerve of the tooth. Impossible to give advice on this without more information like an x-ray."

I wouldn’t say it’s a phobia but when I was 16 I had a tooth smashed by someone and my experience wasn’t great. Since that treatment I’ve avoided going. Today I looked at my teeth using my phone light. My teeth are absolutely riddled with little holes, some as many as ten in a tooth and they obviously need filling before it progresses. Most are small ones that would ordinarily be filled I think but I don’t know how dentists go about filling these. Can they drill out multiple holes in a tooth and fill at the same time per tooth?Thanks for any replies. honestdoc: Your questions are valid.  The answers are it depends.  First thing the dentist will do is take x-rays.  They are like a road map of your teeth and I will never drill on a tooth without them.  They are necessary because we don't know where or how deep the cavities will get inside your tooth and where the nerve in the root canal will be.  We can't see the bone health under your gums without them.  If you have multiple holes in one tooth, it depends on the size of those holes.  You may need to have a crown if the holes get too big for the tooth to remain strong enough.I am very big on prevention of cavities.  I would evaluate the patient and if he or she has rampant cavities all over, I would have a serious discussion on why they are deteriorating because fillings will also get cavities under them and you can potentially lose all of your teeth. ChrisR: Thanks for the reply. My teeth were pretty perfect until I was in my mid to late twenties. One cavity and no other issues. I went to rural Kenya for 30 months in 2010 and due to where I was I didn’t have access to dental care or indeed the means to properly clean teeth sometimes. It was also not unusual to find fizzy drinks (coca cola) specifically which I’d regularly have as the only available luxury. I came back from there in 2013 with more than a few small cavities I’d guess. In any case I developed a tendency to drink the fizzy drinks even when I returned and it wasn’t uncommon for me to wake in the middle of the night and eat or drink something without then brushing teeth again. I’ve had no real pain and the cavities have actually been unnoticeable to the naked eye without using a bright light. In any case I haven’t been eating or drinking sugary foods since January and my tooth care routine now is pretty good. I brush after every meal, floss and use mouthwash. Probably excessively so if I’m honest. I certainly won’t go down this road again. If I had a starting point where I could maintain the health of my teeth I’d certainly keep it up. To tell you the truth embarrassment inhibits me from going to the dentist but I do have an appointment booked. As much as I want to cancel it and save myself the shame of it all I guess it needs doing. honestdoc: There should be no embarrassment visiting the dentist.  You should find a dentist you trust.  In the US, we have an oversupply of dentists in big cities and suburbs and a shortage in the rural areas.  I see a lot of members of the underserved population with severe problems."

I have a cleaning appointment for this Friday and I'm wondering if I should wait till then or go earlier? Dr M: Good dayI don't see a need to go in earlier. It can wait. Try applying some sensitive toothpaste to the affected tooth by rubbing it on for about  a minute and then NOT rinsing your mouth afterwards. I have found this sometimes reduces the sensitivity a lot. If this doesn't help,it might be necessary to do a filling in that area. Anxious person: Thank you so much"

One practice was my preferred but is sadly out of my price range in central London. The second practice is a local London team who seem very experienced with the dentist overseeing the orthodontics being \nqualified as a Dentist from Liverpool Dental School in 1993 and worked as a vocational trainee in Hertfordshire. He then spent three years working in hospital, when he gained his Fellowship in Oral Surgery qualifications from both the Edinburgh and London Colleges.\nIn 1997 he began his specialist orthodontic training at Kings and Guildford hospitals. He gained his MSc and MOrth qualifications and completed his training in 2000. Since then, he has been busy developing his specialist orthodontic practice in South-East London and has trained in the provision of Invisalign, Damon and Lingual braces. He was the Secretary and then the Chairman of the Orthodontic Specialists Group of the British Orthodontic Society from 2009 - 2014. In 1999 he began his legal training, and was called to the English Bar in 2006. As well as his clinical work as an Orthodontist he also serves as a Chariman on the GDC's fitness to practice panel.I found his manner a little bit offhand but hen assessed me, did a report and would oversee the orthodontics with a specialist consultant who works in hospitals and lectures doing the restorative work. Obviously they’re very experienced but I can’t find reviews on their work and from patients and the one treatment I had from that specialist dentist I have no way of assessing how good it is but I know that it took 2 1/2 hours in the chair (cleaning out decay and putting a post in) with a lot of dribble around my mouth. I also don’t find him particularly good at explaining things.The other practice is a slick modern practice focusing on cosmetics/aesthetic’s which appeals to me actually because if I’m spending all this money I might well have a good looking smile and beautiful teeth. However, I found it a little concerning that the principle Dentist charged me £79 for an initial consultation but I’m getting no report from that and it was really just a chat about what I want and what his approach is. He refuses to give me a report or even a rough estimate first saying that I need the orthodontics done before they can look at what I need doing.I’m 59 and it would be nice to straighten my teeth although they’re not terrible but a little bit overcrowded and uneven and I understand as you get older they move so this might get worse. The orthodontics isn’t essential for me so I don’t even mind saving the money if anyone on here thinks it’s not worth doing. \nOpinions please!"

Went back today and next week he wants to do another surgery to remove the abnormal piece of bone and \"clean out\" my sinuses, which I assume means removing the infection. Is that a thing? What is this procedure called and would this be better to have an ent look at me? My fear is that I will pay all this money to get the bone removed and sinus cleaned out and will still be having this pain. He hasn't really answered whether it will solve the pain issue, just keeps saying I have a sinus infection and that there was a lot of infection where the teeth were. But I've been on antibiotics since last Monday, shouldn't the sinus infection have cleared up by now? Dr M: Good day\nHas your dentist been trained in oral surgery? If not, it best to have a maxillo facial surgeon look at the problem. rdk2020: Dr M said:\t\t\tGood day\nHas your dentist been trained in oral surgery? If not, it best to have a maxillo facial surgeon look at the problem.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...yes, he is also an oral surgeon. I got more info from their office that he is performing a sinus lift, but he has kept saying he will clean it all out while he is doing this. I guess I am just worried that this is not going to address the problem of the pain I am having. Dr M: If he is a qualified oral surgeon, then he should know what he is talking about, and will be able to clean out the sinuses as well as remove the bone piece that is in question. No need to go see an ENT"

    "dialogue": "Tex: Hi. I know no one can solve my problems based on what I write here but I hope someone can give me a hint.Over the past few weeks, I did several teeth repairs including 1 extraction and 3 root canals. Now I have 2 problems that the dentist cannot solve.1.) I have pain in my last 2 top teeth on my right side. The dentist did the filling on both of them and took an x-ray afterward which shows no cavities left. However, the pain is so bad that I can't chew. What makes it more confusing the pain is exactly in between the teeth. (not the gum). When I put a toothpick in between the 2 teeth I can't tell which one is hurting. They both do. Is there a way to figure which one is hurting?2) The second issue that the dentist is puzzled about is my 3rd tooth on top from the back on the left side. On that one, I did a root canal a year ago and it broke a few weeks ago and started hurting on the spot where it broke. I got it filled but the pain remains. The dentist removed and filled the painful part but then the other side of the tooth hurt. He did it again and took an x-ray but the pain is still there. Any suggestions? Dr M: Good dayDo you perhaps have any photos or x-rays of your teeth?Regarding your first question, it could be that the occlusion or bite on the filled teeth are not correct, leading to an increase in pressure of the ligaments surrounding the teeth, and then the resulting pain. \nIt could also be areas of exposed dentine due to recession of the gums, causing pain. \nHow deep are the fillings? Again, x-rays will really be helpful.Secondly, the root canal treated tooth, could either have a crack in, that is not visible with the naked eye or 2D x-rays, or the root canal itself could have been compromised due to microleakage. This would have led to the root canal starting to fail, and in such a case, a re-treatment might be indicated. Also have the occlusion checked on this tooth.In the end, it could be a lot of things, but we would need more information to be more helpful.

My dentist did mention the possibility of it being broken (the one with a root canal) but nothing else and will probably send me to a specialist. The second photo is not taken from the side but of complete mouth because they want to order a night guard. I took the best picture I could and the pain is exactly between the 2 teeth right in the center where those red lines are pointing to. When I chew on something solid I can't tell which tooth hurts more because they both do. The last 2 on the bottom same side have been done after this x-ray was taken but they too hurt although not as bad but that prevents me from finding out which tooth is more painful on the both sides.When you have 4 painful teeth that push on each other it is hard to tell which one hurts the most. But I am not concerned with the bottom ones it's these upper 2 on the x-ray and the one on the other x-ray I attached.Thank You Dr M: I agree with your dentist. If the root canal is still giving problems, it is best you consider seeing a specialist endodontist.\nOn the other x-ray, I can see that the top tooth, right at the back, has a very large filling, close to the pulp or nerve of the tooth. Over time, such a large filling, could lead to a pulpitis of the nerve ( inflammation). If the pulpitis becomes irreversible, it might be an inidication for root canal treatment on that tooth as well. I would still check the occlusion or bite on these teeth first. \nHave you been taking anti-inflammatory medication? This could help.\nIf you are being referred to an endodontist, you can have him look at these teeth as well."

    "dialogue": "Two30: hi all, I know there is no right or wrong answer but I've been given the difficult decision of a root canal or extraction.\nIts on one of my molar teeth on the bottom, 3rd tooth from the back.\nthe tooth has had a couple fillings on it in the past and now has started to cause me pain and have a slight infection near the tooth root / nerve. Will the tooth having work on it in the past and causing me problems the last 3 months have any bearing on root canal?\nAny advice on which option to go with? Dr M: Good dayIf the tooth has a large filling or fillings on it, it might be and indication that after the root canal has been completed, you would need a crown on the tooth. A root canal treated tooth is technically a dead tooth and can become brittle over time with a high risk of fracture. The cost of the additional crown will have to be kept in mind. The fact that there is currently infection, should not have bearing on the root canal procedure. Severe infection might only mean more than the usual number of visits to complete the root canal. Two30: thanks for the reply.\nI'm just so undecided what to do, if having the tooth extracted will this cause other teeth to be extracted in the future or can I still keep a good set of healthy teeth after one extraction?\nThe extraction is just seeming like a more viable option due to I have a feeling after having root canal I could end up having it out anyway with the tooth not getting better after it.\nThe tooth does have a deep filling on it at the moment. Dr M: One extraction won't mean you will lose all your teeth. Unfortunately the risk is always there that a root canal can also fail and then extraction is the only option. Once the tooth is extracted, you will have options to replace it, which you can discuss with your dentist. Two30: also, could I just ask another question.\nI did have a deep filling done on the tooth ( which previously had a filling on but was still experiencing discomfort ). the tooth has been sensitive for 4/5 weeks since the filling especially to cold things and then the weekend just gone I was in serious pain and agony, but when I woke up Monday morning the pain was no where near as bad as it was and the sensitivity the tooth had is no longer there.\nI still took a trip to the dentist due to the pain I was in and then obviously they told me as above - root canal or extraction.\nwhy did the pain really flare up the weekend then not so bad now and sensitivity all gone? I may opt for the root canal in hope it can keep my tooth. Dr M: Once the nerve gets inflamed, you go through times of spontaneous pain, while the nerve slowly dies."

    "title": "Tartar coming back in a month",
    "dialogue": "UglyToothJoe: I always had problems with tartar formation, bit in the recent months it got to a whole new level.I didn't change anything in my eating habits. No sugar, brushing everyday three times a day for about 20mins each time.I used to get a cleaning every 6 months and i had quite some tartar, but nothing troublesome.Now my lower front teeth build tons of tartar in a month or even less. The dentist here keeps cleaning, but it comes back super quickly.I have a strong gum recession in one of my front teeth, it's been like that all my life. Now the tooth is moving a bit, but no pain or swelling.Just this tartar building up incredibly quickly.What is possibly going on? Dr M: Good dayFirstly tartar build up could be because of a lot of reasons. It could be that you are brushing, but neglecting to floss, and then plaque builds up in between the teeth where your tooth brush can't reach. Secondly, if you have a lot of crowding of your lower incisors, cleaning can be difficult in between these teeth, leading to build-up. Are you using a mouth rinse as an adjunct to normal brushing and flossing?\nIt is important to keep in mind, that recession as well as tooth mobility, might be an indication of periodontal disease. Brushing excessively for 20 minutes, can actually be harmful as well, since you might cause damage to the supporting tissues around your teeth.\nI think it is important to be evaluated for periodontal disease. You might be in need of a deep cleaning. UglyToothJoe: Thank you for your response. I do suffer from periodontal disease. I would add screenshots if I knew how to do it. Tooth 31 already has a 9mm pocket. It's moving a bit and I already know it's gonna go. My current dentist suggested an implant as only solution, he never mentioned deep cleaning (you mean SRP?).The tartar is forming only on the lower part of my teeth, not really in the flossing area, but maybe this is irrelevant?Thing is I can't understand why so quickly. Until 3 months ago I needed just the usual 6 clean up every 6 months, then it changed all of a sudden. Dr M: With periodontal disease, you might require more regular cleanings. If you have a deep pocket or pockets, food can get trapped here, making it almost impossible to clean conventionally. Have you been referred to a periodontist for evaluation? UglyToothJoe: So SRP can't help with this.The dentist said already that food doesn't get trapped, as I have wide spaces between my front teeth due to other problems, which actually makes cleaning easier, but somehow I can't prevent this tartar. Dr M: Pockets can lead to areas that are plaque retentive, even if your teeth are widely spaced. Has your dentist referred you to a periodontist as per my previous question? UglyToothJoe: No, they didn't. They just told me to go back every week to check how the tartar builds up Dr M: Ask for a referral to a periodontist. This is a specialist that deals with periodontal disease and can give you a better idea of what steps to follow as well as possible reasons for the tartar build up."

So yesterday, he filled it again, after making a tooth hole so infection could come out, I guess. It was 3 appointments. But now, every couple minutes I feel a throbbing heartbeat sensation in my tooth, I’ve been taking my antibiotics, but it hurts extremely bad, can’t bite on anything on that side of my mouth, my other teeth have even become sensitive around where the filling was placed.

Told me to change the tooth paste to Sensodyne rapid relief and different tooth brush.I had multiple tooth interventions in the past (not at that tooth) and this is nothing like what I have experienced before. I's a strange situation where I feel a strange pain (only on small and medium pressure) and the tooth seems to be OK.Is this something to do with tooth sensibility?? Or do you think its something else ? honestdoc: Having an image where the root tip is captured (Periapical angulation) may help.  There may be different possibilities.  You may be stressed and you grind/clench without knowing it.  You may have an anterior open bite where your lower incisors are not contacting against the tooth and it may be slightly hyper-erupting.  You may have a history of trauma or braces. riegel41: Thank you for taking time to respond! I don't have a history of trauma or braces. Only thing that I changed, 3 weeks before any pain started, was my toothpaste. I decided to try Colgate Active Charcoal. Two weeks after the first symptoms I changed the toothpaste to Sensodyne protect and repair.Only logical explanation that seems reasonable is that by using the charcoal toothpaste the dentin canaliculi were exposed, making the tooth sensible. The only problem with this is that I feel no pain at cold or hot stimuli. You are right, it would have been good to capture the entire root. But the nurse was really clumsy. She give me two doses of X-Ray because se forgot to plug something during the first one. Anyhow, I don't think is something wrong at the tip of the root, because we can see almost all of it. I have to be extremely unlucky to have an infection at the very tip of the root with no gums inflammation or constant pain. Only explanation for now is:  Colgate Active Charcoal -> exposed dentin canaliculi -> maybe some pulp inflammation (hopefully reversible if this is the case). If the pulp is inflamed without any visual effects (gums...) is there any medication for it  ? If I take some anti-inflammatory, just in case, is OK ?"

I made the appointment and it's coming up in a couple days so I don't really have flexibility to go to another dentist. Can any dental professional check this out? It's tooth 16, and it's crowned + root canaled. I also put up tooth x ray 13 + 14 because it had also had tooth 16 in it. honestdoc: It is tooth #15 and I see the defect they are talking about (Mesial margin).  I don't think it is urgent that you need a new crown.  Depending on how well you clean your teeth, I've seen crowns like that have no problems for many years.  I've also seen crowns decay if you drink a lot of sugary beverages. trey_songzzz1234: honestdoc said:honestdoc said:\t\t\tIt is tooth #15 and I see the defect they are talking about (Mesial margin).

    "dialogue": "rs1971: Hi,\nI am 51 years old and as a result of a gum infection that has not responded to antibiotics I am about to lose my first tooth to extraction.  The tooth in question is my forward most molar (third from the back) on the lower left hand side.  I have a couple of questions about my options with respect to what comes after the extraction.The dentist suggested that I could either get an implant or use braces to pull the rearmost two molars forward to cover the gap  So my first question concerns the advantages and disadvantages of those two options.  I know that an implant is more expensive, but what are the other differences?  Would repositioning the other teeth via brace be more or less effective in the long run?  Any other issues with either approach to consider?Secondly, if the gap isn't noticeable as I suspect it won't be as I don't have a wide smile, how deleterious an effect would it have on my other teeth if I just did nothing?  And if that were a bad idea, how long would it take for said effects to start to manifest themselves? (ie, is there any reason to rush into a decision?Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer! Dr M: Good day\nDoing nothing is an option yes. Over time, as your teeth move, the teeth behind the gap will tilt and try and close the gap. This happens over a period of months to years. In the mean time, you might have an irritation of food going through the gap when chewing, but a lot of people get used to one gap quite quickly.\nI am not convinced that one implant and crown will cost you less than orthodontic treatment. This depends on a lot of factors. If you had a \" severe gum \" infection, which resulted in tooth loss, it might be that you actually have periodontal disease. If this is the case, probing has to be done around all your remaining teeth, in order to evaluate their periodontal status. Any teeth that are periodontally compromised, are not ideal candidates for orthodontic treatment and in active periodontal disease I would not consider implant treatment as well. I would make sure the rest of my mouth is okay first, before commencing with the next stage of treatment.

I actually live right on the border of Mexico and while it's probably not a popular option on the board, if I decide to get an implant, I might investigate a dentist in Los Algadones (basically a hub of dental tourism).Thanks again for taking the time to reply! Dr M: If your periodontal disease is stable-which I hope was confirmed with a periodontist, I would rather opt for the implant treatment. This minimizes the periodontal trauma on the rest of your teeth. If you move a lot of teeth, especially those which were periodontally compromised in the past, there is a higher risk of complications. You will have to confirm that you have enough quantity and quality of bone though, to support an implant"

The question is how long will it last?  There are a lot of factors like bone and root health, amount of remaining coronal structure, your biting patterns and how thorough is your homecare (brushing and flossing). setondwg: Are you looking to receive tooth-coloured fillings in Cranston? If you would like to receive tooth-coloured fillings near you, it's possible to receive them on any tooth. As long as your wisdom tooth is healthy and not causing any pain or issues, you can receive a filling. Wisdom teeth are only recommended to be extracted if they are causing pain, grown in at an angle, or your jaw has no room to accommodate them. They are typically removed to prevent future oral health problems from occurring. You can speak to your dentist to see if a filing will suffice for your wisdom tooth or if it requires removal.

I have an achy jaw and tender jaw joint on the right.  This doesn't really bother me too much, the problem is, I also have an ache in the 2nd from last tooth on the top on both the left and right sides on and off. I have had these teeth checked by my dentist a few times (x-ray, percussion, sensitivity) and she can see nothing wrong with the teeth. The pain alternates between either side and I never have it on both sides at the same time / same day. For that reason my dentist thinks it due to me clenching / grinding my teeth as its hopping from tooth to tooth.  This has been ongoing for the last 6 weeks and it driving me mad. Ive had daily pain on one or other side each day. There is no stimulus I can point to that brings on the ache - I can eat and drink hot or cold without any immediate or shooting pain or sensitivity and it usually lasts from mid morning until the afternoon. My question is, is this typical of grinding tooth pain and if my dentist cant see anything wrong, is there else can I turn to try and sort this or do I just accept its grinding pain?

    "dialogue": "madmaxnightrider: I know it looks like I have Periodontal Disease but my Dentist said nothing about it to me. I am having an aching tooth pain anytime I eat something with Sugar in it or when I lay down flat but the pain goes away after about 30 minutes if I use Hydrogen Peroxide & Salt Water. Could it be that my teeth are worn down to the Dentin & they are Sensitive or could it be my 2 Cavities that I have? My teeth are sensitive to only Sugar & not hot or cold. So I have stopped adding sugar to my coffee & eating as little sugar as possible.I just noticed that my Gums have turned white around one tooth after I brushed my teeth, flossed & rinsed with mouthwash. What could it be? Inflammation? or something else? Does it look like my gums are receding or that I have periodontal Disease? I have horrible genetics for teeth. Both my Mother & Grandfather had to get all their teeth pulled when they were in their 50's. I brush & flush twice a day & gargle after each meal.I have an Appointment with my Dentist in early June to get 2 Cavities Fixed. honestdoc: When your teeth are sensitive to sugar, that indicates you have exposed dentin and or roots (receding gums).  You can consider using Sensitive Toothpastes like Sensodyne.  The dentist may suggest restoring exposed dentin but there are no absolute treatment for receding gums (I have them and I have sweet sensitivities).  Grafting, lasers, gum surgeries won't bring back the recession but they may strengthen the surrounding gums.It is hard to fully view the white gum area, but I'm suspecting hyperkeratinized  (calloused) tissue.  That is abnormal tissue in response to trauma and irritation.  Try not to brush that area too hard. madmaxnightrider: Thanks for all the good info & advice honestdoc. I have a tooth that is really sensitive to touch but doesn't hurt unless touched or brushed. What does that mean? I will probably have most of my teeth pulled in the next decade because of terrible Genes. I am sick & tired of my teeth & gums hurting all the time. I had to order Max Strength Benzocaine for the Pain. I have been taking 4 Aleves for the Pain & that helps it the best. honestdoc: Have a good visit and plan with your dentist about your pain and expectations.  I favor the least traumatic which is to manage your pain as best as possible (like people with back pain).  Extracting your teeth should be the last resort because you will lose a lot of function unless you can afford implants. madmaxnightrider: I have had 2 of my teeth extracted already because they couldn't be saved with root canals & crowns. My Insurance covers 100% on all Cavities & 100% on one crown per year. I am not sure about dental implants. Probably doesn't cover that I would imagine. I don't want to get into taking pain pills all the time. I had an addiction to them & I've been clean for 9 years now. So that's a big no no for me. Thanks for all the good advice. madmaxnightrider: I've been using pure Dr. Tichenor's lately & it really helps with the pain. You have to put up with the burning sensation but the for the pain relief you get it's well worth it."

    "dialogue": "ajayel1: Any thoughts or advice please. Was strongly advised by my dentist a number of years ago to wear a retainer/gum shield at night as I was gringing my teeth badly and causing damage. Wore through a soft one (lower) within 12 months  and was then given a harder one (upper). Noticed at start of lockdown issues with bite (top and bottom not meeting but back (wisdom) teeth grinding. Eventually went to see dentist (delayed 12 months by covid - which has made the problem worse!). Turns out retainer doesn't go right to back wisdom teeth (to avoid gagging issues) and so by biting down on retainer in my sleep, have managed to move my teeth - hence the gap when not wearing it. Dentist a bit flummaxed what to do. Currently not wearing in the hope that teeth will regain shape and reviewing in 3 months. Meantime, back to grinding and damaging my teeth. Hope is that once shape regained, can then try a full length retiner to also cover wback wisdom teeth. Anybody else experienced this/got solution?"

I would say imagine a square as my teeth, well 1/4 the lower right side went off. As i said i already got cavities over there and i got the nervs removed, so it doesn t hurt or bleed (neither that it did when it feel) but now there is an edge there which is scrapping my tongue. Should i see a dentist about this? I mean most proabably yes but it doesn t hurt or anything so i thought i may ask Dr M: Good dayI think it is important to see a dentist. More pieces can break off and then the tooth could become compromised. Based on what you said, I think it is a good idea to go see a dentist for a full consultation."

    "title": "Sensitive Teeth - I am at my wits end with my teeth!",
    "dialogue": "FreakinOut1977: I am at my wits end with my teeth!\nI recently visited my mom who is fighting cancer in South Africa and with everything going on in the world - I got stuck, not able to return to the UK as flights got cancelled etc.\nIn the time I took the opportunity to visit the dentist. The dentist is the son of a family friend. Let’s call him Leon. Leon ended up doing a lot of work to all my teeth. I should point out that I had no pain whatsoever before I visited. I knew that I needed to get to a dentist for a routine check-up and clean. It transpired that I needed a lot of work doing. Nothing major really. Small little holes, fine cracked fillings, etc. The biggest issue was probably a crown which Leon fitted bottom left. I have been told in previous years by another dentist that this would have to be done when the filling ever cracked… This was back in 2006. So fair enough this wasn’t a surprise.\nLeon did a thorough assessment of my mouth and scanned my whole jaw in 3D which we could see on screen. He could cut sections through all the areas and identify everything on screen and explain to me where the issues were. In conjunction with photos of each tooth - I could see I needed more than one appointment to sort it out. Leon replaced all silver fillings with white ones.\nWe agreed that I would make a weekly appointment or 1.5 hours and we would start in the bottom right quadrant and work our way through every quadrant and clean as we go along. The last appointment would be a polish and overall clean. Leon ended up replacing all my fillings in my mouth.\nI was happy to proceed and spending South African Rand to do all this work made a lot more sense than British Pounds!\nThis is a dentist I know and trust.\nThe work was done over approx. 4 weeks in total. Starting with the bottom right quadrant, then bottom left, (where the new crown was fitted), top left and finally top right.\nDuring my second visit I mentioned to Leon that my bottom right of my mouth is very sore when I eat. He checked my bite and made a slight adjustment. He told me not to worry as we will be doing work to the top right he would sort out the bite finally when we get to it…\nMy first appointment was the 20th January 2021. I went back weekly for each agreed appointment till the work was completed. All this time most of my teeth were very sensitive when I ate anything. But I assumed that I had a lot of work done and it needed time to settle. I mentioned it to Leon again during the third visit who then prescribed anti-inflammatory tablets, which didn’t make any difference to reduce the pain. So, I gave it more time to settle.\nI completed the last appointment. A week after I managed to fly back to the UK.\nBut the pain stayed! I made an appointment to see my local private dentist here in the UK to whom I explained the whole story and he examined my mouth. Everything looks good and the work done is to a high standard. He made me bite on a cotton sausage for every tooth. Then something harder. Cold air wasn’t sore and tapping each tooth in my mouth wasn’t sore.\nI explained that I can’t eat anything crunchy like toast, crisps, a choclate, any nuts, muesli or anything that has a slight crunch or hardness to it! This has been like this since the first visit in South Africa, January! And is extremely sore. I have no sensitivity to hot or cold.\nMy local dentist suggested we make a mouth guard seeing that my bite could have changed during all the work that was done recently. And he wanted to rule out grinding teeth at night out before making adjustments to my bite. (I am going through a very stressful time with my mom being unwell…)\nI agreed.\nWe gave this two weeks. This made the bottom right of my mouth hurt even more as I was now biting down on the mouthguard at night, which was slightly higher on the teeth... Went back to the dentist who took an X-Ray and noticed a “fracture” in my tooth bottom right. Great! Now we getting somewhere… He replaced the filling and corrected the \"fracture.\"2 weeks later and the pain is back. Slightly (very slighty) better but still hurts when I bite on the tooth eating.\nIn the meantime the top left of my mouth one tooth has started to flare up when I eat….\nSo to summarise:\nI have no pain or sensitivity to hot drinks or cold ice cream.\nEverytime I eat food I am acutely aware of sore teeth in the back of my mouth. It feels like most teeth hurts! But I guess the teeth that are inflamed makes the whole mouth hurt?\nI have managed to identify what I think the culprits are: It feels like the fillings themselves are sensitive - If I touch the filling with my nail it’s sensitive/hurts.\nWhen I work floss between the affected area/s it hurts until it passes the top part of the tooth. Then flossing is not sore between the teeth. Pulling the floss out from between my teeth hurts again.\nMy local dentist adjusted part of the high points of my bite and was better. But still hurt when I eat food.\nI am not biting down on any high points or fillings. We have checked and adjusted this a few times already.\nI am really scared for a root canal procedure and heard some really bad stories. I suspect my dentist might suggest we do a root canal as I can see he is also very confused over the symptoms…\nI have been searching loads of forums but always end up in a dead end…\nPlease if anyone can suggest something?\nI am scared of Dr Google!!!! But someone mentioned a Dental Granuloma?\nI am at my wits end! I feel I can cry everytime I have to eat. And I am so tired of soft baby food by now, three months down the line…"

    "dialogue": "CamB05: For the last 2 weeks my tongue and bottom lip have felt raw and tender. It started with a couple canker sores on my bottom lip which I thought was due to stress or food irritation. This happens fairly often to me. But, now I have a layer of white stuff under my tongue and on bottom lip. The stuff on my tongue  almost looks fuzzy and can’t be scrapped off. I have pretty bad anxiety and this isn’t helping. Is this something to be worried about? Do you know what it may be? And ideas would be appreciated. Thanks Dr M: Good dayDo you perhaps a photo of this area? Would be a lot of help CamB05: I was actually able to brush everything off the following day. Though I’m still curious what your thoughts are, if you don’t mind. I was getting worried because it had been over two weeks and nothing like this had happened to me before. \nI was stress eating this past week because of work and may have indulged in a bit too many sweets. I read that stress and excess sugar could have caused this...not sure tho. I suspect I have some food allergies (and high stress levels) because I get canker sores more often than the average person. Dr M: Good dayWhite lesions that persists for longer than 2 weeks, sometimes have to be biopsied for possible malignancy. I would suggest going to your dentist for a full consultation. He will maybe start you off with a chlorhexidine mouthrinse, antifungal treatment or corticosteriod ointment depending on the clinical presentation and then follow up. If no improvement again in 2 weeks, then a biopsy will have to be performed to determine the diagnoses."

    "title": "Three weeks wait for the procedure after antibiotics?",
    "dialogue": "ButtonApprehensive11: At the beginning of the year, I went to the dentist with a minor and fleeting dull toothache. She said that there was nothing wrong, but said that one of my other tooth (upper left second molar) needed a filling replacement (I never asked why) therefore we did so.After the procedure, the tooth was extremely sensitive to cold water (composite filling), and I complained a couple of times about it but she said to wait, as the filling was quite deep and it might take a bit longer to settle.I waited but the tooth suddenly began to give me a throbbing pain, so I booked an emergency appointment to have it looked at. The dentist present (my usual dentist wasn't working that day) said that the filling was slightly too high, which stressed the tooth to the point it got infected. He trimmed the filling and gave me antibiotics (500mg Amoxicillin for one week - three times a day) as well as booked an appointment in three weeks time (they are currently very busy) to get the filling replaced, and said that it hopefully won't hurt until then (this was a week ago, and I'm about to finish the course of the antibiotics).From my little understanding of dentistry (hence why I'm here), the antibiotics won't make the infection magically go away (just make it subside) to allow the work to be done(?). My concern is that until I can see my dentist (in three weeks), the infection will come back and cause me pain again. Am I correct to assume so? If so, would you perhaps recommend that I try to find another dentist practice who might be able to replace the filling sooner?(I have also been randomly experiencing sensitivity/pain to pressure in the tooth directly underneath it (premolar) ever since, which had a root canal treatment about five years ago, but I'm not sure if that's related - could it possibly be?)Many Thanks in advance,B Dr M: Good dayYou are right. Antibiotics is never the solution to a problem. It only masks the symptoms. Luckily it sometimes stays in your system for about 1 month. Usually antibiotics is never given for a filling that is high. If the filling caused irreversible pulpitis or nerve damage, due to a deep filling etc, then it might be that the tooth actually requires a root canal to be done. Was this discussed with you?

Dr M: Good dayWithout a photo or x-ray it is difficult to give an opinion, but it might be that you have a draining sinus from a possible abscess on one of your teeth. This can be painless and can go through periods where it comes and goes.\nWill need more info to give a better opinion. sara.b: Hi Dr M.\nThanks for replying. It came up again the other day, I tried to get a photo but didn’t really show too well. If it is a draining sinus from a possible abscess on one of my teeth would that not show on an X-ray? I’m concerned but dentist is not so how will I get it sorted?! Will a hygienist be able to help if I booked an appointment? Dr M: If you have a draining sinus, there should be some evidence of which tooth is giving you a problem. Unfortunately a hygienist won't be of much help if an abscess is the case sara.b: Thanks for replying. I really don’t know what to do. I have no other problem other than the pus, which is on the gum above top left incisors. So I am unable to give the dentist any other information and nothing is showing up on the X-ray so dentist is just saying there is nothing there. I’m surely not getting the pus for no reason so what ever it is l want it sorted before it gets worse. Getting very frustrated as do not know what to do next! Dr M: The only other option is that the puss is due to a periodontal problem i.e gum issue. Don't know when last you've had a cleaning done?\nIf your dentist can't do the cleaning, then an oral hygienist might be of some assistance. sara.b: Thank you very much for all your replies. I have booked in with hygienist but earliest they can do is beginning of Aug! She has put me on short list so may get in earlier if they have cancellations. I am concerned about waiting all that time, that whatever it is will just get worse.

Dr M: Good dayIn my experience thus far, in such a case the best option would be to extract.\nMandibular pre-molars sometimes have very complicated anatomy, with lots of accessory canals etc. This can prove difficult to treat. \nBut you are always welcome to get a second opinion from a specialist endodontist. A CBCT scan might provide some insight into why the tooth has been giving problems, and if the reason is purely endodontic failure, or perhaps a perio-endo lesion, which is due to a localized periodontal problem.\nIn such a case, I always advise my patients to keep the cost factor in mind.

And I am due an extraction of my wisdom tooth on Wednesday which was made worse by a stupid dentist who decided it was ok to fill over what she referred to as 'soft decay'. That was even though I asked her not to. I have had no end of problems with that tooth since. While at was at her surgery, which was back home in London, she told me that my teeth were all fine,that is even though I was complaining of tooth ache in the top wisdom tooth, that is above the one she filled over. Fast forward two weeks later, I arrived in Mexico and was suffering major pain with the tooth she filled over. I went to the dentist and he told me I need an extraction and there is nothing I can do to save the tooth. He also pointed out a cavity I had in the top wisdom tooth, that is the same tooth I had been complaining about two weeks earlier in the surgery in London. To cut a long story short, I had that tooth filled and he also pointed out other fillings (almagaram) that needed replacing. I had all of them replaced with composite fillings and another two I think are either being crowned or inlays because the decay under the fillings were quite large. I have since complained about the London dentist, and have gone to a solicitor. Not only this but they also fitted me a filling a year earlier which snapped taking some of my tooth and when I returned told me I needed a crown. I then waited a year for an appointment with a broken tooth and when I returned another dentist said I shouldn't have a crown and try with another filling because crowns can cause infections. My point here is that I am scared senseless of all these cavities and it has got to the point where its affecting my mental health. I can't eat and I am now self medicating because I have white spots on my front teeth which I have convinced myself is decay. I fear Re-visiting the dentist in the UK because of the problems I've had and although a friend told me to try private as its better, I just can't afford private dental care back home. I also have gum disease, again the problem wasn't diagnosed by my own dentist and was diagnosed after I visited the dentist in Spain. I really want to sort my teeth out and currently on xilotol, omega 3, magnesium, calcium and vitamin D and also oil pulling... That is along woth flossing, interdental brushes, 6-8 bottles of mouthwash per month and sensodyne toothpaste with 1426 ppm flouride. However, it feels nothing is helping and I am honestly suffering mentally. I have enquired about tooth implants in Turkey which is definitely more affordable than the UK, but I see dentists in UK warning against it on YouTube video content. I am beginning to feel suicidal with what is happening to my teeth. I am 36 almost and it has really knocked my confidence... I just feel I am going to loose my teeth and my life and career will be over. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance."

They also sometimes limit your taste.\nThen you get chrome cobalt dentures, which are more comfortable, but also more expensive. Depending on the design, they don't influence your taste as much, but are less adjustable.\nYou also get flexible type of dentures, such as valplast dentures. Monaghan21: Thanks.. Can I ask what you mean by adjustable.? I gather the Valplast type are the most expensive.? Dr M: Valplast dentures are not necessarily the most expensive.\nWhen we talk about adjustable, I mean that you can repair or add on additional components such as an additional tooth with relative ease. Acrylic dentures can easily be added onto.  With chrome cobalt dentures, you have a metal framework. The clasps can't always be adjusted and you can only add in certain cases. Monaghan21: Many thanks. MattKW: Further to Dr M: Valplast are an injected nylon that can be made with plastic clasps. Probably wouldn't be used in your case. Cannot be added to if you later lose more teeth.\nAny type of 3-tooth denture for only back teeth may not be particularly useful or comfortable. So, prob suggest you go for a cheap acrylic denture, but it may be a bit bulky. A CrCo (metal framework) would be less bulky and fit better but often in cases like yours the metalwork may be hard to design."

    "dialogue": "Himatt: Hey everyone! I’m Matt and I grind my teeth.I am 27 and was lucky to have parents who forked over the money have my teeth straighten when I was a child. Forever greatful (When I get my into a decent career, I owe them big time!)Anyway!  I take pretty good care of my teeth. Never had a cavity, but I grind my teeth.  I want to prevent damage.\nMy questions- I wear a wire retainer every night. Is this the same as a guard? Could I use a sports mouth guard if replaced frequently?\n I have slight over bite will my top incisors be affected from grinding? \nThanks! Dr M: Good dayA wire retainer is not meant to prevent grinding. Only to prevent relapse after orthodontic treatment. Although you get lots of custom over the counter mouth guards, that are advertised to assist in grinding habits, the best option would still be to go and see your dentist. He will evaluate the extent of the grinding, and then also other contributing factors such as erosion and abrasion lesions or if there is an underlying TMJ issue that is more critical.  A custom bite-plate can then be made, that is specifically designed for your teeth,that will help negate the effects of the grinding. This plate will have to be evaluated as well during your normal check-ups, since after a few years, you might grind through it, and then you will need it replaced. MattKW: OK, how do you know that you grind your teeth? are your teeth showing signs of excessive wear (any photos or Xrays)?"

    "title": "Terrible pain after 3 fillings, any help greatly appreciated",
    "dialogue": "Philo: Nice to find a place where people help others without asking for something in return. Thanks in advanceAnyhow,\nI recently had (March 25th) 3 fillings (or so I was told) done.\nI'm not entirely convinced 2 of these were necessary, so far as the possibility of remineralization is concerned. I've had this aching/throbbing pain in my jaw, teeth and gums on the side where I had three composite resin fillings done. Two were in between teeth and 1 was on top/side. This was a week ago, and it took around 1.5 hours. It seemed like a very rough procedure, and I feel perhaps much of it was not 100% necessary. I've never had such consistent oral pain. Eating makes it somewhat worse as does anything hot/cold, even moving my jaw. I have some difficulty even sleeping because it's ever present, only calming down rarely.History:\n-Went in for initial cleaning and xrays February 18th. Was told Dentist didn't have enough time to do comp check, had to schedule for a month later. The lady who cleaned my teeth I recall even saying \"You may need a root canal\" for almost no apparent reason....\n-March 25th had 3 fillings done\n-I went back 6 days after as I called and expressed concern, an xray of the fillings was taken. First was told to wait longer to see if it calms down, then was told by the dentist that there are \"air bubbles\" in one of the fillings (the one closes to the middle) and that it may need to be refilled, so I was scheduled for 3 weeks out to come in and supposedly do it (if pain persists? He wasn't really clear on this). He also very nonchalantly said (almost inferring) that I may very well need a root canal now, and that he's seen the nerves of teeth die from very tiny fillings before. I would like to avoid a root canal at all costs. When I asked him if he could point out the cavities on previous Xrays he pointed to the tooth closest to the middle (which I agree with?) then to other teeth he didn't even work on. Then on the other two he did he just vaguely put is finger over them and said they had blemishes...I cannot personally see anything that looks as though it's down to the dentin.Prior to all this I only had very minor sensitivity every now and then with hot/cold and the like (maybe once a week or less). It hadn't been very sensitive since I started taking more care of my teeth. It really wasn't too bothersome and doesn't even come close to the discomfort I am experiencing now.The work was done on 17, 18 and 19 (I believe?) The 3 back lower left (my wisdom teeth were pulled some 15 years ago, I'm 31 now)I have the Xrays:\n-First is most recent, after fillings.\n-The next set is very recent.\n-Second set is from about 1.5 years ago.General opinion would be appreciated, regarding both if there are/were cavities that NEED(ed) to be filled and/or if remineralization is/was not possible. I think that if it cannot be certain the cavity is down to the dentin, I personally would much rather do all that I can to reverse it before being drilled. Air bubbles? What is he talking about. How concerned should I be, and what do you think I should do from here? I really want to keep my teeth alive at all costs (ie. not taking out the nerves/blood supply). Were these fillings poorly done, should I allow this dentist to try and refill, or should I go to another dentist (there aren't a lot of options around here).He also said that there are 3 cavities on the upper left that need to be filled and wanted to schedule me to do those in a month +.After fillings (air bubbles??):\nXrays 1 month before fillings: honestdoc: Unfortunately any drilling on teeth can introduce sensitivities/pain.  #29 Distal cavity is marginally necessary (I have 3 cavities like it and I had been monitoring them for over 25 years).  If you had rampant cavities, I may have filled it.  Otherwise, I would have tried remineralization.  #14 Distal should be filled.  I would not fill any others.  You do have a lot of interproximal incipient cavities.  I would inquire any sugary, acidic, and or creamy beverages (lattes) you drink often and cut them out.  I would put you on 5000 ppm supplemental toothpaste like Prevident/Gel-Kam, etc for daily remineralization.

The dentist did say they wanted to do 3 in upper left as well, which I image would include #14 however after having these three filled (which I already believed to be unnecessary, and according to your assessment they were not necessary either) I am VERY reluctant about having this dentist do anymore work at all. Let alone correct what they've already done.What would you recommend I do now? I had 3 teeth filled that were seemingly unnecessary which are now causing me lots of pain/discomfort almost 2 weeks after procedure. Two of them also appear to have voids (air bubbles) in them.\nI'm upset with myself for having gone through with this, and I'm upset with this dentist for having done this and not explicitly stated potential outcomes, let alone being trigger happy with fillings and now permanently compromising the integrity of my teeth. I put my trust in someone \"responsible\" for my physiological care, and they abused that as well as my body. honestdoc: I'm so sorry, I meant #20 on LL (sorry I had different cases on my mind).  If those are my teeth, I would leave the fillings alone (air bubble and voids can happen), obtain the 5000 ppm and try remineralization and flossing regularly.  If you drink any of those high risk beverages I mentioned, drink it fast (less time it bathes around your teeth) and drink lots of water to flush it out.  In theory, you sensitivities should subside.

The to behind it were also. #14 was not, however the dentist did say that they wanted to fill the top left three as well, not just #14! No way....I've cut out 90% of sugar aside from Fruits really. And pretty much only drink water. Brushing and flossing well also.Just to confirm, you think that all of this pain/sensitivity I am experiencing will subside on its own if I just use personal care? It's been just about 2 weeks and it's not really lessened any. Both in the jaw and those three teeth themselves. Sensitive to hot/cold and pressure of any kind. Flossing in between the three teeth is quite painful as well, at the tops in between them. I chew 95% on my right now, because it's too painful on left which can be bad if prolonged as well....The three things I've been expressed to try by others have been:\n1. Attempt to fix bite (although I don't personally feel that my bite is very off)\n2. Redo one (or all?) of the fillings\n3. Root canalMy dentist wants to redo filling #20, because of the \"air bubbles.\" And even made it seem like that very well may not work, so a root canal is likely in store. I DO NOT want a root canal at all costs and this is absurd, do you concur?\nThe 5000 ppm paste should help the three teeth that were filled...?This is just terrible...dental work here (in U.S.) is SO expensive, and even if you can get some form of dental insurance they don't cover many things and still paying 50-30% is A LOT of money when your impoverished. honestdoc: If you have to redo the filling, ask the dentist to use Fuji Equia.  It's a glass-ionomer material that bonds naturally and will help desensitize the tooth.  It won't have air bubbles and it won't have polymerization shrinkage (1%).  You won't need root canal unless the pain is so intense that it wakes you up at night or you have swelling on the tooth.  You may consider going to another dentist.

Is Equia that much better?I went to a walk in clinic (as I have no other options here without $$$) had a dental student see me that eventually said they needed to do a full check and schedule for 3 weeks out (all they had). Here's what we concluded there though: #18 seems fineBoth #19 (MOD compostie) and #20 (DO composite):\nPalpation - negative\nPercussion - positive\nEndo ice - positive (lingering response)\nChecked occlusion w/ articulating paper - no visible high spots.\nTooth sleuth used to check for fractures - pain/sensibility on all cusps of both teeth.Does this help give any more idea as to what's going on? Also, would you consider these fillings to be deep?Thanks again for your help mateXrays taken there: honestdoc: Forte is the same product.  Fuji Equia Forte.  Fillings look fine for now. Philo: honestdoc said:\t\t\tForte is the same product.  Fuji Equia Forte.  Fillings look fine for now.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nThe chart notes only state the #18 was filled with Fuji Forte (because of moisture etc...), though #19 and 20 do not mention it, and those are the troublesome teeth.Yes, in observing them in those Xrays they do look \"alright.\" Interesting how different Xrays from same/similar angle can appear quite different.Do the most recent \"test\" results that I posted in previous post help to give any idea as to what is happening and what may need to be done? (aside from just looking at the Xrays themselves) (the cold test pain dissipated within 15 seconds or less, and the percussion on #19 & 20 was very minor)Another dentist said to me (regarding those results): \"A positive lingering response would mean the nerve is dying, but positive percussion muddies the water. Generally positive to percussion occurs after the nerve is dead and no long has a cold sensitivity. I wouldn’t consider those filling deep at all and am shocked that you have the lingering response on 19 AND 20. You may just be EXTREMELY unlucky. I have yet to see someone develop pulpitis in two adjacent teeth from simple fillings.\"What do you think? Should I just keep waiting this out maybe, not have any of the fillings redone and hope that the pain/sensitivity dissipates eventually (it's been a little over 2 weeks now).Also I apologies for taking your time, it really does mean a lot to me though. honestdoc: I'm very conservative and I favor the least traumatic in waiting it out.  Consider taking anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen (taken with food) to minimize pulpal inflammation and minimize exposures to colds."

    "dialogue": "Zopkios: Why hasn’t a mouthwash or the like been developed which really does remove 100% of plaque on our teeth?It is now 11 years later since Professors Dijkstra and Dijkhuizen deciphered the structure and functional mechanism of the glucansucrase enzyme which is responsible for dental plaque sticking to the teeth.So one would think that by now, regular visits to dental hygienists would be mostly unnecessary. Dr M: Good dayUnfortunately some plaque has to be removed mechanically, by means of brushing, flossing or then regular scaling and polishing. \n\" Swooshing \" around some mouthwash around in your mouth, does not reach all the areas it should, so quite often there is some plaque left over, which then become mineralized to form calculus, which can only be removed with a scaling.\nA lot of people also don't adhere to the instructions of the mouthwash i.e rinse for one minute and then spit out. Most rinse for like 20 seconds, and then spit out the mouthwash, where after they immediately rinse there mouth with water as well. This then defeats the entire purpose.\nBest way to prevent tooth decay and gum is still old fashioned brushing, with the correct techniques. MattKW: The mouth is just the beginning of the alimentary canal. To somehow remove or destroy all micro-organisms in your mouth with a mouthwash would likely either cause direct damage to your mouth and alimentary canal, or severely disrupt the biome of the alimentary canal. In your example, I wonder if preventing plaque from sticking to the teeth may just simply swap one microbial problem for another. There has also been consideration of making a vaccine to act against Strep. mutans as a way if reducing decay, but other microbes would just step into place and create other problems. Just brush and floss; mouthrinses are overhyped.

And now don't they have such kits which you can do on your own at home?  So if such a “mouthwash” could be developed, it would be applied using the same method.  Zero danger to the alimentary canal since the treatment is confined to the teeth and thereby isolated from the rest of the mouth.  And as I replied to Dr M, you have not addressed my question about the published research 11 years ago by Professors Dijkstra and Dijkhuizen.  What has happened to it? MattKW: So, I found an article they wrote. It was interesting, but why it hasn’t progressed is not clear. Maybe the cost? You’ll have to do follow-up, maybe even contact the authors. Dr M: Also found the article they wrote, and I agree, very interesting stuff. No idea why this has not been more fully publicized and discussed. Maybe cost or difficulty finding and effective inhibitor of the enzyme to add into products.\nThe authors did however also mention that they themselves believe that the age of the toothbrush is still far from gone."

    "title": "Root canal issues or TMJ / Grinding pain?",
    "dialogue": "Andrew20: 5 months ago I had 2 back molars removed due to a crack and infection. The 3rd tooth right next to these (premolar?) then had a root canal and crown. The extraction of the 2 teeth was not easy as both were attached to the jaw bone. In the last couple of weeks, the root canalled tooth is a little tender to side pressure only when pressed (not pressure at the top, no sensitivity to hot or cold or general ache) and I have a mild ache in the jaw were the 2 teeth were removed and under my ear. I've been to both my dentist and oral/maxfax suregon (but not my endodontist who did the root canal yet) and neither can see anything wrong with the root canal tooth or in the area where the teeth were removed. My oral/maxfax surgeon has diagnosed TMJ as my jaw on the opposite side pops out of place at night and sometimes locks so I cant open it fully. He thinks the pressure pain in the root canal tooth could be due to grinding my teeth and 'Im getting a mouthguard.  My question is, could the grinding be hurting the root canal tooth (the bite is fine) or is the root canal failing?  I know its hard to answer without x-rays. Dr M: Good dayGrinding could cause some pain on the tooth. Even though the tooth has had root canal treatment done, it still has ligaments around it, and if these ligaments become stretched, due to grinding, it could lead to some pain on the tooth. The occlusion should be double checked as well.\nUnfortunately it could also be a combination problem. If the root canal is indeed problematic, then this could also contribute, but without more information, it is impossible to tell. Andrew20: Thank you so much Dr M. I know I should just go back to the Endodontist as ask his advice, but Im so afraid he'll say I need more work done. I had so much done and had pain for so long last autumn, to be back here now is so upsetting  - although I have almost no pain except on flossing really and a very mild pain in jaw, my mind is going straight back to where I was and worst case senario.  My husband thinks I should wait until I get the mouth guard and see if that helps, especially as my dentist and oral surgeon think the root canal looks good. Dr M: You can always wait and see how the mouth guard works. If no relief, go and see the Endodontist again."

    "title": "Need help (#31 or #30 / root canal vs extraction vs neuralgia)",
    "dialogue": "Somuchpain: I've seen a number of dentists, endodontists and periodontists over the past month, and people haven't been able to diagnose what I should do. So I'd be interested in hearing what the dentists in this forum think of the situation. I'll provide background below, and I've included CT scans and X rays I received in this dropbox folder: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6tmnap4wxuw3aqz/AADCaflVW6OWPLexwdCSsBJaa?dl=0The pain began on Feb 23, when I began feeling occasional stabbing pain, like electric jolts, in my right and lower cheek and around my lower gum area and teeth. They would occur every few minutes and when I moved my jaw, for instance when eating or talking, and so I went to see my dentist on Feb 25. Since the pain hadn't localized to a specific tooth and X-Rays didn't show any specific issues, the dentist suspected neuralgia and sent me to an oral surgeon who I saw on Feb 26. The oral surgeon didn't believe that neuralgia was the issue and recommended that I see an endodontist. The pain intensified over that weekend and localized to my back lower gum area, with more pain on #30 than #31, but pain in the general area. At the time, I had already received a root canal on #30 about 5 years ago and had a 15-year old filling at #31. I saw 3 endodontists on March 1, and explained the pain to them and they took X Rays and CT scans, as well as tapped the tooth, did the bite-and-release, the cold test and other tests, and concluded that it wasn't clear whether either teeth needed endodontic treatment.One endodontist suspected that #31 was the tooth giving me problems but said it was inconclusive. I began taking antibiotics -- Augmentin -- on March 1, and the endodontists felt waiting to see how the antibiotics helped and how the pain developed was advisable. As the week progressed, the pain isolated more to #30, and to a lesser degree #31, and intensified. I emailed two of the endodontists on March 5 and told them that the pain seemed to be coming from #30 and since that had a root canal, they emailed back for me to see a periodontist or oral surgeon to have the tooth extracted. I saw a periodontist for a consultation on March 8 and he also advised an extraction of #30. I saw one of my prior endodontists also on March 8, and he believed it was too early to extract #30 and advised that he suspected I was feeling referred pain from #31, and he advised that I get my crown replaced on #30 (since that was needed anyways) and the dentist could see if there were any fractures or other issues with #30 when he replaced the crown, since he (nor any of the professionals) could not see any fractures with #30. I replaced the crown on March 11, and the dentist saw no fractures or issues with #30. The pain was steadily getting worse and worsened over the weekend. The pain was pulsing; when I touched my front teeth together or pressed my lip, I'd feel pain around #30/#31, and when I moved my jaw, I'd feel pain in #30/#31. On March 15, I called the endodontist who suspected #31 and decided to go forward with the root canal on #31, and he did the root canal in two phases, first cleaning out the tooth and disinfecting on March 17 and then performing the root canal on March 22. Upon opening up the tooth, he saw that the nerves were dead and there was debris, and thus the tooth did indeed need a root canal. On March 18, the pain intensified and my jaw began to swell, and the endodontist recommended antibiotics (Augmentin) which I began taking. Over the weekend, from March 19-22, the pain became very intense, with throbbing, pulsing pain on #31. By the time I arrived to the endodontist's office on March 22 for the root canal, I couldn't close my mouth and the pain was very intense, with sharp, stabbing pains in #31 every 45 seconds - indeed, following the first phase of the root canal the pain had shifted from #30 to #31.After the root canal, for a day, the pain in my teeth were gone, though the trauma to my jaw and the gums behind #31 caused pain in my jaw area, and regular spasms to my jaw. That has since dissipated. However, the tooth pain has returned, with a focus on #30. The area around #31 remains sensitive, and given the very extreme pain on March 19-22, my cheek, lower jaw, and gums behind #31 continue to have spasms and suffer pain, but that has lessened since the root canal was performed. Now, it's more pain around #30 that is continuing to grow. I feel occasional throbbing on #30; there remains tenderness around my inner cheek, gums, back gums connecting to the back of my mouth behind #31, as well as small spasms to that back gum area behind #31 when i open and close my mouth, although this could be lingering effects from the extreme pain of March 19-22; there is a lingering dull pain in #30; there is pain on #30 when I touch my two front right teeth together. I'm also constantly feeling a sharp, very painful electric jolt in the middle of my cheek, that's what kept me up at certain times at night and it's returned today after I spoke for a minute in the afternoon. I still can't eat or talk without incurring substantial pain.I'm trying to ascertain the appropriate next step, especially since the pain is getting worse and I'm concerned going into the weekend, and would welcome any thoughts you guys have. MattKW: The RCTs look fine on the single and zipped X-rays. Sorry, but I'm not going to download and install viewing software for the CBCT images. \nHowever, your pain does not seem to correlate with your current dental state as seen on those Xrays. Also, I can't even be sure that #31 was actually in need of an RCT as I only have the info that you relay. I would really need to see the endodontist's detailed notes to see why he came to that decision, and what he found when he opened up the tooth. There are too many vague signs and symptoms in your narration that limit what I can suggest for you. I would not extract either tooth unless a very clear and substantiated diagnosis was made.

Right now, it’s an occasional pulsing to the area around #30/#31, and a strained, stabbing sensation around my jaw when I try to move my jaw. Is there some sort of medication I can take to calm down the inflammation to the ligaments / nerves? What’s causing the stabbing? I can’t really talk or eat without incurring pain so should I just rest and do nothing, to see how the pain evolves? I’m just trying to figure out what I should be doing given that the evidence to extract either tooth remains inconclusive. Btw, the CBCT scans don’t seem to show any problems either, based on the conclusions of the 3 endodontists and 1 periodontist that viewed them. honestdoc: Did you have any history of trauma, stress, grinding/clenching your teeth and or viral infection?  With all the inconclusive findings, it may be referred pain from undetected source.  I'm suspecting TMJ and or possible Facial/Trigeminal Nerve branch.

It definitely feels like there's an issue with the trigeminal nerve branch (pain is triggered when I tough my lip or my front chin or when I bite my two front teeth together). But I suspect that that pain to the trigeminal nerve branch has been caused by a dental issue inflaming it. Somuchpain: I have an update I'd like to share, and would be interested in any thoughts you guys may have: It is now 14 days since the root canal, and the pain remains and most recently over the past few days has not shown much signs of abating. It’s remained relatively constant the past few days. It was getting a little incrementally better for a few days, and then for the past few days, it’s gotten a little incrementally worse, with these day-to-day changes being relatively small. From the day of the root canal on March 22 to around March 31, the pain improved, to a large degree as my jaw healed, but since then the pain has somewhat flatlined and in certain ways has gotten a bit worse. In terms of how it’s worsened, as an example, I get brief ripples of pain as described above now sometimes when I walk whereas I wasn’t experiencing that 5-6 days ago.I’ll describe the current pain. For the most part, it’s activated when I move my jaw, whether through talking, eating, or moving my tongue around. When these actions result in a ripple of pain, I basically feel a successive set of stabbing pains (maybe 4-7) in the gum / root area of 30 / 31, or somewhere along the gums of my lower jaw. The ripple of pain stabs makes me contort my mouth and, weirdly enough, lick my bottom lip – somehow, that action subconsciously seems to control the pain. This has been a feature of the pain since the original Feb 23 pain. Pain is also activated when I press my front right lip, or front right chin, or touch my two right front teeth together. I’ll feel a jolt in my lip, or a streaking pain across the right side of my face along the bottom gums, or I’ll feel the jolt of pain in my lip and in the gum / root area of 30 / 31.I feel the pain in the gums / roots area of molars 30 and 31, a little more towards 31. If I reach inside my mouth and touch the inner top of my gums behind molar 31, it’s highly sensitive and sends a ripple of pain. If I press down on my teeth with my finger, at varying times, I’ll feel pain in different teeth. On occasion, it may be my first 3 teeth, and the pain is felt in that tooth’s gum / root area. On other occasions, it’ll be when I press down on 30 and 31. But there’s always a time if I press on one of the teeth, there’s some sort of pain.The pain will vary in intensity at different points in time. The pain is a little more active after I wake up and do my first set of talking or eating breakfast, and will moderate a bit over the course of the day, and then end up being pretty active by end of the night until I stop moving my jaw and go to sleep. For the most part, if I’m not moving my jaw and just holding still, there’s not much pain. It’s more activated when I do some of the above-described actions involving moving my jaw. There does seem to be a point in the gum / root areas of 30/31 where the pain tends to be the central point. This also seems to be the same area that was suffering far more significant pain prior to the root canal, especially in the excruciating days of pain in between my first phase of the root canal (the pulpectomy) on Weds March 17, and the actual root canal on Monday March 22.I went to see an oral surgeon on March 25 after my root canal, when the pain was more severe, and when the pain was really focused on my inflamed back lower jaw following the excruciating pain of March 17-21 prior to the root canal. At that point on March 25, a few days after the root canal, I could not talk at all. The oral surgeon advised pain killers, Methylprednisolone 4 mg and waiting to see if the pain continues to decline. He mentioned that if the pain continued to decline, I could skip the Methylprednisolone, and so I never took it. I haven’t really been taking pain killers either, since the issue is less that I’m dying of pain, versus I just want to recover so I can talk, exercise and live a normal functioning life again.The pain did continue to decline but has flatlined and has stayed constant, with small variances of improving or worsening, since about March 31.  As of now, I continue to not talk or exercise (running, jumping and heavy breathing activate the pain). honestdoc: You may have TMJ dysfunction.  If you are in the US, have your medical doctor refer you to a TMJ specialist that your medical insurance may cover (it is very expensive without insurance help).  If that doesn't resolve it, consider neurology evaluation. Somuchpain: honestdoc said:\t\t\tYou may have TMJ dysfunction.  If you are in the US, have your medical doctor refer you to a TMJ specialist that your medical insurance may cover (it is very expensive without insurance help).  If that doesn't resolve it, consider neurology evaluation.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...I definitely seem to -- so much of the lingering pain is centered around the TMJ right now. When I google TMJ, google says: \"Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome is a disorder of the jaw muscles and nerves caused by injury or inflammation to the temporomandibular joint.\" Yep, that sounds about right -- the tremendous toothache (that I think I agree with my endodontist was brought about by tooth decay in #31, since the root canal seemed to dramatically cut down the pain in the tooth) has caused \"injury or inflammation\" to my trigeminal nerve and my temporomandibular joint, and both those are what seem to account for 80% of the pain now, although there still is pains in the gum and tooth around 30/31, but they seem to be lessening very little each day. What's nutty about this pain is the healing is so slow, and every few days seems to worsen, then gets a touch better, then evolves to some new form of pain -- I feel like I've felt so many different types of pains on the right side of my face over the past 6 weeks. Every few days when I draft a description of my pain, it's different than before, but still debilitating enough that I can't talk. Today, for instance, the pain is focused right at the TMJ, right at the point where my lower jaw and upper jaw meet, and it's just ongoing spasms and pain ripples focused in that area. It's almost as if once the spasms start, the muscles just get used to spasming regularly, and so it takes days for the spasms to calm down. A good night's sleep and complete rest to the muscles helps -- they get a chance to calm down and spasm a bit less the next day. I guess my concern is that there's a microfracture in one of the teeth that's triggering the ongoing pain, but it may be just that the healing process for TMJ and trigeminal nerve inflammation/injury is just real slow. I guess I'm just continuing to wait it out. You're right though, I should probably book an appointment with a TMJ specialist because by the time the appointment arrives, I'll have either gotten worse or I can just cancel it then. Thank you very much for the comments."

    "dialogue": "ManicaJay: A large portion of pallet bone was removed during a molar extraction that has left a large divot in my mouth. I was not informed that this may happen prior to extraction, nor did the dentist inform me that he had removed any bone. It wasn't until my 2 week follow up appointment with different dentist that I was told the divot was actually bone that was removed, as I assumed it was just an incision. That follow up dentist said it is \"the worst case he's ever seen\". I saw a 2nd dentist the following day and he said \"it is a very large defect\" and suggested I see an oral surgeon. Is this common practice amongst dentist to not inform their patients that bone was removed, or do I have a legal case on my hands?I also ended up getting a perforation in my sinus membrane that I never was informed could happen. Thankfully that healed on its own. honestdoc: Unfortunately, removing that molar can be very traumatic because it has 3 flared out roots including the prominent palatal root where the defect is.  Without removing bone, the roots may never come out.  I cannot comment on the lack of communication.   I communicate fully with my patients and they can still say I never said anything to them.  When a person is in pain, he/she may not fully comprehend details.  Since it was a traumatic procedure, that first dentist should have followed you up.  The 2nd dentist should never had commented like that because I guarantee you that 2nd dentist did not perform enough of those procedures.  By the way, I've seen Oral Surgeons traumatize way more than that. If a person can wait, I would usually refer molars like that to Oral Surgeons.  If they can't, I will inform them I may leave roots in to minimize further trauma.  A lot of dentists will disagree with me but I would go back in 1 month (If the person can't go to Oral Surgeon) when the bone would naturally soften around the roots making it less traumatic to remove. MattKW: Extractions don’t always go the way we’d hope, despite careful assessment. If someone reckons they could have done it better, then they’re only saying that with the benefit of hindsight. I’ve done 15000 in my career, and I still get the occasional one that is unexpectedly difficult. Sometimes the opposite happens where I feel it will be quite difficult, but then both the patient and I are pleasantly surprised by an easy extraction."

Usually this can be cleaned off.\n2) Normal discoloration due to the fact that the tooth has undergone root canal treatment and is now non vital.As long as the remaining tooth structure is sound, and there is no decay visible on the x-ray, this should not be a cause for any concern. MattKW: The blackness isn't the sign of anything harmful. However, there's no good tooth structure remaining, and a permanent crown is not feasible. You can keep going like before with some sort of temporary crown or buildup, but don't spend any big money on this tooth. be prepared to have it extracted the next time the temp crown comes off."

She has a bign jagged gap now between her front two teeth. Dr M: Good day\nFront fillings on kids are sometimes very difficult to do. They bite into things, eat sticky sweets, and all of these things sometimes cause the fillings to come loose.\nThat being said, it might be a good idea to visit a pediatric dentist in your area, that specializes in working on children. They might have alternative options or alternative filling materials that can be used, that might last longer than conventional composite materials, that area also very sensitive to certain conditions during placement, that might also influence their bonding to the teeth. Ester: Thank you for your reply. She went to a pediatric dentist for the initial treatment and the subsequent visits. After it fell out 5 times we took her to an adult dentist..any other suggestions? honestdoc: Traditional tooth colored fillings do not bond very well to baby (primary) teeth.  I like Glass Ionomers such as Fuji Equia (available in the US) which bonds better but does not have the esthetics traditional fillings provide.  Fuji Equia should have plenty of shades that can match fairly close. MattKW: Sometimes it isn't worth the effort to fill front baby teeth if they are causing no pain. These lower front teeth are usually the first to fall out at 6yo. I would be more worried to see if she has decay in the back teeth. Has she had X-rays of the back teeth?"

I use an Oral-B electric brush with soft bristled heads for 2 mins 2x a day, Pro-expert toothpaste, fluride mouthwash, floss & waterpik (though only once a month). I never touch the gums directly, other than slightly \"penetrating the gumline\" while brushing, as the NHS website says to do.I've also cut out all sugary/starchy/greasy/sticky food & drinks & don't smoke or drink alcohol.It just recently started getting painful, as there are a few super exposed areas of teeth that are really sensitive to pressure (eg from the pillow at night).Any help would be greatly appriciated.Thanks for reading honestdoc: It is true that traumatic brushing can cause irreversible damage to your gums and teeth.  I had the same problem and my dentist growing up never mentioned it until it was very damaged.  There is a difficult balance between traumatic brushing vs thorough brushing.  I find that your soft bristled toothbrush or brush head needs to look like new and not be flattened or bent when it is replaced after 3 to 4 months.  If it doesn't look like new bristles, you are causing damage.   I told my mother she was brushing too hard (she taught me to brush when I was young) and she continued to flatten her toothbrush in less than a week and her gums receded near the root tips.  We grafted her gums and it promptly failed.The receding gums and teeth abrasions are permanent and will never grow back.  If you have sensitive teeth, you can try sensitive toothpaste with Potassium Salts to block the sensitive dentinal tubules.  You won't feel immediate relief because it takes a few weeks to work. Danmcmahon: Hi honestdoc & thanks for your reply.I use \"sensi ultrathin\" brush heads and swap them every 3 months, or when the blue tip fades to white. There isn't any noticeable flattening when swapping them out, which is why I find the continuing recession is so baffling. I know people who are much older & brush much harder, yet they have way better gums, go figure! The gum I still have is surprisingly healthy, no inflammation, bleeding or gingivitis, it's like there's some other mysterious force causing it.One dentist suggested acid reflux, or the effect of braces pulling teeth forward & out of the gumline, though taking antacids doesn't seem to have slowed it down, and I had braces over 5 years ago. I do also have a wisdom tooth pointed sideways into the other teeth, which I've wondered if that could be pushing them.Sorry to hear about your Mother's gum graft, I've stumbled on a lot of \"gum graft horror stories\" today & hope to avoid it like the plague, unless absolutely necessary.I'll look into sensitive paste with potassium salts, the Pro-expert toothpaste offers some protection, but not enough for the worse bits.That said, I could definitely live with it as is now, the fear is that it'll keep getting worse until things like gum grafts & extractions are inevitable, which is a pretty scary thought at age 22.Until then, thanks again for your help & stay safe."

This started a few weeks ago with some severe nighttime biting; however, it is still a problem.  I'm wondering if this will go down on its own, calm down, or if some topical treatment may help.

For the past year I've been brushing my teeth 0-1 times a day and eating ~1000 calories a day because of really bad mental health issues, and so my oral hygiene is extremely poor right now. However, I'm not in a very stable financial position, so I don't want to go to the dentist unless it's really necessary. I was hoping to gain some insight as to what might be going on and what I should do about it.Here's a picture of what it looks like: I apologize in advance; I know my mouth and teeth look very, very gross. I'm trying to get better at taking care of my teeth but I'm worried that it's already too late.Some other details that may be relevant are that:\n1. My cheeks and inner lips peel when I wake up and sometimes just randomly throughout the day. This has been going on for a few months.\n2. I have bad breath even after doing proper brushing, flossing, and mouthwash rinsing. This has been the case for many years, not just this past year.\n3. My tongue has always had lots of white stuff (I'm assuming it's bacteria) on it, no matter how much I've scrubbed at it.\n4. I may have a mild allergic reaction to something that's common in a lot of foods (my best guess is a type of processed sugar), and so after eating almost any type of food I will get lots of mucus buildup in my throat and at the back of my mouth.\n5. I have had acid reflux since I was a kid. For a few years it got to the point where I would throw up in my mouth multiple times a day, but fortunately that isn't often the case anymore. When this happened as a kid, I would not rinse my mouth with water afterwards.\n6. I have been on a medication that causes dry mouth for around 5 months now.\n7. I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I'm not totally sure if that's relevant but I'm including it just in case.I also wanted to ask: I recently bought 3% hydrogen peroxide to use to whiten my teeth. I'm worried now though that it may make whatever is happening with my gums worse. Should I still use it or no? Dr M: Good dayFirstly it is never too late to start looking after your teeth. I would hold off with the tooth whitening for now, until some of the other issues are sorted out first.\nThe white coating on your tongue, might be because of the medication you are on. Dry mouth can lead to all sorts of fungal infections taking hold, and it is therefore wise to drink a lot of water, and chew sugar-free gum, in order to stimulate salivary flow. Saliva is the natural cleanser of the mouth. If the white area persists, it might be that you have an underlying fungal infection already, and for this you would need anti-fungal treatments. But it is best to visit your dentist, so that this can be evaluated clinically.Bad breath could be associated with the acid reflux. I would visit a medical doctor for this issue. They need to investigate the cause of the acid reflux, and then treat it accordingly. Continuous acid reflux, can lead to severe dental erosion, which in turn leads to yellow teeth, due to enamel loss, and sensitivity.Furthermore, brushing 0-1 times a day is not enough. Poor oral hygiene habits lead to plaque build up, caries formation and gum infections, that can be appear to be more painful in certain areas. The fact that you suffer from dry mouth, worsens this. If left untreated, this could lead to a condition called periodontitis, which might end up in tooth loss.\nI think it is a good idea to go see your dentist, for a full evaluation, so that all the issues can be addressed and a treatment plan can be set in place.It is never too late to start taking your oral health seriously. elricwizard: Dr M said:\t\t\tGood dayFirstly it is never too late to start looking after your teeth.

It's only randomly and not consistent.Is this normal - even after 2 weeks? Does it mean theres a leak somewhereThanks for all your replies. honestdoc: No, it is not good that you taste anything from that tooth.  Most likely the dentist placed a temporary filling and it is leaking.  That is not good because the root canal must have a sterile environment or it can get reinfected.  Have it looked at ASAP."

    "dialogue": "an innocent man: Hi\nFirst of all I have to admit to not having any dental treatment for over 20 years. I am trying to overcome this  phobia and part of this is about getting fillings. \nI last went to a dentist 2 years ago where I was told I needed eight filings. Apart from my massive fear of having all this work done, I am seriously worried as to how effective fillings are.\nEveryone I know who has had fillings has said that they broke/came out/ had to be re-done/ caused a lot of pain afterwards. \nThe dentist I saw two years ago was unable to give me much assurance that the fillings would not fall out. He would only say they should not fall out!So I don't want to get a lot of fillings and then have to keep returning to the dentist year after year to get them re-done etc. Can  anyone provide me with any truthful reassurance on this or will getting fillings lead to a terrible dependence on going to a dentist over and over to get my fillings replaced (something, frankly, I could not face).Many thanksCiaran honestdoc: I'm very big on prevention.  It is best not to get any cavities.  If you have cavities, then you need fillings.  Fillings will never be as good as natural teeth (no fillings).  If you have cavities, you can't let it go.  If so, then the cavities will get bigger until you teeth break off or you get pain and swelling.  Sorry, we don't have a magic wand.  1.  Don't get cavities.  2.  If you get cavities, the smaller the cavity (filling), the better."

    "dialogue": "John Foster: Hello all;This is my first post. I am 59 years old, I have naturally soft teeth that are prone to decay and breakage, also I am a terrible clencher and do a lot of damage to my teeth.  I am currently scheduled to have all my remaining bottom teeth extracted, and will be receiving a temporary full bottom denture, which will be replaced by a permanent denture +/- 6 months. I will also be having my all top teeth extracted EXCEPT for a couple of molars on each side. these molars are not pristine, but they are serviceable. I will be having a temporary partial top denture installed, followed by a permanent one. Both my dentist and denturist strongly recommend retaining these molars to better secure the top plate. My closest friend tells me that the best thing he ever did was to get rid of the last few natural teeth on the top and go for a full top plate. My wife thinks that since most people have so few problems with with their top plates, that to keep some natural teeth will result in ongoing dental costs as well as ultimate top plate modification or replacement. This is a tough decision, once teeth are out they can't be put back in, on the other hand, I don't want to spend money unnecessarily on replacing or modifying my top plate.ThanksJohn Dr M: Good dayDo you perhaps have a xray of the remaining top teeth, so that we can evaluate their condition and give an opinion?"

I had a lot of health problems for a while and was vomiting often for a few years. I also wasn’t taking the best care of my teeth. If I were to go to the dentist, how would they fix this?

    "dialogue": "Jacobd: First let me explain a few things, so I'm not very normal I guess you could say. I was born with teeth first off, I didn't keep them very long because I needed room for my normally baby teeth but that's a thing. Also my teeth as a baby had little to no enamel when they emerged from the gums and the same goes for my adult teeth and I think I still have a baby tooth or two at the age of 21. I also grind my teeth A LOT while I sleep and clench my teeth when I'm stressed or concentrating really hard. I have tried several kinds of mouth guards and I either shred it and swallow pieces of it or spit it out while asleep and grind my teeth. On several teeth it's missing so much you can see the root pocket through the top of the tooth.\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nIf you have any ideas on how to fix or stop this stuff that'd be cool.So now for the whole reason I came here. I noticed my tooth had a cavity when a piece of the tooth broke off from using a wooden tooth pick. It doesn't hurt at all unless I poke deep inside of the tooth with a tooth pick. It has a dark spot close to the gums that looks like it's inside the tooth but showing through the dentin if that's possible. This tooth had a cavity about a year ago and I had it filled but I'm thinking now after seeing it that it was never cleaned and was just sealed shut. Here's a picture, can't really get any better pictures because it's hard to focus the camera on something In my mouth. My new health care does not provide dental coverage so I tend to wait till it's life threatening or just let it take its course if not threatening. But I've heard that an infection of the root can spread to the jaw and if that goes on to long you may need a bone graft and that sounds like a lot more money and it sounds painful. I want to try to have a filling or root canal procedure but I don't know if that'll be possible, I just really don't want an extraction. Dr M: Good dayIt does look like you have a cavity on the affected tooth. With an x-ray, we can see a little bit more of how the tooth structure is looking on the inside of the tooth. Unfortunately, the longer you wait, the less likely it is to fix the tooth, and the more likely it can become that an extraction will be the only option.\nMake some time to see a dentist."

    "dialogue": "okayokay: I went for a tooth cleaning in early January. I had tartar on the gum line, where my molars are. It was way up there and annoying to remove. It hurt. It was like the assistant was digging severely into my gums.On January 18, days later, I see this bump where the tartar used to be. I showed the dentist and he said he doesn’t see anything. How could he not? Anyway, I believe the gum was traumatized because of the cleaning.It is now February 5th, and it hasn’t gone away. It was flattening at one point, not it looks like it did when I first noticed it.It doesn’t hurt or anything. Dr M: Good dayIt is difficult to see the bump on the photo provided. I can see however that you have some dark triangles in between your teeth. This can be caused by excessive \"tartar\" or calculus being in that area for a prolonged period of time. Without proper cleaning, this leads to gum recession as well as interproximal bone loss, leading to these dark triangles. It is important that you go for regular check-ups every 6 months okayokay: Hello! Thanks for the reply. Sorry for the confusion. The dark triangle, if you zoom in, is the bump I am referring to. okayokay: In this new photo, you can see that at one point it was flattening. As though it was healing. But now, like in the first photo I posted, it looks bubbly again. okayokay: I do hope someone out there can help me out. Again, the dark triangle in between the teeth, is the bump I am referring to. Please, zoom in the first photo, and you’ll see what I mean. Dr M: I think it is best that you go back to your dentist, so that a full periodontal examination can be done, to rule out gum disease.

Like white deposit at the base of teeth. I didn't go for cleaning last year since I have jaw and neck pain.  I can't open the mouth wider for long time. So I didn't go for cleaning.  Will these deposits cause any gum issue? Dr M: Yes.\nThose deposits can lead to gum disease. It is called calculus and needs to be professionally removed. Part of the periodontal examination includes full mouth x-rays to evaluate bone levels around teeth, as well as a periodontal probing, to see if there is any attachment loss of gum tissue surrounding the teeth."

    "title": "Sensitivity after a very recent filling , never happened before ?",
    "dialogue": "Alexinmiddleofnowhere: Exactly one month ago , I got a filling on a molar \nEver since I got it , the filling felt sensitive but after 2 weeks it reached peak sensitivity , meaning I couldn’t eat on that tooth , I couldn’t chew , I couldn’t drink very cold drinks,  ecc so I immediately went back to the dentist - TWICE! She did an X Ray to check , she checked my filling she said everything was alright , she asked me if the pain was persistent , if I had it all the time but I replied it only happens when I chew . She concluded it needs more healing . Is this possible ? It’s never happened before and I got tons of fillings . I’m sort of concerned . It seems like it’s slightly better but it hasn’t gone away ?\nCrumbs and small pieces of food make it more sensitive . Do you think it needs a root canal ? Should I go ahead and get one ( I could afford it) is it worth it in my situation or ... do I just wait and see if the sensitivity goes away ?Also this tooth had some complications during the filling process when the dentist started drilling on my tooth the anesthesia hadn’t quite kicked in yet (never happened before ) and she drilled with me feeling all the pain .it was very painful . I had to stop her and She had to give me 4 more injections . I wonder if that could be the reason why it feels super sensitive now .like if that irritated it inside or something . Any help is greatly appreciated Dr M: Good dayThere could be a lot of reasons for the sensitivity. Firstly, if the filling was very deep and close to the nerve, it could've caused pulpitis. Eventually this could lead to root canal treatment.\nIf the filling is a bit too \" high \" , the occlusal interference could cause pain. It is important that the occlusion is checked after every filling, to minimize interference.\nIf a composite resin filling was placed, and there was moisture contamination during the process, it could also cause post-operative sensitivity and in such a case the filling might need to be re-done.\nHas the dentist tried to adjust the occlusion on the filling? \nHave you tried going on a short course of anti-inflammatory meds? Alexinmiddleofnowhere: Yes so , it was a bit too high but it was adjusted . She hasn’t tried to re do it completely just smoothed it out . The meds won’t do anything because it’s not a constant pain ... I only feel it for about 2-3 seconds if I bite something down with the tooth . dentist is pretty confident my tooth is fine and she doesn’t  need to redo the whole thing\nI’m not sure what to do\nAlso from the X ray the filling wasn’t super deep and it wasn’t close to the nerve - it was medium I would say . I do have a filling that coveres the entire tooth and it was a try to save me from a root canal and it never gave me a problem. It’s always the same dentist who filled all the teeth Dr M: There might also be a crack on the tooth. Usually a crack is symptomatic as you apply pressure to the tooth, and then disappears as pressure is released.\nIf your dentist has access to a CBCT scan, this could help to determine if a crack is there, since it gives a 3-D image of the tooth. Alexinmiddleofnowhere: Dr M said:\t\t\tThere might also be a crack on the tooth.

Cuz I’ve been told that and it kinda made me not want to get it anymore Dr M: A root canal might not even be possible if there is a crack that goes deep, through the pulpal floor and into the roots. I think it is best that she refers you for a CBCT and then, if she is a endodontist, she can determine if a root canal is a viable option. Most of the time root canals can save the tooth for a long period of time. Failure of a root canal is determined by a lot of factors, including operator technique and experience, if the root is short filled or not, if the tooth was crowned to prevent fracture etc. \nThe truth is, that a root canal can be a good option, but it is necessary to determine the presence of a possible crack first. If there is a crack, and it is a deep crack, then maybe extraction with implant placement might be a better long term option Alexinmiddleofnowhere: Dr M said:\t\t\tA root canal might not even be possible if there is a crack that goes deep, through the pulpal floor and into the roots.

    "title": "When a crown can’t be fitted",
    "dialogue": "Islandhopper: Hi, I have three molars which are root filled (but not crowned). I was recently referred to an endodontist by my new dentist, as two of the root filled teeth showed signs of infection (dark areas around root tip on x-ray) and one in particular (LR6) had recently given me some bother (tenderness under the jaw). The other one (LL7) we agreed to take out, as there is doubt as to the restorability of it , as the filling extends below the level of the gum (also, having a root filling re-done is very expensive).As LR6 also has a rather large filling on it, there is question mark on the restorability of it as well but also, the roots have some calcification-though I guess the benefit of visiting an endodontist is that they are highly specialised & have the appropriate tools & jigs.My question is, do I have to have a crown fitted ? I understand the benefits and that they strengthen the tooth, but it seems it’s not always possible to fit one.The original filling I have on this tooth is 23years old. Couldn’t i just have another filling fitted after the tooth has been re-root filled ?Currently, I have a large metal filling, which is the top part of the tooth, and none of the original tooth is visible.My regular dentists has mentioned about lowering the gum level (which I’ve never heard off or am keen on) in order to fit a crown, but on my recent visit, he cleaned and polished the tooth and said there was some of the tooth and they might be able to do something (ie fit a crown)I’m a bit confused. If I can’t have a crown, can’t I just have a big filling (like I have currently) which has previously served me well.Thanks,\nIslandhopper Dr M: Good dayOnce a tooth has been root canal treated,  it becomes brittle over time due to a lack of blood vessels etc. A large filling is also never as strong as normal tooth structure, and once a tooth has been re-treated, it might be a good idea to crown the tooth, to prevent any fracture.\nThat being said-because this tooth has a history of a failed RCT first time round, I would consider delaying crown treatment until the re-treatment has shown some signs of success. A crown is very expensive.\nIf the access cavity is small enough, a new filling can be done at the end, and if the occlusion is adjusted so that the filling is not \" in the bite \", it might last you a long while.

    "title": "#2 Tooth removal or Root Canal???",
    "dialogue": "FosterR143: I need a root canal on my #2 tooth. In case I got that wrong, it’s the tooth on the upper right side next to the wisdom tooth. I have been having pain there for a long time and last year had that upper right wisdom tooth pulled hoping that was the issue. Wasn’t very long after the pain continued and this time I was told the #2 needed a root canal. My question is, I have been told I don’t need that tooth. But I don’t want to lose it if I don’t have to. The only reason I have not had a root canal done is financial. I can have the tooth pulled for $20.00 or pay over $1000.00+ for the root canal. The Endodontics Dr. told me when people have teeth replaced, the back 2 teeth are not replaced on each side so I shouldn’t miss it. Curious if anybody has had this tooth removed, either side upper or lower, and if you noticed it being gone.Thanks honestdoc: I understand the finances can impact your decision making.  Keep in mind after the root canal, the tooth will also need a crown.  If you live near a teaching facility like the dental school, you can consider having a referral to graduate endodontics dept for root canal and have the school place the crown.   Since teeth erupt until they are opposed,  any unopposing bottom teeth  can continue to erupt if #2 is extracted.  If all options and consequences are considered, extraction of #2 would make most financial sense. FosterR143: Thanks for your advice.  I am aware I will need a crown.  I don't have access to a dental school locally but that is a good idea and I will look into that.  It's my understanding, having the upper pulled with an opposing tooth still below is better than an upper without the bottom.   Thanks again for taking time to reply, extraction is looking like the best option. honestdoc: Sometimes when you pull #2, the bottom opposing tooth will oppose to the back side of #3 and not hyper-erupt.  From my observations, it takes about 5 years of shifting (not having any other teeth pulled or restored during this time) to see where they'll likely end up."

    "dialogue": "Lacredita: I apologize for pestering people with this question. I have tried messaging those who make fangs for a living but havent gotten anyone friendly enough to talk to me muchless share their secrets.Ive watched hundreds of dental videos from professional dentists on youtube, read dozens of articles, and have come to the conclusion of using luxatemp to make fangs. I've been using it so far with decent results but my real goal is to make full upper removable veneers instead of caps, sort of like a denture/veneer. I've learned to use dental plaster, shake tables, wax ups, dental putty that hardens into a rigid yet somewhat pliable mold and a dental drill for shaping and filing. The problem is I can't make a fully functional upper even painting the luxatemp on a casting with a silicone brush in fairly thick layers (I even tried to use a UV cure composite as a base layer.) What can I use to make an upper similar to a snap on smile design? Something thin yet very strong. Dental acrylic as a pourable medium has been horrible which is why I resorted to luxatemp in the first place. Should I resort to learning how to work with porcelain with a metal backing? I've always been interested in this for some reason and I've finally picked up a second job so I could afford the materials. I'm willing to learn/experiment with any materials. Any help anyone can provide is greatly appreciated and I thank you for your time and ideas."

We guess the most likely lesion to the least.  You can provide helpful information like any new medications around that time, relevant medical conditions, trauma, tobacco use, etc.  I believe the most common would be traumatic fibroma.

I strongly recommend you quit tobacco use (easier said than done).  I think your top dentures may be irritating and traumatizing that area so have your dentist adjust it to eliminate that effect.  Lastly, have it removed (biopsy) to rule out anything sinister."

    "dialogue": "mrjohnson: Hi, I am a dentist who recently graduated.last week there was a patient and he had pain in the lower jaw. On pressure of the 3rd lower molar (by biting), the pain relieved.Upon examination, the third molar was inclined towards the 2nd molar and there appeared to be caries on the xray distally from the second molar.\nI wanted to extract the third molar and restore the second molar, but because it was inclined and hooked under the 2nd molar, I sliced the third molar mesially to extract the third molar without pulling the second molar out.However the pain got worse even though the mandibular block was good.the upper third molar had a huge cavity and was almost gone, there was also a radiolucency apically from the upper third molar.\nhis entire face was hurting on this side, the pain was radiating from his lower jaw to the temporal muscle.I did not know where the pain came from and started to doubt myself, so I aborted the procedure and referred him to a specialist.I suspected a sinusitis because of the atypical symptoms.\nWhat could it have been and did I do the right thing? honestdoc: When patients have pain, it can be difficult to find the source since it can be referred (from a different source if the x-rays do not clearly show).  I like to start palpation and percussion on teeth slightly outside the suspected area and work into the suspect area.  You may have to do cold tests with a cotton ball (not a Q-tip since it will not get cold enough and will get a false negative).  If the pain is from the upper posteriors, I have the patient bend forward to knee level to rule out sinus pain.  Last resort is to anesthetize the suspect tooth.  Many times if all the teeth look normal and they all have symptoms, patients may be grinding and or clenching.  That can be remedied by Over-the-counter night guard or even better with a custom occlusal guard (more expensive).When you are taking out the lower 3rd molar, it is very difficult at times to achieve profound anesthesia.  I usually give the mandibular block and Gow Gates (aim for the ear hole), wait until all the pain is gone and give supplemental lingual & buccal infiltration to anesthetize possible mylohyoid and Buccal nerve branches.  I usually refer lower 3rd molars because the whole process takes longer and can get potential complications.  Upper 3rds usually comes out with minimal trauma. mrjohnson: thank you man, it was really difficult to diagnose.\nthe patient called again today, still in pain, and I referred him to a colleague of mine, I hope he is fine now.\nI feel lots of guilt for being such a retard. honestdoc: We've all been there.  I still have cases where it's harder than I thought.  My view of dentistry is how do you achieve the desired results with the least amount of trauma?

He tried several times to readjust it with his tools, and I had to go back to him several times as the denture continued to hurt my mouth. \n    After all of this, he drilled my teeth several times to try to make my teeth fit the denture. After several more visits, and more drilling of my teeth, he never was able to correct things, and I now have no denture, and my previous denture which was getting old no longer fits my mouth because he altered the dimension of several of my teeth.\n     Is it acceptable to drill a patient's natural teeth to fit the teeth to the ill-fitting denture? \n     Thank you for your opinions. If you are a dentist or denturist, please include that information in your response. Much appreciated! honestdoc: When fabricating a metal frame partial denture, it is customary to lightly prep (drill) teeth for guide planes and metal rests on teeth for stable fittings before final impressions (moldings).  It is unusual to drill teeth after fabrication.  Since I am not familiar with your case, I cannot fully speak about the reasons for drilling.  I don't like metal frames unless you are a heavy grinder and clencher and if you don't have adequate vertical space.  I prefer flexi gum colored (pink) frames which may be more accommodating."

My gums always feel sore and I feel a dull pressure in my upper teeth especially the top front teeth. Sometimes it feels like my upper top front teeth are clicking or moving even though it doesn't appear to be loose. This bothers me because I haven't experienced something like this before. When I brush my teeth it bleeds a bit near one of the canines on the left but I thought this was due to brushing a little too hard but I tried brushing gently and it still bleed a bit but not a lot. I've had gum and teeth problems for the past 9 months and it comes and goes constantly. From the pictures I've posted, do my gums look healthy or do they look like I have gum disease? Is it necessary for me to contact my dentist and let them know what's going on? I've phoned them before and they told me to leave it for a few days to see if it gets worse but it usually goes within a few days to a week. I am using corsdodl mint mouthwash to help with my gums and I also use salt rinse mouthwash. The last time I been to the dentist was January 2020. I've had two dental check up appointments cancelled due to Covid 19. My teeth are definitely due for a dental clean. I have problems with my jaw sometimes and sometimes I struggle to open my mouth to yawn or eat because my jaw would lock or be really stiff. My wisdom teeth have not fully grown and could possibly be impacted and cause the other teeth to push eachother. I've also noticed that behind my bottom front teeth it looks brownish and white and I try to clean it but it doesn't come off. The top front canine teeth on the right discoloured but I believe it's due to using corsdodl mouthwash in the past and I have been using whitening products lately and the stain seems to have improved a bit. I was a light smoker but have recently given up due to worrying about my teeth and gums. Roof of my mouth feels sore but there's no lesions. I have a slight stuffy nose and wondering whether I have a sinus infection that is causing these teeth problems or not? I really would appreciate some advice on what to do so I can stop worrying about it and get on with my daily life stuff.Thank youOlivia"

All is well... until I go to pay my copay and am told that the work (extraction + grafting) isn't periodontal in nature and that, due to that, they would have to charge me full price for the treatment. I looked at my insurance coverage and found out that if the work is periodontal in nature, they cover all the costs, if it's a simple extraction and grafting, they do not.

I've been getting bad headaches on the same side and think the 2 might be related so I just thought, best get it removed as there's no point it being there really as it isn't a working tooth anymore and see if the headaches stop.My question is, the tooth isn't loose so I'm wondering (without having the whole tooth there to pull now) how would the tooth be extracted?

Anyway, if so, could that procedure be done under local anaesthetic or would it require to be put to sleep (which was an option my dentist suggested about a year odd ago).Thanks. Dr M: Good day,\nEven if the tooth requires a surgical extraction, it can take place in chair by an experienced dentist under local anaesthesic.\nDepending on the severity of the fracture, the tooth might need to be split with a surgical drill.

Now I'm getting a bit of aching in it.

I really need this tooth out though pronto.Would people just advise I take the antibiotics anyway? I shall ring them back up tomorrow.

It looks like I might have just bit it and it's healing, but I can't tell. I'm going to see if my ENT will see me after the holidays, but until then, can anyone chime in whether this looks more like healing skin or leukoplakia recurring?If I didn't directly shine light on it, it doesn't pop out as white like my previous leukoplakia did. It also feels smooth/like the skin around it, nothing raised or rough.The pictures aren't the best. It's a difficult area to photograph.Thanks for any help! honestdoc: Could you provide August images?  It looks like hyperkeratinized tissue in a high risk area.  Definitely check in with your ENT. MR505: I don't have those anymore unfortunately. Back in August, it truly looked white (even without a light shining directly on it) and was visible above the skin. Is there any chance it's just healing tissue from a bite? I ask because there appears to be a minor indentation similar to what I've seen in past bites, but given everything that happened, I'm more paranoid now.I have my follow up scheduled for end of February but will try to get in sooner. MattKW: Leukoplakia is a broad term that is not a disease on its own; it's more a description simply meaning \"white plaque\". They are nearly always non-cancerous unless they start showing speckles of redness. Did your ENT biopsy it? MR505: Yes - the original leukoplakia that was removed had epithelial dysplasia. The oral surgeon was quite surprised it came back as anything and then referred me to the ENT who removed the rest using CO2 laser with clear margins in August. honestdoc: MR505 said:\t\t\tYes - the original leukoplakia that was removed had epithelial dysplasia. The oral surgeon was quite surprised it came back as anything and then referred me to the ENT who removed the rest using CO2 laser with clear margins in August.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nEpithelial dysplasia (hyperkeratinized tissue) is precancer (not metastatic yet).  It can be caused by constant irritation in your case possibly physical (rubbing on something rough/sharp).  The mouth does not like constant irritation and will make abnormal (dysplasia) tissue to protect itself.  Have your dentist examine where the sharp/rough spots are around the area and smooth/polish it down.  Avoid any alcohol, tobacco, mouth rinses and/or anything to chemically irritate it. MR505: Thanks. I've never been a smoker/ user of tobacco products and only a light drinker, quite young too (33). I'll have by ENT examine the area further.Just wondering how certain you are that this looks like hyperkeratosis vs. healing skin/tongue bite? If it's hyperkeratanized, should I be able to feel it?Definitely not thrilled if it's coming back, especially given it wasn't there ~2 months ago at my follow up. honestdoc: We can't tell.  I suspect that side of the tongue has been desensitized.  Have your dentist check for any rough/sharp areas and smooth/polish it. MR505: Will do! My molar looks like it may be a bit sharp and it roughly lines up where that white patch is, so maybe that's it. Hopefully it's just that or healing and nothing more sinister.Happy holidays and Thank you!"

Sometimes if you have a wisdom tooth that is only partially erupted, the gum around the tooth can get swollen and inflamed and cause what we refer to as pericoronitis.

Could this be a reason for the pain? It’s very difficult to take a good image of that tooth but I have attached the best one I could take , it is very blurry but can see the dark/ grey area. I feel like this sensitivity to cold liquids/ air is slowly turning to a toothache. Does the grey area mean that there is something going on underneath the filling? That the filling haven’t bonded properly with the tooth and bacteria gone in ? Any help would be much appreciated before I ring them back ( I don’t think I want to wait another 2 weeks as I worry I will be left with toothache over Xmas) many thanks honestdoc: I'm not a fan of composite fillings for wisdom teeth because it is hard to isolate the bonding from contamination.  I prefer modern glass ionomer restorations like Fuji Equia (US market, not sure about UK) that will bond naturally to dentin and help desensitize the nerve.  I believe you may have 3 options. 1) have the dentist redo the filling.  2) root canal which will have very difficult access, 3) extract.  Make sure you don't have any sinus problems such as tooth pain when you bend forward or walk up & downstairs.

I'm not a fan of posterior composites.  Modern composites shrink about 1% when the dentist light cures it (polymerization shrinkage).  That means there will be a microscopic gap for contamination.  On x-ray there may be a black line around the composite.  We won't know if the black line is pooling of extra bond, gap, or cavity.  Modern bonding agents are radiopaque showing up white on x-ray now.  I prefer the above material Fuji Equia.  Glass ionomer naturally bonds to dentin.  It also desensitizes the nerve in the root canal.  I always tell my filling patients to expect cold sensitivity and not to overwhelm it with anything too cold.  Newer filling materials are bioactive like Activa but I haven't worked with it yet (I don't own my clinic so I'm not able to try a lot of things until they go mainstream)."

You had experience with tooth pain before so this hopefully this gets resolved.  I prefer implants over bridges because good adjacent teeth gets drilled (prepped) to hold the bridge.  I've seen bridges fail and you can lose those adjacent teeth as well.  Implants are very expensive but it does not involve any other teeth.  They can fail too so it is best to find an experienced team of restorative dentist and surgeon. Peter2019: So I have been fine for 12 days now since I went to see the dentist. Yesterday I was eating peanuts and experienced the most excruciating pain that I have ever experienced in that tooth that I went to see the dentist about.

To make matters even worse, we just went into a 30 day pandemic lock down, where I live in Ontario, Canada. honestdoc: Don't chew on the tooth.  Have the dentist evaluate it (perio probe, tooth sleuth adjacent non-crowned teeth) after the lock down.  Make sure you are not experiencing swelling.

Im relieved that the one that the root canal was done is ok BUT now I worry about the wisdom tooth. I have asked if this tooth need root canal too he said no and that it’s probably just sensitive after the filling was done. The filling on this tooth was done 9 weeks ago, is it common to experience sensitivity so long after a filling? I had many fillings in my life and never experienced that before. He gave me some kind of special toothpaste and said the sensitivity should go within couple of weeks. I was hopeful but I feel like the pain is getting worse , more sensitive not just to cold drinks but also when I eat or just touch this tooth with my tongue. I have noticed that this tooth that had the white composite filling have a grey area in one corner ... could this be the cause of the pain? I know it’s hard to tell from this image but I’m guessing that’s micro-leakage, should new filling with micro-leakage be replaced straight away especially if it’s causing pain? It is very difficult to take a picture, I have attached one anyway but it is very blurred, any thoughts would be much appreciated"

That being said, the radiopacities are fairly symmetric and borders appear distinct (well defined) indicating slow growth.  Usually radiopacities are not as sinister in the jaw bone.  Since the x-ray is only 2 and not 3 dimensional, there is a remote possibility that the submandibular lymph node may be calcified.

Dr M: It sounds like you are referring to another Panoramic x-ray. It might be that he doesn't agree with the quality of the one you supplied and just wants a new one. The radiation emitted is the same you previously experienced. Modern digital radio-graphs emit low dosages of harmful radiation. A lot less than a few decades ago. honestdoc: Dr. M is correct.  Dental companies stopped supporting film based x-rays years ago.  Film x-rays need more radiation to expose the silver particles to reveal the image.  Digital require very minimal radiation to produce better quality images.  As in everything in health care, the doctor and patient must weigh the risk of radiation exposure to the benefits of accurate diagnosis."

I then visited a dentist recently to have a molar tooth extracted I hoped this would get rid of the brain fog however it didn't. The dentist also noticed the gum around my lower right impacted wisdom tooth was red and it felt sore to touch and my lower left impacted wisdom tooth was showing signs of decay. They are referring me to a hospital for possible extraction of the wisdom teeth. Do you think the teeth are the cause for the brain fog? The teeth themself are not to painful besides the gum around one of them. Thanks Dr M: Good dayThe change in vision is very strange. Impacted wisdom teeth can cause headaches and sometimes earache, but I would advise seeing a medical doctor about the \" brain fog \" and change in vision, to rule out poor eye sight ( which can cause headaches and blurry vision ) and other neurological possibilities."

The pain I feel is a general soreness pain like when you have a sore gum and you poke at it not a throbbing pain Dr M: Good dayThe pain that you are experiencing is normal since the tooth was only removed yesterday. A dry socket usually appears after about 3-5 days after an extraction. It is accompanied with a bad taste or smell and severe pain. If it suddenly becomes very painful, then go back and see your dentist. Emmab: Thank you for replying Do you think the black that is level with my gum is the blood clot?

I have not taken any pain medication as I don't feel I need it but should I take ibuprofen anyway to reduce swelling? Dr M: Good dayThis is still part of post-op surgical pain which is normal. You can take an ibuprofen. It will help with the inflammation. Emmab: HelloToday is day 4 post extraction. Well i had it out 10am on Tuesday so technically its been 96 hours but not sure if you count from the time of extraction or if that day is just day 0.  I have no pain (not on any pain relief) or bad taste or breath but the black you could see in my extraction site seems to be further down now and speckled white. I am still only eating very soft liquid food and sleeping upright. Doing salt rinses every few hours. Would you say I am unlikely to develop dry socket now? If I was just looking at the socket I feel concerned as its so far down. I do think the hole in general looks smaller and my gum behind it which was quite big seems to be coming forward. The redness above my tooth came out on day 2 and seems to be fadingMost posts I read say you will get it day 3-5 yet websites say it can develop right up to day 10 which is quite worrying.

Its the most pain I have felt since extraction. Its very bearable but feels like pressure and its only my ear i dont feel any normal toothache pain. The only thing I can relate it to is if you tense your jaw too much. I assume if this is dry socket it will really hurt by tomorrow? No smell or taste yet. My jaw is sore when I open my mouth it hurts more today than previous days. Really quite worried Dr M: If the pain is increasing and not decreasing, it is best to go back to your dentist for a follow-up visit. He can then clean it out if a dry socket is expected and give you additional antibiotics if it is needed. Emmab: It hurt a bit more for a few hours but then went away. No more pain now and its day 6 so I think that means I am in the clear?"

I can’t remember the name given to the condition but was told some years ago when they were smaller it was not a concern. Over the past year or two they have got bigger and swell/increase in size overnight and used to decrease again as the day went on but now less so. I am aware of them but they are not exactly painful and my face does not show any swelling. I rub Gengigel or Bonjela on them and also rinse in salt water which seems not to do much. I had an upper denture in the late 1970’s but abandoned it as it made me lisp and food got behind it moving it when eating despite alterations.Can anyone suggest the cause of the overnight swelling honestdoc: I don't understand when you said you had an upper denture and you still have a molar?  Without x-rays, I'm guessing the molar is necrotic and infected. Edina34: I said that had an upper denture that I abandoned honestdoc: Edina34 said:\t\t\tI said that had an upper denture that I abandoned\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nDo you still have the molar with a metal crown?  If so, you probably had a partial denture.  I was thinking full denture. Edina34: Yes, It was a partial denture and I still have the metal crowned molar. That came well after the denture probably twenty years ago.. Dr M: Good dayCan you perhaps attach a photo of the affected area? Difficult to give an opinion with limited info. Edina34: When trying that previously I found it awkward and had poor resukts Dr M: Do you perhaps then have a latest xray of the area? Edina34: No. British dentists don't do that. Dr M: Don't they take x-rays? Edina34: Yes but they don't give them to the patient to take away. That area has not been X-Rayed as the lumps and swelling have worsened since I was last there two years ago...........Dentists are not my favourite people, I cancelled three appointments over that time due to hypertension and A. Fib problems on the day. Have an appointment for next week. Dr M: Without a photo of the area or more information,  we won't be able  to give you an idea if what the problem is. Go see your dentist, and hopefully he can help you. Edina34: The gum also swells if I eat at that side which I don't usually do at the moment as I've lost a filling on one on my lower jaw."

Sometimes a \"dry socket\" can happen after extraction, and the risk increases if you smoke (regardless whether you stopped smoking prior or after extraction), immune suppressed, drinking alcohol, etc. The best idea will be to go back to your dentist and check it out. In the meanwhile, after you eat, rinse with warm salt water (bathe in your mouth for 1 minute).Hope it helps."

    "title": "Sponge left in tooth after root canal?",
    "dialogue": "JJL08: I need some advice, and I’ll try to make this short. I had a root canal done by an Endodontist back in March. He placed a temporary filling in the tooth, and the tooth already had a crown on it. I went back to my regular dentist two or three weeks later for my permanent filling. I kept having pain in my gums even after the permanent filling was placed, so I would keep going back to my regular dentist. I was told it was the tooth behind it, the tooth in front of it, the bite is too high. Now I did have cavities in those teeth I mentioned that I got fixed and I also had the bite adjusted on the root canal tooth. The gum pain kept on, and I had a weird sensation if I rubbed the top of that tooth. I thought this was weird, but I figured it was taking a long time to heal because my dentist said the root canal looked great.Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I am now seeing a new dentist, and I had cracked the filling that my previous dentist placed earlier this year on the tooth in front of the root canal tooth. I had that fixed a few weeks before Christmas, and while I was there I mentioned again my gum pain on that root canal tooth. The X-ray showed signs of infection. I know root canal treatments can fail, so I wasn’t upset too much about this.I didn’t get upset and mad until I went to see the Endodontist and he told me why I have been in pain since March. My previous dentist left the sponge/cotton pellet the endodondist put in there when he did the temporary filling. So my previous dentist filled my tooth while leaving a sponge in there. He also only halfway filled the tooth in when he permanently filled it in. I did get a second opinion and they confirmed what the Endo stated. I’m posting the X-ray to show you. Maybe it will help.I called my previous dentist and told them what happened. He is currently not wanting to take responsibility for the problem. I was told it will cost $950 to retreat the tooth. I feel like the dentist should have to pay the bill, but right now he’s not offering. I don’t go back to get it fixed until the 3rd, and they have been closed since Christmas.He supposedly told the Endodontist that the presence of a sponge was not noted on the notes that was sent over and that he didn’t see it while filling it.1. Is it common practice to place a temporary filling in a tooth that has root canal treatment, but already has a crown? The Endodontist said he would permanently fill it this time around. Why didn’t he do this the first time? This would have saved me all this trouble.2. Is it common practice to place a sponge/cotton pellet in a tooth after a root canal treatment? If so, why did a dentist with over 25 years experience not see it? Just a hypothetical question.3. Is this a case of malpractice? All I want is my previous dentist to pay for retreatment. I think that is only fair and the right thing to do since he left the material in there. I’m not sure what my legal options are.4. This will be a somewhat stupid question, but I want to verify. Do dentists have to keep extensive records of their findings? Like if he opens the tooth up and it is indeed a cotton pellet left in there, will he note that in his records? Just in case this goes to a lawyer for review or whatnot.***Here is an X-ray of the tooth. Yes, I’m aware of the cracked filling shown on the X-ray. This was taken the same day I had the filling fixed. This is not the cause of my gum pain I’ve had since March.*** malibu: Did you get a response on this? I have something similar that happened to me. Dr M: Good dayI am sorry to hear about your case.Usually after a root canal has been completed, a permanent filling is placed. The only time a temporary filling might be placed, is if the treating dentist is considering additional treatments on the tooth, such as a new crown, or if the dentist is unsure about the outcome of the root canal treatment, and might want to retreat it.A cotton pellet is usually placed after the first step of a root canal treatment, after the nerve has been removed, and covered with a temp filling. This is done to close the \" hole \" and allow the medicine to work on the inside of the tooth. After a certain period of time, you then go back to the dentist, and he removes the cotton pellet and then finishes the root canal treatment, ending with a permanent filling.\nIf the cotton pellet was left, it could lead to a failure of an adequate coronal seal, and lead to leakage, which might end up in root canal failure.\nIf the cotton pellet was left, with a temp filling, because the dentist was still planning a new permanent crown or restoration, this should have been communicated with you.\nAll this should also have been part of his dental records.I feel it is reasonable to expect the treating dentist to come to an agreement with you, because if this pain was caused by the lack of coronal seal due to a leaking temp filling/ cotton pellet left in situ, and it was not communicated with you that it was left in for a reason or that you have to go back for additional treatment on the tooth, then the dentist could be held liable.Hope this helps"

    "dialogue": "Enamel Hunter: Hello,I had a 10+ year old chipped crown on an existing root canaled tooth #46. The chipped crown was removed on Oct 09 and cleaned under and prepped for a new crown. The dentist also performed “perio lengthening” on the outside of my gum just below that tooth. I had a temporary crown placed and waited for the permanent crown schedule later.During this time the gum area outside and below tooth #46 was swollen and very irritated.It wasn’t painful unless any contact or pressure was placed on the gum area through chewing or brushing.\nOn October 27 the permanent crown was placed and dentist said that he suspected that the material of the temporary crown must have caused the gum pain and irritation as well as the perio lengthening so he asked me to monitor the area and return for further diagnosis if the problem persisted.As of today November 05 the swelling has almost gone away and minimal to no pain is present during brushing or chewing. However in contrast, the gum now looks a lot worse where there is a U shaped red and raw looking tissue (picture attached) to the outside area gum of the tooth. Any idea what is going on? honestdoc: In order to properly assess, we will need a Bitewing and periapical x-ray.  You mentioned that you had perio lengthening surgery and the tooth had a previous root canal.  There are some scenarios.  There is a chance the perio lengthening surgery was not adequate and the new crown margin violated the perio biologic width of 3 mm minimum (1 mm sulcus, 1 mm junctional epithelium, 1 mm connective tissue to bone).  Worst case scenario, the tooth may have a vertical root fracture and may not be saved.  The dentist may perform a perio probe to detect any gum attachment loss and if so, will confirm or rule out the above scenario."

Like Dr M mentioned, the fillings have a strong tendency to come loose.  I find that even with the best retention and optimal bonding environment, fillings can still separate from the tooth.  Options are to leave it alone, restore them again, and if the teeth deteriorates further, consider crowning them.  I highly recommend custom bite guards to minimize stress to the teeth. markowich: honestdoc said:\t\t\tDr M makes some really good points.

She said just to monitor it and see how it goes between now and next appointment.Is there anything other than cavities for example that could make your jaw ache? honestdoc: Grinding and clenching.  This happens very often and especially during Covid.  Consider getting Over-the-Counter night guard for now and the more expensive custom hard bite guard for long term. Worried87: Thank you honestdoc. Are there any other symptoms or ways I can easily tell it's grinding and clenching that is causing the ache? Or is that the only possibility?I will get an over the counter night guard anyway and see if that helps.Thank you. honestdoc: It can include a lot of symptoms like sore teeth, sore jaw, headaches, and sensitive teeth.  You usually aren't aware you are clenching. Worried87: Thank you. I often have headaches and my teeth are a bit more sensitive than they used to be, so looks like it could well be that. I will try and get the night guard tonight and see how that goes.Thank you again."

Dr M: Good dayIt is difficult to give an exact opinion without a consultation BUT it does sound like you had a lot of calculus associated with the affected molar. When plaque becomes hard, it becomes mineralized and forms calculus. Calculus is almost impossible to brush off with a normal toothbrush and therefore you require scaling.\nOften after removing the calculus with a scaler, the areas underneath become exposed again, as it should have been naturally, and then these areas become very sensitive. That is why you only felt the sensitivity after the cleaning. This should gradually normalize if there wasn't any severe gum recession as well.  If the calculus was there for a long period of time, a cavity could also have formed underneath or associated with the calculus. Depending on how deep the cavity was, the resultant filling could have been close to the nerve or into the nerve and thus resulted in a root canal treatment to be performed.\nThat being said, improper scaling can lead to enamel destruction and cavity formation, so it is important for whoever does the scaling to see where there was calculus or just demineralization. RMaddoc: And does this build up of calculus form on the bottom of a molar where fillings are normally placed?if I understand correctly calculus normally forms around the gumline yet she pried on area in which fillings are normally placed with all of her might, no one expects prying with the word cleaning and when a procedure is prone to using leverage of force I feel patients should be warned  that they may risk breaking stuff off causing additional problems, the innocent word cleaning was only said to me at the time when the first dentist performed it as she never mentioned scaling as afterwards I researched the procedure and found it was the term scaling when using the metal hook and my 2nd dentist confirmed that is the term which is used.\nCleaning was the bait to get patients to agree as it sounds innocent ,if told in advance that they would be doing scaling that involved such force that they risk breaking things off then patients like me could and would most likely refuse.\nFull warning should be advised aforehand .\nI had no warnings whatsoever and it also doesn't explain why they wanted to redo my crown instead of placing my old one back on.\nInstead they played as if they never seen my old crown after taking it from me which a crown on average is 800 plus dollars and insurance only pays half leaving approximately 400 dollars plus bill on my out of pocket expenses,\nThat being said is there not evidence that points to performing service for profit rather than patient wellness. Dr M: Good dayI agree that communication was not great in your situation. Proper understanding of planned procedures as well as the reasoning behind them, should have been explained to you, since this is part of informed consent."

What could it be, should it disappear as never had this before! honestdoc: It's hard to diagnose everything through this forum but I suspect you may be grinding and clenching.  The least expensive option is to go to the store and pick up a dental night guard for $20 to $30.  If that is resolving your pain but feels awkward to use, you may need to consider a custom bite guard which can run $400 or more.  You also may be brushing too hard causing irreversible gum recession and damage to the teeth.  Make sure you are using a soft bristled tooth brush and you're not scrubbing and flattening the bristles.  The bristles should look straight and new when you throw it out after 3 to 4 months."

    "dialogue": "Helloeveryone111: HiEveryone I am new to this forum, and i need some advice, i live in the uk and I am getting treated under the nhs. I had advanced decay on my upper left premolar (tooth just before the molar) my dentist did a root canal on feb 2019 with no crown, and it caused no problems, however there was a hair line crack on the tooth and eventually a small amount broke off. Then in August 2019 she did a crown on the root canal tooth, at first it did cause me problems such as throbbing and my bite was off but i thought it was just the adjustment period. Then march this year the covid happened and dentist closed. I had my dentists personal email and emailed her may time to say the crown is throbbing, she adviced to floss and use mouthwash. Then the pain went for a bit then it came back August/September time. And only to be fobbed off with antibiotics and an xray. On the xray there is a very tiny shadow on the adjacent premolar root tip which also has been root canaled by has no crown and she is blaming that tooth for my woes. I am adament it is the crowned root canel tooth that is causing the pain and not the adjacent non crowned root caneled tooth.Note: the shadow on the root tip of the adjacent premolar was there before the other tooth got crowned on xrays and at this time i had no problems, pain only occurred when tooth was crownedMy symptom: 1)Old taste in mouth 2)Throbbing which comes and goes 3) tender to bite on the crown (the adjacent premolar is absolutely fine to eat on) 4) wobbly crown that i can move with my finger nail.Any advice please honestdoc: I'm suspecting fracture.

I don’t know what to do. honestdoc: Why did your dentist bond your teeth that you didn't want?  Were there cavities or something else?  What did she say about your teeth now.  Give her a chance to correct the problem. SteveC508: Dentist 1 bonded three of my front teeth without my asking. I specifically said I had a small crack in the top of one front tooth that I asked if he could bond. I sat back in the chair. I sat back up a few minutes later and was told ‘I went ahead and bonded all 3 front teeth’. We had met several months prior and discussed potentially adding bonding to the 3 teeth. He took it entirely upon himself that day to actually do it. A few days later the bonding is bothering me. Dentist 1 is not in the office for 3 more weeks. I agree to see Dentist 2 to remove the bonding, assured she is fully capable. Dentist 2 butchers my teeth.I no longer trust the office whatsoever and will not go back to them. I’ve since seen two other dentists and have been told there is no great way to fix them. Polishing the roughness likely means removing additional enamel. Adding back bonding to fix the unevenness would likely come off since the are where I bite down. It seems the only answer is an entirely new tooth."

(Never had one before) anyway due to Covid and the situation here in the UK, they just did a perscription for amoxicillin 500 mg (3 times a day for 5 days) that I picked up from a local pharamcy.\nAnyway I am at the end of the 3rd day, and I am in constant pain.. seemed to get worse after the first day (late on Thursday evening), and I have been in a constant pain since (i'd say 8 out of 10 pain) the throbbing is unbareable at times even with Ibuprofen. Tried warm salt water rinses, a soft brissle tooth brush.. but nothing is really helping.\nAfter searching up on mouth abscess, almost all of the advice threads say that it's drained by a dentist first then antibiotics are to be taken.\nJust decided to pull my mouth open with a toothbrush (not been able to open it right due to the pain) and looked into the mirror to see what was going on, and I noticed it's right at the back of my mouth and comes across to the side (like it's split in two) and the side is a big red swallon mess.. explains all the pain I'm feeling, as my upper teeth are inprinted into the side of the swelling \nTaken a picture, but not sure if you can see it clearly.\nAnyway, should I just persist with the pain and give it 2 more days till the end of the amoxicillin, or should I be trying to get into a dentist asap? Sorry if it doesn't make sense or is too long/cluttered... it's currently 3am for me, I'm in pain and tired due to lack of sleep these past 2 nights. Sonia Salamuri: Hi!\nTooth pain is exausting, is it possible for you to get a video call to a dentist, due to the Covid? I've heard from the news that in UK somethings will be closed for some time.\nWish you to get better! A_s: Hello,If it is an abscess caused by a tooth, the best option will be to drain it through the tooth, extraction (if the tooth cannot be saved), or drain through soft tissues. Antibiotics can help to settle down the infection a bit. But after the infection has settled down, less painful, the cause of the abscess should be treated i.e. the tooth - if it is the cause. Hope you can see someone in the UK soon."

I believe it to be a oral Fibroma honestdoc: With your history of trauma, appropriately it is called Traumatic Fibroma.  Have it removed and confirm it with a biopsy. Same-dust2407: Thank you so much! I’m just curious... Why did the dentist not say to have it removed? He said I could have it removed but it wasn’t necessary?I also have a small lump in my jawline, the doctor said that this was a lymph-node because it has gone down and it hurt at one point could this be related e.g. cancer. I do know that lymph nodes sometimes never go down but just wanted to check that this could not be related! Thank you Dr M: Good day,Usually with your history, the most likely diagnoses is a traumatic fibroma. It can be biopsied if you wish, to confirm diagnoses, but in a lot of cases it is not necessary to remove it, if it is not causing you any discomfort. It is just important to be aware of this lesion, and if you notice any changes, then rather have it excised. Same-dust2407: You are all amazing thank you so much! I am a teacher and don’t get time to get things checked as much and you’ve just made my life so much easier!

During the removal the dentist used a drill and at one point I could feel a sudden sensation in the tooth.  Does that mean she drilled through enamel and hit dentin?  The tooth has also been slightly tingly at times since then (it happened over a month ago). I'm concerned the dentist removed enamel and the sensation I felt was a sign she drilled entirely through it. Dr M: Good dayIs the tooth still sensitive now? SteveC508: It is a bit yes. It still tingles or I sometimes get a light throbbing feeling. It doesn’t hurt though. I like to think it’s the tooth trying to heal itself a bit. Dr M: That might indicate that the dentin is exposed. Unfortunately it is impossible to determine what happened since everyone is different and I don't know what your enamel looked like before the time.\nIf you can get hold of some Sensodyne toothpaste, I would suggest trying some. I often advise my patients to rub some Sensodyne on the affected tooth with your finger, all over the tooth, and then leave it on the tooth. Don't rinse your mouth. Do this twice a day. This often alleviates the symptoms. SteveC508: Thank you.  I do actually use Sensodyne toothpaste, and it helps.  It's helpful to know that the sensation I'm feeling might indicate dentin is exposed.  That's what I had thought. SteveC508: Also, this is how the tooth looked before.

Usually after an extraction, the socket is filled with a blood clot, which forms granulation tissue, which appears yellow and then gradually it becomes pink.\nIf you suddenly experience pain, it might be that the socket became infected i.e dry socket, and then you need to arrange for a follow-up visit with the dentist in order to clean it out."

    "dialogue": "SteveC508: A dentist recently added, without my consent, bonding to 3 of my front bottom teeth. (I suffer from bruxism at night and had started to grind on these teeth. I had asked if he could bond one small crack in the top of one tooth and he completely bonded 3 whole teeth.) Days later I had the bonding removed and I think the dentist removed some healthy tooth with it. They now feel thinner, jagged on top, and uneven. I can’t stand it. The teeth that were bonded are 23-25, and 23/24 are the ones that bother me.My question is - I'm considering doing Ortho to correct a deep overbite that may contribute to the teeth wear. I’m also seeing a Sleep Apnea Dentist to possibly get an oral appliance to help with the bruxism. Do I bother seeing someone about the teeth that are bothering me now, or hold off since I’m considering Ortho?  I’m struggling with this on a daily basis. They aren’t sensitive, just very annoying.See a before (teeth look whiter) and after pic (teeth look a little yellower due to lighting). Dr M: Good day,It might be that not all of the material was removed evenly and thus it feels as if certain areas are a bit rough. If it bothers you a lot, you can go back to the same dentist in order for them to polish the teeth. Sometimes a little bit of polishing can make a major difference."

Do I spit out the remaining fluoride in my mouth from the toothpaste this way, making the whole point of not rinsing have no effect? Should I change my spitting habit to only spit out a little bit, and leave a small amount of foam in there, or should I do something else? honestdoc: I rinse all the toothpaste out of my mouth. The amount of Fluoride you need depends on your risk factors.  It is impossible to gauge the the microscopic Parts Per Million you've been receiving or spitting out.  1.  Does your drinking water have Fluoride?  2.  Did you have a lot of cavities at your last dental exam?  3.  Do you have a lot of fillings and dental work?  4.  Are your teeth deteriorating (if you haven't visited the dentist)?  If you are considered high risk, in addition to nutritional and oral hygiene counseling, I would prescribe you a 5000 PPM Fluoride toothpaste (no rinsing) after using regular Over the Counter high Fluoride toothpaste like Crest, Colgate, any ADA approved."

That was my goal but my fear of the dentist kept me away. i am still having difficulty right now with being comfortable and not anxious about being with a new dentist. I need some encouragement. I don’t mention my dental problems to my therapist. Yet it is the main and only source of my unhappiness and anxiety. As of right now I am in need for a deep cleaning then a dental plan. But could anyone tell me how many procedures I can get done in one day. I;m trying to get them done as soon as I can. Also I wanted to know if there is a difference with the front and back teeth. Would it be more difficult to treat? Dr M: Good dayI am sorry to hear that you have such anxiety when it comes to seeing a dentist? I don't know if you had a bad experience previously, but it is important to mention this to your dentist. In these modern times, there are a lot of methods we can employ to actually make you more relaxed when in the dental chair such as conscious sedation etc.\nWith regards to your question-my opinion would be to go for a a consultation first. This will allow the dentist to do a thorough examination and then draw up a prioritized dental plan. I say prioritized, so that the dentist can try and save the teeth that needs saving first, to prevent further tooth or associated soft or bone tissue loss. \nThe amount of procedures that can be done, depends on what type of procedure is required. Certain procedures such as root canals and crown preparations take longer than a normal filling and as such the amount of treatment would be limited, since an appointment time is also limited.\nPlease mention your fears to your dentist. We are  here to help you, and not to hurt you.

This also forms part of your medical history.\nI am sorry to hear that every dentist has only focused on the problems and proceeded with negative comments. Although it is sometimes necessary to stress the seriousness of a situation, since some patients don't take their oral hygiene seriously, it is important for the dentist also to focus on what can be done in order to fix what is needed to be fixed, in order to give you a positive outlook of what the end result should be."

We have read about  Intraoral sinus tracts (Dental fistulous) starting to wonder if this may be happening.Would such a thing show up on cbct scan as we have had one but no infection or abcess showing.It may explain why the toothache is worse sometimes than others as the pressure would build and as the pus releases ease again.Had a not too bad day then major pain for a couple of days then last night he flossed and noticed more blood than has been and today the fluid leaking is much more again.  Been leaking all day explained as equivalent of a cup full. When mentioned to our dentists about the fluid they dont seem to have come across it.Also noticed yesterday when taking pain killers getting the taste of what he has had coming back through in the fluid.\nAny ideas? honestdoc: There are some details that don't make sense.  1)  Who are you talking about that is experiencing this?  2)  Why did \"he\" need CBCT scan?  3)  Your dentist couldn't figure your problem?  4)  Why is \"he\" taking pain killers?  Try to provide an x-ray of the area and a picture.  We can't read minds with all these vague details. zorba25: Sorry for the lack of clarity just wanted a\na general idea on a sinus tract as I have posted previously in an earlier thread in relation to the history of my husband’s toothpain and problems.  He has seen both his NHS dentist and we have paid to also see a private dentist due to the restrictions for doing any detailed treatment currently with the pandemic. (the NHS are limited at present) neither dentist can see any infection or decay on xray or by examination or identify where the pain is coming from) .  The CBCT scan was done to see if more detail would help but hasn’t.He has been taking pain killers for the toothache as advised by Dentist and Doctor.\nWe do not have a copy of the xray or scan currently. \t\t\t\t\t\tToothache for weeksMy hubby has now had toothache for over 9 weeks and due to the current situation is hitting walls with no NHS medical services and no idea what to do.  Started initially with bleeding gums both top and bottom on left handside. Used corsadyl for a bit and sorted the bleeding.  Then started a few...www.dentistry-forums.com\n\t\t\t\t\nThanks honestdoc: \"Sinus tract\" may be interpreted in 2 ways.  The sinus has a thin membrane over the top teeth.  When a top molar tooth gets extracted, there is a risk for perforating the membrane and the sinus and the mouth will have an unfortunate connection.  Another interpretation of \"Sinus tract\" is a fistula where the tooth abscess wants to drain in the path of least resistance.  There will be a pimple in the gum with drainage.  Usually the x-ray will detect the abscess if enough time has passed.  If the abscess is acute and recent, it may not show up on x-rays since the abscess needs time to resorb through the bone.  With the extended period of time your husband is suffering, any abscess will be detectable.  What are all the medical conditions and medications your husband is taking?  It is impossible for anyone to diagnose on this forum especially without any images, x-rays, tools, and full work up.  Your husband's case seem complicated since many doctors aren't able to determine the problem.  I suggest you consider  seeing an experienced faculty at a dental school or similar private dentist.  Since I'm in the US, I'm guessing that the NHS dentists are inexperienced and unmotivated. zorba25: Thank you for your reply.  The medications are basic ibrupofen and paracetamol as he still has to work and drive so nothing stronger however, due to the length of time he has had the pain and been taking tablets these are starting to affect his stomach and he is getting fatigued easily so he is trying where possible to reduce the painkillers.The NHS dentists are very restricted in what they can do at present basically anything involving aerosol procedures there is no sign of when they can perform these as yet such as root canals or replacing teeth with implants or dentures etc if they extract any. This is partly why we went private as they have full PPE and are carrying out more indepth procedures but currently they still cannot see where the issue is they have wondered if there may be a crack in the tooth that isn’t showing and it is a capped tooth which is the possible culprit so the testing is not as simple.we have at long last managed to get an appointment with the hospital this week to see the oral surgery and maxillio facial department so we are hoping something gets resolved.we just wondered on the fistula as a possibility on the fluid so we can then raise this with them.  The leaking has eased again today and the pain subdued slightly again which would make sense if it then takes pressure off until the fluid builds up again.  Thank you again for your help. zorba25: Meant to ask with a fistula is the pimple always on the gum and visible or is there a chance the exit point could be between the teeth outside of immediate view? honestdoc: Yes, drainage can happen anywhere.  If it is between the teeth, the gums will look more red and puffy (healthy gums are light pink and very tight).  Fractures are very tough to detect but if it is deep, with the time your husband had been suffering, it should show up on x-rays as stated previously. zorba25: Thank you again for your help it is most appreciated zorba25: Dentist has advised on trying a mouthguard for a couple of weeks now which my husband has done but it hasn’t helped and now his speech is affected. He has stopped using it as it has made things worse.  The dentist has just had to rearrange his revisit and he is due to go and see him in a few days.  could the mouth guard have caused this and will it gradually rectify or should we be more concerned? honestdoc: I don't believe the mouth guard will affect his speech unless he leaves it in during speech.  Is it Over-the-Counter drugstore bought or custom made?  If it is custom made and he takes it out, I cannot explain his speech difficulty. zorba25: Custom made"

Thanks in advance! honestdoc: I'm not sure you can find this protocol.  The procedure code is D0120.  This exam will be a continuation from New Patient Exam (D0150).  What I do is to review health history including medical conditions, medications taken, and drug allergies.  I do exams on head & neck and inside the mouth for any unusual lesions (cancer or tumors).  I exam the x-rays on your bone health, cavities, and teeth deterioration.  The hygienist will probe your gums to check for any gum disease.  I would go over all my findings and develop a treatment plan and recommendations.  There may be situations where I refer you to appropriate providers such as your physician for consistent high blood pressure readings, TMJ specialist for TMJ pain, gum specialist (periodontist) for serious gum disease, oral surgeon for any precancerous or cancerous lesions, etc.  This code is utilized in the US.

If the partial is acrylic, then additional clasps might provide a bit more retention and stability. Alternatively a chrome-cobalt partial denture could be considered. They are a lot more comfortable than acrylic partial dentures, and the various design options provide a bit more stability and retention, but a chrome cobalt denture is also more expensive.\nDiscuss your worries with your dentist, and see what can be done.\nYour speech should normalize once you get used to the partial denture.

    "dialogue": "Cloud: I chipped my tooth swimming and was wondering how I go about fixing it. I’ve read bonding lasts 4-8 years, but is there nothing else that’s a permanent solution? Thanks honestdoc: In dentistry, no artificial material will match natural tooth.  There are considerations in material, amounts of drilling trauma, and longevity.  Typically bonding involves less drilling.  This is appropriate if the defect/damage is small.  Unfortunately as you read, bonding's longevity can be short under certain conditions.  If you subject your teeth to a lot of trauma such as grinding/clenching, habits like chewing nails, ice or other objects, and or have malocclusion (non-ideal teeth positioning), then bonding will not last.  Porcelain (or Zirconia) crowns are more durable, but since they involve a lot of drilling, it is not appropriate for a small chip.  For many activities that can potentially damage teeth, I recommend sports mouth guard.  I have a custom sports guard like the professional athletes use and I use it for mountain biking, basketball, and martial arts training.  You can pick up an Over-the-Counter Sports Mouth Guard at any drugstore. Cloud: Thanks for the reply!My dentist is out on vacation and I was planning to ask her this question below.I’ve seen YouTube videos by other dentist that if the chip is small they polish the area. I’m guessing they shave off part of the tooth like teeth contouring where it makes your tooth line up. Unless polishing is completely something else. honestdoc: Yes, I had chipped my tooth and I had my dentist (unable to do it myself) smooth it.  There is no fee for smoothing so hopefully your dentist doesn't charge you for the procedure.  She may charge you for the limited evaluation."

How should my lower jaw be and where should my tongue be?When you are watching tv, reading or driving is it A or B for you?A) Are your upper and lower teeth touching each other?In other words, is your mouth/jaws closed tightish shut and the lower and upper teeth slightly clenched together.   Upper teeth sitting firmly on the lower teeth.Or is it for youB Are your upper and lower teeth not touching each other?Jaws not fully closed, mouth not fully shut but, not open-mouthed. Lower and upper teeth not touching but very close to touching.  You have about a 1 to 2 millimeter space between all the upper and lower teeth. thetiggler: When my face and lower jaw are in a relaxed state where should my tongue be?  When you are in a relaxed state is your tongue touching the roof of your mouth?  If it does touch the roof of your mouth is your tongue touching the upper jaw front teeth or is your tongue further back touching the middle of the roof of your tongue? honestdoc: When you are at rest, your teeth should be about quarter inch to 1/3 inch apart (or about 1 cm).  Your tongue position may vary.  If your tongue is higher above you lower teeth, it may block your airway particularly during sleep which could cause sleep apnea.  It is favorable if your tongue rests as low as possible."

    "title": "Tooth pain 10 days after filling",
    "dialogue": "sedadadss: went in for gum pain. Basically I felt sharp pain in between teeth/gum area while I was having dinner and thought something is stuck so I used soft brushes to poke which caused a lot of bleeding.Dentist said I probably hurt myself with the brushes and that salt rinses should help. She said there is very tiny cavity on that tooth which needs a filing. She also said she will open the gum area or something to treat it. I was like ok please treat it and make my gum pain go away.A filing was done which took 1 hour.Since the filing last week, my tooth is in pain every time I bite down and also pain in all teeth in the treatment area when I floss. Now this is two types of which I NEVER had before going to the dentist. On top of this, the treatment made no difference to the gum pain what so ever.Told the dentist about this. She cleaned my gum where I was having pain and that finally made the pain go away. Regarding the tooth pain now, she said 'bite needs adjustment' and that its very 'common'.  This made it a bit better where I can at least eat but still causes slight pain. She said pain might still happen after a filing and if its still there for 10 days, come back again.WHAT UTTER BULLSH#$ !! come back again if the pain is still there after 10 days?? really?Now I've had filings before and never did I experience pain in the TOOTH a WEEK after the filing. How is it possible that a tooth that never caused pain suddenly starts causing pain after a filing??I can not eat properly now, I can not bite properly without feeling pain. Flossing makes my teeth hurt.I have a strong feeling she screwed up something up.Here are my x-rays. Did I even need a filing? or they just wanted to shell $100 out of me for nothing.before treatment x-rays: after treatment x-rays: Dr M: Good dayDo you perhaps have any post-op x-rays of the filling after it was done. Sometimes after a filling was done, there might be some sensitivity for a day or two, but this should gradually go away, especially if the filling was not deep. If the filling was deep, it might be that the nerve got irritated, leading to pulpitis and pain.\nDo you have photos of the area, so that I can see if the gum is inflamed in the area, or swollen or not?\nOn the x-rays, it doesn't look like you have any fillings that should have gone close to the nerve. sedadadss: Dr M said:\t\t\tGood dayDo you perhaps have any post-op x-rays of the filling after it was done.

    "title": "Front Teeth Erosion, Bonding Fail",
    "dialogue": "scody: Hi all!I (32/f) moved to a new state in 2015 and was sad to leave my long time family dentist. I went to my first cleaning at a new dentist and they said I should have my front teeth bonded due to abnormal erosion. They couldn’t figure out what caused the erosion (“do you suck on lemons?”). Basically there are “indents” in the top middle 2 teeth, especially towards the inside. In photos this area looks grey. The top teeth do look thin and there are vertical cracks.They bonded the front middle 4 teeth. It looked fine. The bonding came off a tooth within 24 hours, first when I bit into a piece of pizza. They rebonded it, and then I bit into a soft tortilla and another entire bonded tooth piece came off. They rebonded my front teeth maybe 8 times over the next 2 months, all 4 teeth, and even had the orthodontist next door check my bite (couldn’t find any issues). The bonded pieces either all came off pretty quickly, or they detached in corners and I would feel it unattached with my tongue, and things like a piece of black pepper would be stuck in between the tooth and the bonding (and then it would eventually loosen and fall off). I was back at square one (nothing on the teeth) and horrified of going back to have this work done again just for it to fail. I literally have post traumatic stress from this experience, being horrified to eat anything, have the anxiety that my teeth are going to crack and fall out constantly. I had nightmares for years and would constantly check my front teeth with my tongue to make sure everything was ok. (Also, the last time and final time I went in, the bonding on the front teeth was so ridiculously crooked.)\nSO... are my front teeth cursed? Should I let another dentist (maybe a cosmetic specialist) bond them? Should I do veneers? Crowns? (I’m horrified that they’ll just break and fall off like the bonding!) Cost isn’t an issue, but my sanity is.\nAny helps or ideas appreciated!Extra background info: I had braces for 5 years or so, 2nd grade to 7th grade. I have a permanent metal bar/retainer on my lower bottom teeth (this is bonded on, and still holding strong).Note: Photos included. These are current photos, no bonding. Dr M: Good dayIt does like you have extremely thin enamel. Although rare, in some cases enamel dysplasia could be related to either an infection, genetics or antibiotics use during the development and mineralization of the affected teeth.\nBonded restorations tend to not last very long, since they can easily be chipped off due to the fact that you use these teeth to bite into things.\nThe best option for you would most likely be full coverage crowns. With the fact that your enamel is already so thin, unfortunately the crown preparations might need to go hand in hand with root canals, due to the preparations being close to the nerve.\nThey will most likely give you a better outcome than bonded restorations and/or veneers which is almost as expensive as full crowns."

I first noticed it about 2 weeks ago, it feels a little rough over the tongue I think. I have been using Colgate whitening paste with baking soda, may I ask why this is actually damaging? I've also ordered some crest whitening strips so will see how they work before trying the other options you mentioned.Finally, in the attached, I've posted an updated picture from today. It kinda seems like it has gotten worse but I cant tell if so or just lighting? I'd be really grateful to get your opinion.Many thanks\nSamuel honestdoc: Whitening toothpaste are usually more abrasive and can damage the enamel and gums. If the stain is external (my guess), try the whitening strips' chemical action to bleach out the staining.  If the results are not to your liking, try the professional strength from you dentist office.  Last resort is for your dentist to lightly drill and place bonding filling. SamGC96: Thank you so much"

    "title": "Extractions and then denture",
    "dialogue": "Garyf1985: Hi all, just found this group online due to seeking information/advice. I have a severe phobia of dentists and as a result my teeth have deteriorated so much that I now require 6 top teeth removed along the front and a couple at the back top and bottom (wisdoms). I'll be given a short term denture and then long term I'll most likely be getting a more permanent denture as implants are just far too expensive. Basically I am looking to see if anyone has had similar done and how the experience was ie. The extractions and then getting used to the denture. I'll be sedated for the extractions due to my phobia, so to summarise, 8 teeth removed, short term denture then return for a more permanent denture. Anyone had similar and can advise what to expect etc, hopefully put my mind at ease slightly.Thanks for your time. Dr M: Good day,You are referring to what we call an immediate partial denture. Usually this denture is place immediately after extractions, hence the term. \nFor the first 24 hours, don't remove the denture at all. Then for the next week, only remove the denture after meals, to rinse out your mouth to clean the extraction sockets, and to clean the dentures. After about a week you can remove it at night. This will allow the tissues to adapt to the denture.\nInitially you will have some discomfort in certain areas, since the denture presses on the sockets and might also cause pressure ulcers in other areas. It is important to not that you can then go and have them adjusted a bit, to relieve the pressure. This might happen a few times and require a few adjustments.\nEating might be difficult. Stick to soft foods in the beginning and then gradually work your way up. Get used to cutting food into smaller more manageable pieces.\nSpeech might also be affected, since your tongue has to get used to the smooth surface of the denture on your palate. Speak slowly in the beginning, and then usually it normalizes by 2 weeks.\nThe denture will gradually become loose, since your bone in the areas where you removed the teeth, will gradually diminish as well as the associated soft tissues.\nThis is usually why after about 6 months you will have to have the denture either relined, to adapt it to the new dimensions of your mouth, or have a new denture made once your bone level has stabilized."

    "dialogue": "Sarahottawa: I had a biking accident 2 weeks ago where I chipped my 2 front teeth.I was seen and the dentist said my tooth was fractured (visible but can’t be « felt » so no treatment advised there) and I had an exposed nerve. Note- I had no pain. He covered the nerve with calcium and did a bonding for the chipped teeth, telling me we were trying to avoid a root canal. Teeth are still sensitive, mostly like a pressure feeling and won’t chomp with them, but still no pain. 4 days after the accident I noticed that the one tooth with the exposed nerve is turning a little bit gray.Is this more likely to just be a temporary bruise or is my tooth dying? How could I know?thanks honestdoc: The gray discoloration indicates the nerve had some excess bleeding in the pulp space from trauma.  Since your nerve appears fairly open, there may be potential for vascular repair.  Don't expose it to too much colds.  Cold substances could traumatize the nerve more and damage it.  Couple of scenarios could happen if it doesn't heal.  You could experience intense pain which may indicate irreversible nerve damage.  You could experience no pain but swelling which indicates the nerve dying and becoming a source of infection.  Either way, you may need a Root Canal."

Dentist days it could be because of upper wisdom tooth and I removed it. I still have the same pain in the lower jaw and neck even after the removal. I am still finding answer for that.I didn't have any stiches after the WT extraction. I went for follow-up after 2 weeks of extraction and OMFS said it's healing good. Now, I noticed a small lump which is very hard on the gum of the extraction site. It's been there for 2 weeks now. It was painful if I touch or press. And sometime gives sore pain. I thought it will go off on it's own. It didn't. Since I have severe pain in the lower jaw and neck, I couldn't differentiate if it's from this boil on the gum.I went today to check with OMFS. He said, it's a bone fragment and told me to wait for 2 more weeks to see if how it goes. If it's painful, told me to come back to take it off. He asked if it's painful and I said it gives some sore pain sometimes. He told me to wait for 2 weeks and see.I came home and now I feel some throbbing and sore pain on that spot on and off. Sometimes like pinching pain. Is it something to check it out soon or can I wait? What is shaving it off mean? Will it be another anesthetic procedure? I was so nervous at dental office and didn't ask much questions to the OMFS.Is this normal to have that in the gum? Will it go away on its own? How do they do it? What if we leave it like that? Is it harmful? Please anyone who experienced this before, please share your inputs. Dr M: Usually after an extraction , the alveolar bone resorbs in various dimensions. Sometimes sharp edges can occur during this process, that can be painful on the associated gingiva and even cause an ulcer. In such cases, a conservative alveolotomy can be considered. This is done under local anaesthetic. No need for general anaesthesia. The sharp bone will be exposed and then the sharp edge will be cut with a bone rongeur instrument or it can be shaved with a surgical drill.

Used corsadyl for a bit and sorted the bleeding.Then started a few weeks later with toothpain in front insisor (prev capped and root canal about 12 yrs ago). Still has this pain after 9 weeks. Initially couldn’t see a dentist due to lockdown and even once opened only gave phone advise they gave antibiotics and he was told to take paracetamol. Didn’t work by this time they were willing to do xray nothing showing up so they gave stronger antibiotics. These seemed to start the pain to get worse and made him feel a lot worse.\nnow bottom teeth have started which dentist says need to brush harder but gums are physically receded in last week or so and pain worsening plus sudden onset of fatigue over last few weeks comes over like a wave to extreme just smallest thing creates major tiredness.  Plus bad taste in mouth and at one point felt like fluid leaking from teeth.Doctors won’t physically see him we eventually got bloods done but nothing out of norm other than white platelets and neutrophils doubled compared to last test but still in ranges.Had to see a private dentist still can’t see anything on xrays and we have booked for root canal in case a crack in tooth causing but can’t do until September as busy. My husband is now struggling and doesn’t think he can go on with it so the only option looks like to start pulling teeth but seems drastic as we don’t know which as both top and bottom now a problem which seems very unlucky if this has all happened together.Worried in case an infection spreading but just don’t know what to do and who to contact as NHS dentist and doctors not dealing with and looks a while before they will.Feel totally lost with it all and the stress is getting worse each day.Any ideas if had something similar. Does anyone know if abcess can be missed on xray although now had a further xray since the pain got worse and still nothing showing.Really starting to worry now as seems to be worsening but not classed as an emergency unless his face swells and can’t breathe apparently.  Then they will just pull it - with one being a front tooth it’s difficult. Dr M: Good dayA tooth can have secondary infection, even though the tooth has had a root canal treatment done on it. The root canal could be short filled, or there could be a lack of apical seal or a lot of other similar reasons.  It could also have a crack, which might be difficult to pick up on a conventional x-ray, and might require some more sophisticated scans, such as a CBCT.\nThe increase in white cells and neutrophils, indicate that there is some infection and that the body is mounting an immune response.\nThe bleeding gums, could also be an indication of a severe gingivits, which could also lead to pain, a bad smell and/or taste in the mouth, as well as swelling in certain areas.\nDo you perhaps have photos of his teeth/gums and a photo of his x-rays that were taken? It is difficult to give more of an opinion, since more information is needed. zorba25: Thank you so much for your reply unfortunately we do not have the xrays but may be able to sort a photo.The gum issue seems to have suddenly started since the second antibiotics. Seems really bad luck to get the top and bottom teeth at the same time is it likely one may be connected to the other?There hasn’t been any bad breathe or smell only the taste.If a tooth/cap is cracked is a further root canal likely to work or is it normally extracted?Do patients normally suffer such fatigue with these things literally gone from being a fairly fit individual to having to rest after doing something simple like having a shower or putting on a pair of socks. Sorry for all the questions and do appreciate your help.\nWe have recontacted his dentist again and they have agreed to do a deep clean and prescribed some form of prescription toothpaste for the gum issue. So fingers crossed on that part but even if that works we still have the top tooth issue.He has always flossed and cleaned with electric toothbrush quite well so quite frustrating that it’s all happening now at a difficult time.Thank you again your comments are very much appreciated. Dr M: A photo will help a lot.\nUsually a gum issue might require a deep cleaning to be done, so it is good that his dentist will do that.\nIf a tooth is cracked, it depends on how deep the crack goes. If the crack extends into the root of the tooth, then the tooth will have to be extracted unfortunately.\nIt is strange that he is suffering from fatigue. Usually tooth related issues, won't cause such fatigue, especially after a simple task like putting on a pair of socks. I think it is best he goes to see a medical doctor regarding this issue. zorba25: Thank you again for taking the time to reply.  Couldn’t persuade him to do a photo.He has now had a deep clean around the area but still currently same level of pain and fatigue.  We expect it will need to settle for a couple of days.  The dentist has advised to come back in 2 weeks she noticed a weak area on a tooth but not the one in pain.  Her option is to remove the nerve and then at some time in future extract the tooth but not yet as will be s long time before able to replace it.\nIf the top tooth still an issue then will look to refer to hospital but who knows how long a wait that will be.  We are starting to think it must be a fine crack not showing up.\nHad blood tests that came back ok and Doctors don’t seem to want to know at the minute to progress anything further.will see in next 48 hours if anything settles from the deep clean. Sonia Salamuri: There is also problems related to sinus, that could give a lot of pain and sometimes looks like there's something wrong with the upper teeth. I think the CBCT could help you in solving that mistery, along with a visit to an endodontist (because of the tooth with root canal). They have a microscope that helps a lot to find cracks that are difficult to spot with the naked eye, even in the X-ray. Mixing different types of medication could also give that fatigue problem, along with stress of dealing with the constant pain. zorba25: Hi Husband still with pain and nothing yet found to be able to sort it.  Paid for a cbct scan and nothing showing up.The one thing he has constantly noted is fluid leaking through into his mouth with a bad taste as though from the teeth. He has mentioned this now to both the NHS and the private dentist and both noted as though never heard of anything like that.We have read about a sinus tract that can develop to drain pus from a chronic infection has anyone ever had or heard of this and would know how it is identified. There are no infections showing up still on xrays, would such tracts show on one?Intraoral sinus tracts (Dental fistulous tracts. no obvious pimples showing on the gums."

I had mercury fillings placed directly into my gum when I never even needed the filling done I have since found out . It is such a horrible fillings and am ill please any dentists  look at it and tell me if it is a normal filling as I am sure it is illegal . Mercury is so toxic I was unaware before but worst of all the way it’s done Dr M: Good dayThe photo is very blurry, but the filling looks like a classic inter-proximal amalgam filling ( filling that goes in between teeth) and is most likely only \" touching the gum \" , because the cavity was most likely deep. There is currently no evidence to show that amalgam fillings is poisonous to the body. It is still routinely placed in certain practices.

The whole was only so big because of the original unneeded filling. Amalgam cracks teeth! I have read over thousand hours and mercury is toxic .  Methyl mercury comes from fillings when drilled or even through saliva. Mercury is not safe and even more so I’m allergic patients like me . Are you a dentist or what? Dr M: I am a dentist yes. There has been no clinical evidence to show that any amalgam filling in the mouth has been toxic to the patients that have them. When amalgam fillings are drilled, special precautions are taken in order to limit the amount of material that enters your system. This is done with high volume suction units and some dentists even remove amalgam under rubberdam isolation. \nIf you happen to get methyl mercury in your system, the amount needed in order to have any measurable neurotoxic effect, is more than you would get from drilling a filling.\nIf you are allergic to mercury or any other metals, this should have been mentioned to your dentist before the restoration was placed.\nThis is part of your medical history. Dr M: Methyl mercury usually comes from fish, or from drinking water. Elemental mercury is the mercury found in dental amalgam and then releases a mercury vapor when drilled. This is not harmful. And as previously mentioned, even methyl mercury is only poisonous when you are exposed to a lot of it.\nIf you are truly allergic, then you should have the filling removed and replaced with a resin filling Benn: Please re train as a dentist sir. I spent my salary on getting removed by a holistic dentist . It is most dangerous substance on earth and has caused me illness and teeth to crack sir honestdoc: I am a dentist and you absolutely have no science knowledge.  When mercury gets mixed with other metals, it loses its toxicity.  I have mercury fillings in my mouth so it is very disrespectful for an ignorant person to respond like you did.  Do you know that tooth colored fillings holistic dentists use also have metals in them?  The white fillings have Barium Sulfate so the fillings will show up white (radiopaque) on x-rays to indicate fillings instead of voids.  White fillings also shrink about 1% when light cured (polymerization shrinkage) so that introduces potential for microleakage.Holistic dentists do not believe in Fluoride.  Without adequate Fluoride, the teeth minerals are vulnerable to acid damage.  It doesn't matter to them because they can make more money doing more work on you as your teeth deteriorates further. Benn: I have a degree in chemistry see smoking teeth documentary and tell me it don’t leak .

I'm sure I'm suffering from toxicity in parts per trillion (insignificant) and probably exposing myself on outside radiation and radon gas.  As I was explaining to a fellow forum user in PM, amalgams are an outdated restorative material and there are some options out there that seem promising such as bioactive restorative materials.  I despise other dentists bad mouthing each other.  They have to bad mouth in order to upsell their inferior skills.  What if your competitor bad mouths you to me and I tell you to go back to school?For your information, we dentists and doctors are required to \"retrain\" 20-25 hrs every year (depending on state) to maintain our license. honestdoc: Benn said:\t\t\tI have a degree in chemistry see smoking teeth documentary and tell me it don’t leak .

You have to understand there are pros and cons to every dental procedures and dental materials.  I believe in keeping it simple, predictable, and minimal trauma.  It is traumatic to drill on teeth which is why I refused to get any of my  good fillings replaced.  There are a lot of hungry dentists who want to replace good silver fillings for white ones.  Afterwards I get calls about extremely sensitive teeth after the new fillings are placed.  As a result these people think all dentists are bad since they never had any problems before.

Dr M: I am sorry that you feel this way. As honestdoc said previously, the mercury that is in a amalgam filling, is non toxic since it is in combination with other metals.\nPlease find attached, just one of the many, and I emphasize many, peer-reviewed articles that try and illustrate that there is no clinical evidence to show that there is a need to discontinue the use of amalgam or to remove clinically acceptable restorations. \nI have highlighted a paragraph that will hopefully try and explain what we are trying to bring across. \nYou can take some time, and read up yourself on all the decades of research that was done on this topic. Just go on Google Scholar and have a look.\nI am sure, as you have stated, that you are also a professional person. Rather than taking a dentist to court over one filling, have you tried asking the dentist to replace the filling with a filling more to your liking? There is no need to rush to court-I am sure you would understand if you were in a similar situation. I am not even sure if the case will be taken up to be honest either way.\nThere are risks when removing a filling that is clinically acceptable restoration, such as Honestdoc mentioned. Foremost possible pulpal damage or additional tooth structure loss. But an amalgam filling can also be safely removed under the correct protocols as we are taught as dentists.\nI really hope that you can ease your mind when you take the time to do additional research, and to know that no harm will come to you.\nAnd in the future, please ask your dentist to not place amalgam restorations. Dr M: Please find attached the article I mentioned. There are a lot of others if this one is not to your liking. Dr M: Hope you find this helpful. honestdoc: Benn said:\t\t\tSir it’s ok to be upset you have a toxic metal in your mouth as do I . That is known as the second most toxic element .

Good luck with court.  Going to court is very expensive and your lawyer will decide if it is worth his/her time to invest in it.  As stated before, every filling case is different and there are different restorative options.  I feel sorry for you being a \"scientist\" and not know the difference between legit science vs fake science.

    "title": "Does tooth verticar root fracture show a symptoms? Different Endo opinions.  How to know if I need a Rct or not. Anyone experienced like this before?",
    "dialogue": "Du_deleted: Hi,\nI have been dealing with lower jaw pain under earlobe for past 3 months. I have ear pain, lower jaw pain with Swelling in the jaw. I have severe pain in the lower jaw. After a month, I started feeling pain on the side of the neck. It's mildly swollen too.  I have some spots in the side of the neck and under the earlobe in the lower jaw. I have been to ENT and different dentists. No ear infection. My dentist said it could be from a tooth crack or fracture on tooth#30 or upper wisdom tooth. I extracted the upper wisdom tooth 7 weeks back and no changes in my symptoms. I have pain on top side of the head above the ear. It hurts whenever I open the jaw and my jaw clicks or pops Everytime.  My upper molars are so tight since may when all these started. It's still the same and no increase or decrease in the swelling. It's the same. I went to an Endo based on my dentist referral and he tested. He said no fracture.  And during the cold test, I felt more sensitivity on that tooth and felt soreness for 20 seconds after that. \nI felt pain to bite on one spot on that tooth. So he said no RCT needed. I told him that pain in the lower jaw is so severe and throbbing when I lie down.  So, he said if it's throbbing pain to lie down , I can do RCT and send me with a treatment plan.Meanwhile, I saw an OMFS for a post op follow up and he said my issue might be TMJ issue and referred me to tmj specialist. I have severe pain in the lower jaw under ear lobe and side of the neck. It hurts to touch under the ear and neck. It's so tender and sore. My PCP told me to try physical therapy if it's from tmjd and any muscular issue. My dentist is very sure that my issue is from the tooth crack only. He said all the pain and swelling could be a referred pain from the tooth crack on #30. He talk to the referred Endo and he told me to so RCT with Endo and come back to him for a crown. I never had RCT before and very nervous and panic about it. I am not against my dentist treatment plan or thoughts. I wanted to know if my jaw pain under earlobe and neck swelling and pain is from the tooth crack before proceeding with RCT. But no answer for that. I did see a physical therapist based on my PCP suggestion. He did say that my symptoms looks like tmjd and needed some manual therapy treatment. But my PT wanted to make sure if there is no issue from the tooth before moving on with PT. \nI went to another Endodontist today to check if any issue on my #30 tooth. This Endo has good Google reviews and was listening to me so patiently. He didn't take any new x-rays as I have all my x-rays and CBCT scan. He didn't see my cbct scan or didn't take one. He said the scan is not required. He did bite test, cold test, fibre optic light test. I felt little soreness after the cold on that tooth. I also felt some pain to bite on one spot on that tooth. He said, no RCT needed now. Couldn't see any crack in the light. If it's a root fracture, we cannot see it. But other symptoms will show up. So, told me to check with TMJ specialist and ENT for the jaw and neck pain. So, I have 2 different opinions regarding the root canal now. So, it's very confusing how to proceed further. Is it really a crack or I should hold on with RCT for now?\nAny thoughts or inputs anyone? Please. P.S: during my 2 Endo visits, both the Endo didn't take or see the cbct scan. They said it's really not necessary. But during my first dental visit, the dentist said that I have fracture by seeing the cbct. So it's very confusing why the Endo not seeing the cbct scan and they rely on cold test and bite test along with fibre optic light test. honestdoc: If you get a vertical fracture on a tooth or root, it may take a few weeks to manifest into gum attachment damage.  The dentist will probe around your normal teeth with readings like 3 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm.  If vertical root fracture happened about 4-6 weeks before, depending on how deep the fracture is, the readings will be like 3 mm, 7 mm, 3 mm.  The 7 mm indicates gum attachment loss (damage).  After a few months, the bone around the problem root or fracture will show damage on x-ray as black (radiolucent).

Like scratching over the gum area? I do remember that my new Endodontist did that yesterday. He said it will be very tender and painful before doing it. I felt so painful and tender. He scratched over the gum, but he didn't say anything like these values. He was checking all the tooth gum area. This was the first test he did. It's been 3 months since this issue started. He didn't take any new x-rays though. Saw my old x-rays. If its a root fracture, it would atleast show up with a gum probe by now? I did email my general dentist after the second Endo opinion. Endo have sent his report to my dentist as well. My dentist is not so friendly and good with anxious dental patients like me. He replied me that, what is your next step and getting multiple opinions can be very confusing. So, he is not suggesting anything on my issue now. He just want me to decide my next plan and let him know about it. He actually want me to try the RCT and see if helps in my symptoms. He told me that when I talk to him last week. I have very severe pain in the lower jaw under earlobe, side of the neck. It has a small lump on the side of the neck. It's very painful to touch the jaw area and neck. My PCP wants me to do a neck ultrasound to check if that lump is a cyst. I have mild swelling in the side of the neck for last 2 months and in the jaw for last 3.months.I did ask the new Endodontist that a crack will cause these symptoms. She said certainly not. So, it's confusing if I am missing something or should try RCT and see if I have a root fracture or not since it's not visible on the xray or through diagnosis."

    "dialogue": "rach.atkinson: Hi , just joined . Just wondered if anyone has had the same experience as me ! \nI had my 2nd molar removed in January and ever since my wisdom tooth behind it has been hurting on and off. Dentist thought I might be biting down on it and it hurting so 3 dentist visits later they kept filing it down. Pain comes and goes but is getting worse now . Filed tooth down again a couple if weeks ago but it’s still getting worse.  They sent me for a dental x ray at the hospital and they have just rang me and said that they cannot see anything wrong on the x ray so they are referring me to another hospital further away to do some more Tests? Please help ? Thank you . I have photos of the X-ray too Dr M: Good dayCan you please attach photos of the x-ray? rach.atkinson: Dr M said:\t\t\tGood dayCan you please attach photos of the x-ray?\n\t\t\nClick to expand... honestdoc: Fortunately I'm not seeing any disease and according to the pano x-ray, you had your Lower Right first molar removed.  The 2nd molar behind it has the tendency to tip forward (towards the midline, mesial drift).  You don't have a wisdom tooth on that side unless your wisdom tooth shifted to the 2nd molar position.  Since the molar was extracted, your biting dynamics have changed shifting more biting stress on the 2nd molar.  I recommend trying an Over-the-Counter Night Guard at your local drug store and consider full restorative options to stabilize your bite and consider custom bite guard. rach.atkinson: Thank you for your reply. I forgot to say in first bit that I had a bite guard made about 3 weeks ago and have been wearing it every night for 3 weeks and it just seems to be getting worse. Feel like I’m imagining the pain that comes and goes because no one can see anything wrong ! I’m very scared that no one knows what’s wrong as I don’t want to be in pain for the rest of my life . rach.atkinson: Also I was told that the tooth was my wisdom tooth as when I was younger i had 4 teeth removed to get prepared for a brace which I didn’t end up having honestdoc: rach.atkinson said:\t\t\tAlso I was told that the tooth was my wisdom tooth as when I was younger i had 4 teeth removed to get prepared for a brace which I didn’t end up having\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nI'm not trying to contradict you unless you provided someone else's x-ray.  Usually the 4 teeth removed for braces are 1st Premolar (Bicuspids) and sometimes 2nd Premolars on all 4 quads.  I notice you have both Premolars on LR, UL, & LL.  Only the UR is where you have the 2nd Premolar missing.  I suspect you had all wisdom teeth removed (3rd molars).  You can see on the LR (LL on the x-ray) where you have no 3rd molar and remnants of where the first molar was extracted.Do you have expanded x-ray showing the neck of your jaw bone?  I wonder if you have any arthritic changes in you TMJ.  I suggest you see a TMJ specialist for an opinion of your pain.  I agree with the previous dentists in that the x-ray provided (other than images of your TMJ joint) show no sources of your pain.  My differential guesses from most likely to least is this.  1.  TMJ/grinding/clenching joint degeneration 2.  Referred pain from previous injury(ies) or surgeries, 3. idiopathic (unexplained) or further workup/details (medical conditions, etc) are needed. rach.atkinson: I think if I remember rightly I have had 10 teeth removed. The pain is not only on that back tooth sometimes it seems likes it’s spreading along my jawline- both upper right and lower right. That’s the only x ray I have I’m afraid . I did read about TMJ and thought this maybe related as I read that TMJ could cause headaches too which I get quite a bit. Thank you very much  for explanations and help . rach.atkinson: Another thing to add is I do have like a clicking when I open my mouth wide and I’ve seen this can be related to TMJ too"

Dr M: Good dayA competent regular dentist would be able to perform this extraction without any major issues. honestdoc: Usually the upper wisdom teeth like your case are fairly straight forward with minimal trauma.  1.  The bone around it is thinner and less dense.  2.  Many times the root anatomy as indicated on your x-ray are more fused and less flared (less anchored) due to the lack of space.  3.  The tooth is unopposed (no bottom tooth to subject forces which hardens the bone)  which allows the tooth socket and bone to be less resistant to surgical forces.  Best case scenario, the tooth will roll out gently in 5 to 10 seconds. However, I encounter many dentists who are afraid to touch extractions so hopefully your dentist feels confident with this."

    "dialogue": "Buster: I just got the all on four. I hate my final prosthetic. I feel like the dentist made this and this was not made in a lab.i wish I could get it made somewhere else. What are my options? I got stuck in a bad position my dentist had the dental assistant do you mostly all of my work. She claims she was a dentist in Mexico and went to dental school for one year. This is not what I wanted. I paid 30,000 for this upper and it feels so wrong. honestdoc: Go back and discuss all of your concerns.  You paid a lot of money and the team should make it right.  If you feel that your concerns aren't being addressed, you may consider filing a complaint with the licensing authorities. Buster: This is so hard I don’t even know where to begin  i found a doctor I think is highly educated in implants. we decide to do the all on four on top and remove my two teeth in the very back on the bottom. We also did two implants on the bottom which was another 10,000 on top of the 30,000 for the top. my first appointment the dental assistant did my impression which it was falling out of my mouth and I had to reach up and push it in before I could tell her it was falling. She does another one wasn’t feeling confident. So the next time I see the doctor he removes my teeth and puts in my implants and bone grafts and attaches my temporary. After ‘‘tis point all my future appointments were with a girl from Mexico that practiced there but I don’t believe is licensed here. She said she had to go to to school for a year after she graduated high school to get her license in Mexico. So couple weeks after I get the implants on the top I go to the appointments and the doctor removes my stitches and then places the two implants on the bottom with bone graphs. Is it normal to do that with just numbing medication? Just curious..... also when the doctor put in my temp bridge it was messed up and had to go back to lab and I had to be sedated for a couple extra hours......\nwonder why. when we came out after surgery he said he was sorry my temporary was perfect bad he will make sure my final results are. Time comes for me to get my two teeth on the bottom there were two quarter inch black slashes on the tooth. I asked the dental assistant which is the one who installed them about it she didn’t know. I asked her why would a lab send something like this over here.(paid $5000 for that tooth) she did ask me if I wanted her to grind about it and I was a little disgusted no I was concerned with the integrity of my tooth and my final result. now I’m wondering what type of imaging they’re going to do for my final prosthetic on top. I want to the appointment and once again the dental assistant is doing everything. She has a scannerconnected to a computer screen and is taking images of my  messed up temporary. Then I did an impression of my temporary. Then she had some caulking gun and squiet some purple stuff along my front bite line and that was it. I thought maybe they would take an impression of my gums seeing how they have change so much after surgery. I thought at some point someone would see how my implants are doing the doctor hasn’t looked at them since I got the stitches out. One of them I can wiggle back and forth with my tongue. Are they supposed to be like that? I don’t even know what kind of implants I have or what my teeth are made of. And my permanent all on four feels cheap and poorly made.I don’t feel I can talk to him about this without insulting him. Is there a place where I can go to find out what happened to me where they can check his work out? honestdoc: Implants aren't supposed to move or wiggle with your tongue.  You aren't supposed to get crowns with black slashes.  I don't understand how you can pay so much money and get poor results.  What currency did you pay and what location did you get it done...I'm not understanding any of this. Buster: American currency..... I got it done in northern california. This guy has written books and teaches implants.  The dental assistant plainly saw the black slashes on that tooth when she put it in my mouth. I saw it when I looked in the mirror on the way home the next time I saw her I mentioned it and she said oh yeah I saw that too do you want me to remove it. I just have a feeling they’re making stuff there and acting like they’re working with the a lab. I paid a lot of money for my prosthetic it sure doesn’t look or feel like it. The dentist hasn’t looked at my implants since he took my stitches out. The tooth I can wiggle the implant with my tounge has always been like that it’s never changed. The dental assistant has taken it off and put it back on several times but never touched or inspected the implant. I’m lost, I don’t know how to handle this. Buster: Also that implant is sticking out from the plate and my bottom teeth are using it as a chewing surface. In fact when I close my teeth the implant is the first thing it hits as all my bite seems to be on my front teeth also. honestdoc: I'm sorry to say that implants aren't supposed to be like that.  They should not be movable.  That means the bone did not integrate into the implant which means failure.  The crown should not be biting first.  Implants don't have Periodontal ligaments (shock absorbers for the teeth) and cannot tolerate forces like natural teeth.  The implant team needs to address it...surgical team on integration and restorative team on bite and esthetics.  If not, may need to file complaint with the California Dental Board. Buster: I’m still struggling. I tried going to a perio and getting that implant checked. He took images and said it looked ok and he would not take my piece off and check. I told him how much I paid for this he shook his head and said I need to have a sit down with him. He said he doesn’t know what my teeth are made of. Can you tell me what this is made of? Is this what I paid 30,000 dollars for? It feels horrible and is making my mouth stress a lot. Feeling like I’m loosing facial support in my lower jaw. I thought I was getting new teeth tease feel horrible. Why? Buster: Also when I bite my bottom teeth slide along the back of my front teeth and when it comes to rest it has moved my bottom Jawas for back as it will go. I think this is causing the stress. Also I’m a hairdresser and I know all about body positioning and I think this was caused by taking impressin with me in a laying down position. I told them from the get that something was wrong ther I was cut off and told no that’s your bite. Also I feel my top teeth should be wider than the bottom so it can come around my teeth. It seems off..... sending a pic. Perio also said my lip was trapped. Buster: I want to this dentist because he specializes in implant and has written books and teaches. I paid him upfront (requirement ) and he put my implants in and then turned me over to the dental assistant to do my prosthetic. She went to dental school in Mexico for 1 year After highschool. I stayed in the us to get my teeth done right."

It looks like it's healing but still has some whitish/pink coloration and hasn't fully returned to normal.Is this typical? Does it look concerning based on the photo? Trying to avoid going to the dentist unnecessarily given COVID, but if it should be more healed by now, I'll setup an appointment.Thank you! Dr M: Good dayI am judging my opinion on your photo. Usually after about 2 weeks, your tongue should be almost back to normal. It is a good sign that you are seeing some improvement.\nI am a bit concerned about the white-red lesion you still have in that area. This is a high risk area, and I would still suggest going to a dentist, to have a consult and screening done, on this area specifically. It might be necessary to consider a biopsy to rule out any underlying pathology. MR505: Thanks Dr. M. If I'm going in next week to have some dysplasia removed with a laser by an ENT surgeon, is this something I can have them look at/take care of while I'm in for that? Or would I need to deal with this starting all over (dentist > referral > surgeon, etc)? Dr M: Good dayThey should be able to look at this at the same time.Good luck MR505: Thanks! I'll be sure to point it out.One last question- I've noticed a couple somewhat whitish but mostly fleshy colored small bumps (like 3 or 4 of them) pop up under my tongue in the past week or so. They don't hurt, the only one I kind of feel is in the back side of my tongue. I assumed they might be small canker sores from rubbing against my teeth (I've been looking at my tongue so much lately) or possibly stress related. I realize this isn't much to go off of, but any idea what they could be? Could stress cause something like this?I have had a dentist, an oral surgeon, and an ENT look at my mouth in the past month, so I assume they'd catch anything concerning?I tried taking a photo but it isn't the best. Hope it helps. Dr M: I don't see anything you need to worry about. Might just be some fibrous tissue from rubbing against your teeth. MR505: Thank you! MR505: Dr M said:\t\t\tI don't see anything you need to worry about. Might just be some fibrous tissue from rubbing against your teeth.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nJust wanted to follow up,  the front one in the photo seem to have cleared up. The back one is still there. Not painful, just feel it sometimes when I swallow. Any ideas on what I can do to make it go away? Or just not worry about it?Thanks!Here's a somewhat better photo. Dr M: Good dayDon't worry about it. There is nothing extra you can do. Just observe the area. MR505: Dr M said:\t\t\tGood dayDon't worry about it. There is nothing extra you can do. Just observe the area.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nHello Dr M - I had my operation to remove the dysplasia a couple weeks ago. I noticed that little bump is still at the back of my tongue however. Not sure if it went away and came back or if it hasn't gone away at all. Do you have any recommendations for what could help get rid of it? Should I have it looked at?Thanks! Dr M: Good day,I would not worry too much about that. It might only be a variation of normal anatomy of a papillae or minor salivary gland. It can also be an area of the tongue that is just a bit irritated and enlarged, due to scratching against an area on the adjacent tooth. Observe the area and if ever it becomes larger, then you can have it investigated."

While there was some discomfort while eating the corn, it was not enough to make me stop. Fast forward a few days and the gum behind my front teeth is swollen. I've had the swollen gum for a week now. I was frustrated enough to have a telehealth call with a dentist. He diagnosed me with a traumatic injury to the incisive papilla and gave me a list of foods to not eat, as well as instructions for salt water rinses. Does anyone else have experience with this and can tell me how long it'll last. Dr M: Good dayIt sounds like your dentist gave you good advice. It can take up to 2 weeks for a traumatic injury to heal, depending that there is no further damage to the area. Rinse with the salt water and it should clear up. honestdoc: If you are sure any lesions are from an injury or canker sore, ask the teledentist to prescribe you Kenalog Orabase or in Dental Paste.  In the US, this medicine may not be covered by many insurances because it is considered a luxury to have your wounds heal sooner than without it."

The paper slides right out, how big of a problem is this. Do I have to have the filling redone, will this cause an issue with that tooth or others if i don't? Dr M: Good dayAs long as your occlusion is balanced on both sides, it doesn't matter that the filling doesn't touch. Sometimes this is preferred in order to reduce force on a tooth that could lead to additional fractures of the restoration or if the tooth is symptomatic. due to excessive biting forces.\nIf you start having pain on one or both of your TM- joints or muscles on the sides of your head, go back to your dentist to balance your occlusion."

    "title": "Teeth click especially in the morning",
    "dialogue": "jlr: I'm 54 and have a good dental history, braces growing up, some cavities over the years.  I see my dentist every 6 months, last time in 12/19 due to the pandemic. My dentist always says I have really strong teeth, with mild gum recession. My lower incisors are becoming crooked.Anyway, I recently bought an electric toothbrush, and a week or so after using it my teeth became very sensitive, and my left molars, top and bottom gave me a little pain when biting hard.  But the most disconcerting experience has been that I've noticing my teeth (top and bottom incisors) shift or click very slightly occasionally when I press forward with my tongue, especially after puckering or sucking in.  It's  worse in the morning.  I bought a mouth guard  a few days ago and have been wearing it when I sleep and when I exercise, in case I'm grinding my teeth or clenching.  After a few days of wearing the guard, the sensitivity has gone down, but the clicking is still there, though less in the daytime.I've noticed my teeth click once in a while over the years, but I've never really focused on it, and it seems worse now.  So, I'm a bit worried about it, have read that teeth shift, etc. and my wife says her teeth occasionally do this.  But still, I cannot shake the worry about it as of now. Dr M: Good dayTeeth that click are not normal. Usually teeth have a small amount of physiological movement that can take place, but if you can move it with your tongue, this might be indicative of another underlying condition or bone loss. Over time, if your teeth become more crowded, this could lead to a shift in your occlusion, which could result in grinding. Usually these teeth are more symptomatic in the morning and can be associated with headaches as well. \nI would also be careful with an electric toothbrush. Hard bristles on the head, in combination with toothpaste, can be abrasive. If you are already someone that brushes too hard, you can damage your enamel and expose areas of dentin, which are more prone to sensitivity. Rather stick to a softer toothbrush/head for the electric toothbrush.My main concern would be the grinding. Mouth guards you buy at a pharmacy or drug store aren't always custom made for your specific dentition and thus sometimes don't solve the problem. I would consider getting a custom occlusal guard made by a dentist. If the teeth continue to \"click \", have the dentist check for any cracks or loose fillings in the affected areas, as well as evaluate the bone around those teeth. jlr: Thanks very much for your response, Dr M.  I made an appointment to see my dentist tomorrow."

    "dialogue": "EnamelKing: Hi, \nI have a pretty weird situation. I always have this urge to chew on anything chewable really. Bubble gums are too effortless for me. Pens, pencils, my own fingers etc. Every time I get this chewing fixation, I'd usually go and buy myself a medium-rare sirloin steak. But recently, it has gotten worse. I recently purchased a \"small-dog teething bone\" on Amazon and it reached today. I instantly started chewing on it and felt nice and relaxed. So my questions are:1) Is it weird for a human to want to chew on a dog bone? (just to be clear -not the bone of a dog but a cosmetic/synthetic store-bought bone meant for dogs)\n2) After chewing on it for 10 mins, I feel a slightly gratifying yet weird sensation in my jaws. Should I be worried about harming my jaws?\n3) The bone I bought is intended to be for very small dogs to chew on during their teething phase which means it ultra soft - but still tough enough for humans. Is it okay if I keep chewing on it? A few details about me:\n1) An omnivorous diet (70% meat 30% everything else)\n2) I smoke (there may be a connection)\n3) I'm a 30-year-old male with strong teeth that I generally take care of\n4) I can chew food/fruits/other edible stuff better than other people around me.

Teeth pain can be referred from various locations.  I think you are on the right track in using a bite guard.  If your pain/sensitivity doesn't improve in another week, go back and have the dentist perform tooth sleuth, probe and illumination tests for possible fractures and cold test for any pulpal problems."

I hear some soft sound or music in my right ear whenever I lie down at night. This sound hearing is new and it's been there for a week. Tmj specialist told me to try physical therapy for my tmd.

Sometimes it can be a combination of these. The TMJ specialist will most likely give you examples of exercises that you have to do, in order to focus on certain muscles groups, in order to relieve the pain.

So, I would like to try another treatment. So, going with PT. \nDoes tmd diagnosis require imaging? The tmj specialist did only the pan xray and nothing else. Does the pan xray show the tmd issues? How the diagnosis done? My pan xray shows anything?\nPT did some evaluation hands on  and said I have tmd. My PT said that it will take one or 2 months to see improvement. Apart from trying PT, does night guard helps tmd? Not the mouth appliance which tmj specialist gives,the custom night guard which the regular dentist gives. Dr M: Good dayUsually a panoramic radiograph can be used to visualise the bony components of the TMJ. Sometimes additional imaging such as an open-and closed TMJ radiograph can also be used or advanced imagery such as MRI's or CB-CT scans. \nA night guard can give some relief, it just has to have an adequate thickness in order to relax the involved muscles. If too thin, it is of no use to TMD. The appliance given by the TMJ specialist would be more helpful in this regard I would think, since it is made for TMD."

The idea behind the device came to fruition as a response to Covid-19. It is an attempt to quickly adapt to our current environment by getting dentists and hygienists back to work sooner in a safer environment.Our initial user feedback has revealed a wide range of standard practice and regional restrictions. I wanted to reach out to the community that would use this device for further input to ensure it’s something that fulfills a need, something that you would want, and is something that will improve the safety for you and concurrent patients. For anyone interested, below are some questions that would be helpful to have discussions around:Do you view aerosol production as an obstacle that increases the risk of being exposed to Covid-19 and prevents you from comfortably returning to work?\nWould connecting an additional device through a splitter valve to your operatory’s HVE port be acceptable? In this scenario, only one device that utilizes HVE would be available at a time, but this ensures full evacuation power to the device being used.\nHave you found other devices that are effective at aerosol removal and that you like to use?\nPlease reply here or direct message me if you would like to have any additional conversation.

He brushes twice a day with an electric toothbrush, has 6 month check ups and although eats sweets etc he doesn't eat them to excess. The dentist has told me in the past that it's just the natural colouring of his teeth but it looks so awful that I can't see how this is the case.  His current check up was cancelled because of covid so he's probably 2 months overdue but how can his teeth get so yellow with daily brushing?? Dr M: Good day,Do you have any pictures of his teeth? I would need to distinguish between plaque, which can be brushed away, or calculus, which will need to be removed with a scaler. honestdoc: The erupting adult teeth will look more yellow compared to baby teeth due to the differences in mineral content.  My kids' teeth are that way as the wife was similarly concerned.  The only way to whiten is to bleach them.  I don't recommend doing that at this time because the child is so young.  Bleaching can cause the teeth to be more sensitive and can cause gum and cheek/lip irritation.  I would wait until he is older and his teeth can withstand chemical changes (I don't plan on having my kids doing that at all). honestdoc: harrymiller said:\t\t\tHi! I think your son's enamel is quite weaker or thinner since it is clear that he keeps his teeth clean. It cannot be plaque anyway. I suggest you work on his nutrition schedule like adding more calcium-rich food and watching on oral hygiene moe. These have worked for some kids and helped them improve with their enamel thickness. Teeth-whitening is not something for his age. Try it. I hope it gets better.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nSorry, although your response is good, enamel cannot be thickened or added.  It can only be microscopically strengthened by Fluoride and remineralized by minerals in your saliva.  Child's enamel when the adult teeth first erupts is very vulnerable to acid damage and hopefully have some Fluoride to protect it. Sonia Salamuri: JMum said:\t\t\tMy son (9) has quite thick looking yellow what I assume is plaque on his top and bottom teeth and in between each tooth on the bottom row.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Electric brushes are a good option but sometimes the child needs some help to clean better on the cervical part of the tooth, that is, near the gingiva. Between each tooth, you could help him to use a floss (there are avaible in small sizes with colours for children), to take the plaque (or food) that is difficult to clean,even with the electric toothbrush. After the final rinsing, you can leave some toothpaste in your teeth to help the fluoride action on the enamel, so you can ask your dentist if it is wise to apply a  really tiny amount of toothpaste in your child teeth for the same purpose."

I was wondering if anyone can look at it and just see if they notice any problems.Excuse the deep fillings...they're all from a particularly bad period where I wasn't looking after myself well enough in general! I've got my act together better now.I've been getting pains here and there in the area of the deep fillings but never lasting a long time (but I am also quite congested and have pain in and around my ear on the left side too). The dentist did vitality, pressure and temperature tests on the teeth and they all seemed fine.The dentist said there may be a slight issue with my sinus on the left (said it looks slightly cloudy on the x ray). He said that sinus problems can sometimes cause tooh pain too. Is that right?! honestdoc: Sinus problems may cause pain similar to tooth ache on upper teeth.  Your teeth may feel more pronounced pain when you bend forward to pick up an item or walking up & downstairs.  Many physicians will not take you seriously and have you go to a dentist.  Most likely your teeth with the big fillings are ok since all the testings were normal.  I do see a cavity on LL and LR molar.  Keep in mind the pano x-ray is not very diagnostic for cavities.  Another source of pain could be from grinding and clenching.  You may not be aware you are doing it. Minionfan: Thanks for your response. I will keep an eye on all my teeth.Do the cavities look big? I only had a proper dental appointment with my own dentist (the one 2 weeks ago was a second opinion type appointment) at the end of June and had bitewing x rays taken and there didn't seem to be any problems?! That's a bit worrying if they are.I am aware that I clench my teeth during the day and am trying to stop and reteach myself when I'm doing that. Not sure if I'm doing it during the night. honestdoc: The cavities are on tooth #18 Mesial (towards midline) and #31 Mesial.  They are small to moderate.  I would get them filled before they get bigger.  You cannot teach yourself not to clench.  Consider Over the Counter night guard and really consider the more expensive custom bite guard. Minionfan: Sorry all I was meaning was that when I become aware of clenching my teeth I tell myself to stop it and try and relax my jaw. It's working a bit as i'm a lot more aware than I used to but I'm also well aware it may be happening at night. I'll definitely look into night guards, thanks.\nHow long does it take for cavities to appear?  We're they missed by the dentist do you think or have only happened in the 6 or so weeks since I was there? : -/ honestdoc: It's hard to say.  The pano x-ray does not reveal between teeth well.  I saw black spots on those teeth.  Have your dentist take bitewings for better assessment.  If not, show your dentist those areas from the pano provided because sometimes the bwxs could overlap making it really hard to see. Minionfan: honestdoc said:\t\t\tIt's hard to say.

Sometimes is not easy to clean right the small gaps between those theeth and, if is not well cleaned some decay could developed under the filling. There's a small shadow around it (it could be only a shadow), so, it's not a bad idea to check on that too, if you wan't."

One of the ladies working on my teeth there told me I need to get the two cavities filled before they \"needed to come out.\" I am moving next week, so I have to make an appointment at a new dentist to get the cavities looked at.

I'm looking for thoughts or opinions on how severe the hole looks, I know the picture isn't the best.

I doubt you will have to have the teeth extracted. We don't normally extract front teeth, if there are other options we can consider first.Hope this helps to put your mind at ease a little bit. Sonia Salamuri: I think that Dr M is right. To extract the wisdom tooth I believe you nedeed to make an X-Ray, or maybe a CT, and maybe from there you can have a better view of the cavity in your tooth. Also, the advice for a good hygiene is essential, specialy with the use of floss or small brush to clean between each tooth."

As stated before I can't diagnose based on x-rays and much less without an intact one.  An important factor is swelling indicating infection and failing root canal.  I do see cavities on Lower right and fracture or cavity on LL back molar.  If you need root canal retreatment, I recommend going to a root-canal specialist (endodontist) because a lot of things can go wrong.  However, it can get very costly.  You may consider going to the dental school and maybe faculty practice where there are a lot of resources to meet your needs.

The filling won't be as strong as an onlay (crown) which is more expensive.  You have an existing large silver filling on #18.  After any work on the tooth, it may feel more cold sensitive.

    "dialogue": "InPain56: So I’ve had a pain on the left side of my mouth for while, take ibuprofen and Advil daily to somewhat help it. After I had this X-ray done, my family dentist filled a cavity on the top left of my mouth and pulled the wisdom tooth next to it. The pain has not gone away....... I can’t pinpoint a specific tooth either it’s just a general pain in the back left. Could it be my wisdom tooth on the bottom left? I’m thinking about going to an oral surgeon and getting it removed as well as my other wisdom teeth. Or could it be something else? Dr M: Good dayBased on your x-ray, it does look like your bottom left wisdom is impacted. Sometimes this pain can radiate up to year ear and even cause headaches or earache.\nMy opinion would be to remove the wisdom tooth, as well as the teeth on the right side.\nYou have several other fillings and it is difficult to judge their quality on a panoramic x-ray alone. For this a clinical exam with peri-apical x-rays may be required, since it \" zooms in \" on the area and then it can be seen if there is possible secondary decay. The filling on your upper left also looks quite deep and close to the nerve ( assuming the decay was removed and a new filling was done? ). If it is too close to the nerve or in the nerve, this could also cause pain, even at the bottom, since pain can be referred. Hope this helps"

The stiffness in the jaw is normal after a wisdom tooth extraction, since the muscles in the associated area can be a little bit sore. This can happen due to the extraction procedure itself or even because of the local anaesthetic that was injected into the area.\nFor difficult wisdom teeth extractions, it can take up until 1 month for the hole to close completely as well as any lingering pain or sensitivity to go away.\nMy advice would be to observe the area and to give it some more time.

I really wasn’t even feeling pain in the tooth at the time.. but I had insurance and it was covered. Fast forward to now It started hurting when I chewed anything. Then about 4 days later I bit on a peanut and my tooth broke off.\nI went to another dentist because I had a horrid exp with my old one and he said he said he doesn’t know if it was the tooth or the filling that cracked. He recommended a root canal and crown. He also mentioned that he wasn’t sure if the crack when down past the gum line. I got the root canal.. but still felt pain. I went back and got multiple xrays and they said “it’s fine, maybe food irritating the gum” so I got the got the crown placed hoping that would help prevent this “irritation from food”. It’s been maybe a month or so. And I still have the intermittent discomfort/pain on the same side that the tooth chipped on. I floss 3x daily to fish for food under there. It still hurts. I’ve been searching on google and saw things like hairline fracture etc and it confident that’s what I have now. Prior to getting the root canal, the tooth would only hurt if I bit on it and let go. I don’t want to consistently take nsaids for a tooth that I’ve paid almost $4000 total for (including the first onlay) \nWhat do I do? Are they going to have to extract the tooth? Should they have extracted the tooth when I went to them in the first place instead of pushing for a root canal? Am I gonna have to pay for an implant at only 23?!! Can I get a refund on the prior treatments on the tooth? I’m just so lost and annoyed and also tired of spending money for no results Dr M: Good dayUsually if a crack was seen, it is important to follow the crack in order to determine how deep it goes. If it was superficial, the root canal and crown should have solved the problem-keeping in mind that a root canal has various factors that also determine if it was successful or not.\nIf the crack goes into the pulpal floor or root of the tooth, the tooth usually gets extracted, since it is deemed unrestorable. \nAfter a root canal has been completed, there can be some residual sensitivity for a time, but this should gradually decrease.\nI usually don't place crowns on symptomatic root canals if I am not sure the root canal was successful.\nIt might be best to get a second opinion, maybe from an endodontist, which is a specialist in root canal treatments. He can evaluate the root canal that has been done, to see if there was any canals missed or roots that has been short filled, and then possibly re-do the root canal through the crown if this is the case.\nHe also has sophisticated technology, to determine if there is a crack ( cbct scans and/or microscopes ) and can then determine if the tooth is worth spending money on or not.Hope this helps a little bit."

It could be more pronounced after medication due to changes in your body's autoimmune system.  Medications could cause dry mouth and rubbing your tongue could also make it more sensitive.  I would not use peroxide, mouth rinse, or harsh toothpastes due to their chemical irritation.  If appropriate, have your dentist prescribe you Kenalog in Dental Paste (very expensive in the US not usually covered by most insurances) to apply on sore spots."

Any ideas on what I can do? Dr M: Good dayTo have an abscess on a tooth for so long is never a good idea. The abscess can enlarge and spread to adjacent teeth or spaces and can even become life threatening. A chronic source of infection, also strains your immune system, in a time where you need it to combat other viruses.\nMy opinion would be to get some antibiotics as soon as you can, or to remove the tooth.

I've actually noticed one of my molars looks like the gum above it has receded cause the root looks visible!The pain is ONLY when i push against the gum above the teeth, when drinking cold drinks, the molar that looks to have receded (middle tooth in the red circle) is extremely sensitive, and sensitive to cold air.Last time I went to my dentist about this issue with another tooth, (gum pain, sensitivity - but no receding) it was an immediate root canal they done. Does it look and sound like this may be the case again?**Last time I had an X-ray on all my teeth I got told I have short roots to begin with, but upon researching, this is a side effect of having braces I think Dr M: Good dayThe sensitivity you experience might be because of the exposed root surface due to the gum recession in that area. The fact that you experience pain when pressing on the tooth, is a bit worrying. This might be an indication of infection around the roots of the tooth or the tooth might also have some underlying bone loss in that area, causing the tooth to be a little bit mobile leading to the pain. Either way, a x-ray will be needed to give a proper diagnoses. It is best that you visit the dentist so he can do a full examination."

I'm thinking I might have just bit it but want to be sure I am not overlooking anything more serious. Thank you! Dr M: Good morningThe issue might be trauma related due to tongue biting or even a sharp filling on one of your molars. I would suggest leaving the area for about 7-10 days, maybe just rinsing with luke-warm salt water to clean the area. If the lesion does not disappear, then it might be a good idea to go to your dentist to get it checked out. The lateral or side border of the tongue is a high risk area of possible pathology.

Is this something that would be caught by a decent doctor?No fillings either, thankfully. I'm hoping a few days of warm salt water and it'll be gone. Dr M: Good day,I would rather go to a dentist, since some general practitioners might miss the issue. Give it time, and if it doesn't disappear, go see a dentist and mentioned the tongue lesion. A dentist will then evaluate the lesion and send you to an oral surgeon for further examination if he deems it necessary. This specialist will be fully capable to diagnose and manage the problem, since this is his area of expertise. MR505: Thanks for the follow up. The past month I've seen a dentist, an oral surgeon, and today was the ENT (have another issue being resolved). I'm hoping with all those people looking in my mouth and at my tongue, they'd have noticed it. Either way, I'll keep my eyes on it and reach out to my dentist again if it doesn't go away. Thanks! honestdoc: The tongue has a lot of anatomic blood supply which could be both good and bad.  The good is the blood supply provides repair nutrients for efficient healing during acute one-time trauma.  The bad is the blood supply acts like a busy freeway for cancer/tumor cells to spread elsewhere.  When the mouth (tongue) experiences constant irritation and trauma like rubbing on sharp rough surfaces, it wants to protect itself by making abnormal thicken skin (hyperkeratinization) or callouses.  It is rare that this will progress into cancer but it is precancerous.  Couple that with chemical irritation like smoking and alcohol, you increase the chance for out-of-control abnormal cell growth.  The key is to not have any irritation. MR505: It seems like it's healing already, thankfully. I don't smoke (ever) and I only drink socially. What sort of irritation should I look for? Would just a normal tooth do it?Also, are you seeing hyperkeratosis or just mentioning it? honestdoc: I couldn't see it on the images.  Make sure your teeth don't feel rough or sharp.  Sometimes with dental work and or wear can cause sharp and rough surfaces.  Occasional alcohol shouldn't be a problem.  I don't like mouth rinses but many modern rinses are alcohol free. MR505: Is it something a dentist would see in a normal examine or do I need to ask specifically - both for hyperkeratosis and if my teeth are sharp? They don't feel particularly sharp but I'm not positive. honestdoc: The dentist will need to check it during routine periodic exam.  Many times it may appear normal so ask you dentist to look into it."

Drilling 4.times to clean it up and it got healed.Also there were a jaw disk displacement during removal of tooth and it end up on wearing braces. I've finally got after long search great orthodontist.

I know it is complex, and hat's why I am trying this forum guy's.\nHuge thank you! Dr M: Good day,It sounds like you have a very complex case and it is difficult to give an exact opinion without any related x-rays or scans.\nAfter nerve damage it is possible that you might be suffering from neuralgia, depending on how bad the damage was and this can continue for years. Usually an oral surgeon would prescribe some medication you can take to alleviate this.\nIt is also very important to note that in the beginning phase of orthodontic treatment, the teeth are sometimes a bit painful, due to the forces exerted on them as well as the movement they are undergoing.\nThis usually clears up at a later stage.\nMy advice would be to monitor this pain and maybe mention this to the specialist, which will advise you if any further investigations are needed. degerardo: Hello, thank you very much for your reply. I thought so as well. But I am not sure anymore.\nDo you guys think that tooth 4.weeks after root canal can be still sensitive to pain from braces as well? Also with the healing wound? Is it possible that braces are moving soft tissue (gums) and it is painful? \nThank you so so much for all answers. Dr M: Good dayTeeth are moved through a process of inflammation. Usually during the first few weeks of orthodontic treatment you can have various teeth that are painful, including the soft tissue.\nIt is completely possible that the pain is from the orthodontic treatment."

It might be that you are only noticing it now. Dr M: if you are worried about your bite, maybe let your dentist have a look. If a malocclusion is present, this can sometimes be fixed with minimal or specialized orthodontic treatment."

    "dialogue": "thatman: I think I may have stopped grinding but I want to know how I would know when I wear a mouth guard when I'm sleeping? Dr M: Good dayA mouth guard is usually given to alleviate symptoms associated with grinding such as headaches and muscle spasms etc. To evaluate if the teeth are okay, you will have to go for follow up visits with your dentist, to monitor tooth surfaces. This happens over a period of months. If you feel some relief with regards to symptoms , then usually this is a good sign. Keep in mind, that mouth guards will need to be replaced every year or two, depending on the severity of your grinding, since you can grind through your guard."

I have been to oral surgeon and he took CT/pan xray before the wisdom tooth removal. I removed it ten days back. Went for a follow up. Took another CT scan to check if everything is ok. So, totally many CT scan,pan x-ray and bite wings and periapical xrays in a month. I feel so nervous about it. Is it harmful?\nMy OMFS told me to go to TMJ specialist to check out.  here all offices take own x-rays. So, if i go to TMJ specialist, they will take another x-ray or cbct scan. So all these images within a month. Is it harmful?? Please help. i didn't injure anywhere in jaw.had some soft foods chewed more than usual on 3rd week of may.

    "dialogue": "Craig: I have had an infected wisdom tooth for about six months, finally able to have it extracted (hospital) in a couple of weeks. Firstly, once it is removed, will the chronic infection in the bone resolve spontaneously? Secondly, the crown of the tooth broke two days ago, so will the removal of the root be more difficult in any way, given it is obviously a fragile tooth?\nThanks in advance for your advice. honestdoc: Yes, once the removal of the source of infection (tooth), the bone and gums should heal.  If the crown of the tooth broke leaving only the roots, it can be more difficult to remove.  Usually when you have an infection, the bone around the infected tooth and roots are softer and it usually comes out fairly easy."

Usually the safest time for an extraction is during the 2nd trimester, but if the risk of leaving the tooth, poses a greater risk to the baby, and especially if the antibiotics didn't relieve the pain, it might be best to remove the tooth.

    "dialogue": "Minionfan: What are the main symptoms/signs of TMJ and how is it diagnosed and treated? honestdoc: Temporomandibular Disorder TMD usually presents as pain and lack of function (unable to open wide).  Many times TMD can be symptom-free (no pain, no limitations) but your dentist may detect severe or uneven wear on your teeth.  It can be like malfunctioning brake calipers in your car where the brake pads are prematurely engaged and wearing abnormally.  TMD can be serious enough that the bone around the joint will wear each other down (arthritis).  The dentist and or TMJ specialist may order imaging such as MRI and CT scan to view the joint anatomy.  Many times, the dental pano x-rays may reveal flattening of the mandibular condyles indicating abnormal wear/damage.  Treatment may include bite and or stabilization splints, physical therapy, and surgery (last resort due to its invasive nature and unpredictable results).  My asymptomatic TMD started during a friendly pickup basketball game over 30 years ago and had my Right jaw nailed by an aggressive elbow and dislocated the Right TMJ.  With stress of Dental School and being a dentist, I was grinding and clenching and had uneven wear on my posterior teeth.  Fortunately I prescribed myself a custom bite guard and relieved headches and random teeth pain.  I still have risk for arthritis and if my condition worsens, I will see a TMJ specialist. Minionfan: Thanks very much for your reply.A few months ago I went through a period where my jaw would lock open or closed, so made eating and talking difficult when it happened. I'd also hear a noise in my ear beforehand as if it were a spring being wound and then the jaw would lock for a few seconds/a minute or two etc.The locked jaw hasn't happened recently but at the moment I have a regular ache in my jaw but when I went to the dentist a couple of weeks ago there were no fillings etc needed to explain any ache. It also hurts sometimes when I open my mouth wide.I also currently have pain in/around my ear, although that isn't unusual as I've always had a lot of ear infections and ear problems.I also clench/grind my teeth when I feel stressed, although I'm trying to recognise when I'm doing it and to stop as much as possible.Does this sound like it could be a TMJ issue?

    "dialogue": "Du_deleted: Hi,\nI have been dealing with jaw pain and swelling for almost one and a half months. Had sinus infection and ear infection and assumed this jaw pain is because of sinus. Took antibiotics and sinus cleared. But this jaw pain and swelling still there.  I went to ENT and cleared that no sinus and ear infection. Then went to the dentist and he told x-rays and said no infection seen since I took antibiotics already, he couldn't see any infection in any tooth. Did bite test and said I might have crack or fracture on first molar. Went to an Endo and he said no fracture and might be a minor crack and told me to get a crown. I said I have bad pain everyday and he said I can go for RCT if pain is worse. My pain is not on the cracked tooth. It's on upper jaw, low jaw, ear pain and under the ear. Top of the neck. All places swollen. Lymph nodes under the ear on top of the neck is swollen too. I went to an oral surgeon and he said my upper WT is hitting the lower gum. I don't have WT on lower. It's remobed already. So I need to remove it and I also have some hard clicking and snapping. So he prescribed some muscle relaxant and ibprufen 800.I am taking it for a week and still the pain is throbbing. It's throbbing pain in the upper jaw, ear, neck, lymph nodes, under the ear. All looks swollen. I thought of waiting till the pain subsides to extract this WT. Looks like it getting worse. I couldn't bare the pain. Don't know if it's TMJ issue or sinus issue or WT issue. The lower end jaw under the ear and top of the neck is hurting a lot. Throbbing continuously. I am meeting my dentist tomorrow. he said he will look into my bite using intra oral scanner and check the bite and to see how hard I am biting.I am also thinking to take out the WT tomorrow. Hope the OS office will gave some urgent openings. Any of you done like that? How to be ready for that? What we need to know before going for WT removal? My neck is hurting a lot from yesterday. Ibprufen doesn't help at all.  I am planning for only local anesthesia and don't want to sleep during procedure. Anyone did that before?Will they remove the tooth with pain and swelling? Or we have to wait till it subsides??Anyone had neck pain on that side with WT pain? It's throbbing inside the ear, right side neck, low end jaw under the ear. I am hoping it's from WT.

    "dialogue": "itsthat24: Hello,Apologies for the multiple images, I've kinda been saving up things I've noticed over the past 6 months in mouth that don't quite seem normal, and it's been worrying me a bit. I plan to see a dentist as Covid restrictions reduce, but I'm not sure if they'll be so willing to go over my list of problems!I'm a 23 year old male and I'd say I've been a light user of e-cigarettes (juul) in the past few years, and it's the biggest worry that it might've caused some of these problems. I have 1/4 wisdom teeth through (top left) and the others are barely visible out - from my research I know these can cause issues.I'd appreciate any feedback on the following things I've picked up on, and also anything you may pick up on.First of all, on the roof of my I have these two white patches - are these normal? \nSecond, I have two thick red lines; these are painless but look a bit irritated. \nThese two (above) I've noticed recently and am not sure when they appeared.Third, I have a patch of white bumps which cause no pain, but I can feel them with my tongue and feel similar to an ulcer. These have been here for 6+ months and are the most worrying of the issues. These are on my right cheek, which is the side where no wisdom teeth have protruded yet \nFourth, I'm not really sure what this is, I can feel a little bump with my tongue but it's fairly hard to see - could this be some kind of scar from biting perhaps; and below that there's a larger lump that I think may be wisdom related \nFinally, does this lighter patch of my gum look normal? I frequently have a dry mouth which I know is a side effect of e-cigarettes, usually worse in the morning sometimes associated with a strange dry taste. I worry this could be some kind of gum disease.\nApologies again for the image dump, but I'd greatly appreciate any feedback or anything I should be worried about.Thanks honestdoc: First off, can you get off the vaping?  Although there is no long-term studies with vaping, many sources report health hazards.  The bump on the roof of your mouth appears to be palatal bony tori.  The bony tori looked a little irregular and asymmetric which we prefer to look regular and symmetric indicating slow, controlled growth if any.    It's hard for me to pin point the bumps on the back.  Most likely they are minor salivary glands that may be irritated or inflammed from the chemical irritation of vaping.We cannot diagnose any lesion without biopsy.  Since biopsy can be traumatic and expensive (cutting the lesion and preparing it to look under the microscope by experts) it usually is reserved for likelihood of tumor or cancer.  Get off the Vaping...I know it is easier said than done.  I had an unfortunate lady come in with swollen face & numb lip 3 yrs ago.  She had no teeth and upon xray, the massive cancerous tumor invaded the left swollen side and separated (fractured) the thin toothless jaw bone.  She probably had less than 2 weeks to live. itsthat24: honestdoc said:\t\t\tFirst off, can you get off the vaping?

The first step would be to consciously recognize the habit and then try to break this habit by actively thinking about what you are doing. This can take up to 1 month to do, sometimes longer.\nIf this doesn't work, I would suggest maybe getting an occlusal guard made, that will protect your teeth at night when you are sleeping in order to prevent damage to them.\nYou can also consider seeking the advice from an orthodontist, who might have some removable appliance that can assist with breaking this habit. honestdoc: You may consider having a TMJ specialist evaluate your condition.

Although it is not painful to eat, seconds after finishing eating this sensation is heightened.  I have taken various medication (gabapentin etc}, had numerous kinds of x ray and have been told my teeth are ok.

I have had regular appointments at a Dental Hospital, the Consultant has now told me there is nothing he can do. Please Please is there anyone out there that can help. I'm now finding it difficult to cope. honestdoc: This is difficult to analyze your problem.  Possibilities are you may have sinus pain that mimics upper teeth pain.  How you know is if your pain is more pronounced when you bend forward and walk up & downstairs.  With all the medications you are taking, you may experience dry mouth which can be very uncomfortable.  You maybe grinding/clenching you teeth which can stress your teeth and TMJ.  With your lips tingling, you may be experiencing a nerve problem. MattKW: Sounds neuoropathic, and that's why they've tried the gabapentin. Either dentally or neurologically it's odd that both sides are hurting.\nSo I assume you've been to the dentist, endodontist, and neurologist to end up in this situation? Is there any sort of facial pain clinic where you live? They won't necessarily be able to get rid of the pain, but they can help you manage it. I don't know if you'd be suitable for some type of permanent nerve block - getting out of my depth here. Joan Palmer: Yes I have seen them all, also had ENT check to eliminate sinus issues.  I have also seen a psychologist to help manage the pain but everything that is suggested I am doing already. I am on no medication at present as nothing worked.  I wear a splint at night which does ease the pain and oddly enough chewing gum helps the pain too. It seems gentle pressure, even with holding a finger on the teeth helps Busybee: It sounds as though you have a trapped nerve.  Have you tried physiotherapy?   I am not an expert but if you find relief by both chewing and pressing on the area then this sounds like the same interference when touching certain pressure points.  So you may benefit from something like deep tissue accupressure as it could be that your muscles are in spasm due to the change in bite and that this is causing pressure on the nerves.   When you are chewing that changes the height of the jaw because you have food between your teeth.  So the collapse of the jaw appears to be causing the problem with the nerve.    Our muskulo skeletal system is no different to a building.  Take away a storey and you end up with instability and pain. MattKW: I'm sorry, I cannot offer further suggestions. You sound like you are in the best possible hands, despite the fact that nothing has been found as a cause. Unfortunately, medicine and science don't yet have the answer to every ailment or the appropriate treatment. I would be very wary of trying any other treatment without discussing with your treating doctors first - you may cause other problems and confuse the issue even more. lolzita: Atypical odontalgia... Read Sarno/Ozanich's books on TMS MattKW: Atypical odontalgia - which really means we don't know. Any symptom we don't fully understand yet goes under the heading of atypical, but that doesn't help the OP. As for TMS, unscientific twaddle of a pet hypothesis. lolzita: TMS is definitely not a hypothesis. Psychosomatic pain can cause any type of pain in the body and make you feel like it has a physical cause. I agree atypical odontalgia is a term used by dentists that just means \"nothing physical\" can be found. Therefore the psychological approach needs to be looked at.Trust me, I just went through the whole ordeal for the past 2 years. I had extreme dental nerve pain (pins and needles, burning, numbness) in my front teeth. I tried everything and wasted my time and money for way too long, MRI, Xrays, ENT, TMJ, Neurologists, Acupuncture, 4 different dentists. I took a tone of meds (benzos, gabapentin, and even opioids). But nothing worked.I healed myself completely in a matter of months with the TMS method. Phantom tooth pain, tingling lips, burning gums and the fact he doesn't have pain while he eats but returns right after.. all are a clear giveaways for TMS. That is EXACTLY what I had. What does OP have to lose?OP send me a PM if you want and I'll guide you to your healing the way I did Busybee: Pardon me, but the idea that dental pain is psychological is a poor excuse when medics cannot find or understand the cause.   I went through the ordeal of this nonsense but all I needed were a few adjustments after poor quality dental work.   It's used as a go to by some dentists when they reach a dead end.    The fact is that true psychosomatic dental pain is incredibly rare.  Most dental pain which appears to have no cause is just a combination of variables that are very difficult to pinpoint. lolzita: Ok then tell me what type of dental issue causes tingling/burning type of sensation\n all the way into the lips and cheeks? OP is not describing a traditionnal type of dental pain.To me that’s the trigeminal nerve acting up. A neurologist could determine what’s going on better than a dentist. I don’t buy the whole “pinched nerve” theory. There so much dentists/neurologists can do based on Xrays/MRIs. If they come out clear then what? Busybee: A trigeminal nerve problem is not psychosomatic.  There is simply insufficient understanding of the link between the teeth, the bite, the posture and the nervous system.   This is because it is impossible to form a good study method when there are so many variables as everyone has a different physiology in combination of these elements. lolzita: Sorry to be insisting but I'm the living proof that it can be. Any type of nerve pain can be psychosomatic including Trigeminal neuralgia. I'm not saying that it's always the case. But it definitely shouldn't be ruled out, unless you don't want to heal.When a neurologist diagnosis you with Trigeminal neuralgia, they'll usually simply tell you nothing can be done and that you'll live with it for the rest of your life. They will also put you on pills like gabapentin or other crap nerve meds that don't work. I'm sorry but that is the alternative.But I agree with you that there are a ton of variables involved and that the face is probably one of the most complex part of the body with the brain. Busybee: I had trigeminal neuralgia which resolved after three or four months.    Most such conditions do resolve over time.  Some are unlucky and have a chronic problem.    I think mine was linked to the bite because it was around the same time as I first noticed a clicky jaw.    Stress can make you grind more or clench more or hunch your shoulders but the pain (in all but a tiny minority of cases) is caused by a physical source.   Mine may have been triggered by a poorly made night guard.  Your body and jaw can re-align and rebalance itself over time.  Teeth move over time.  We don't fully understand the nature of pain but when I looked into this a couple of years ago, it turns out that psychosomatic pain is rare. I really do wish there were more specialists covering the whole area crossing over from dental to neuro to orthopaedics and muskuloskeletal.    Unfortunately the body is treated like a car going into the mechanics.   The bite \"specialists\" I have met don't really seem to be any more clued up than general dentists.   As for neurologists, don't even start me on that topic. lolzita: I agree 100% Robert Bailey: lolzita said:\t\t\tTMS is definitely not a hypothesis.

    "title": "Prep for a new crown on 18 month old root canal",
    "dialogue": "davexnet: Hello\nI had a root canal done on bottom tooth, far left, about 18 months ago.\nIt was successful, I've had no problems with tooth, but for various reasons I left it open\n(uncrowned) until 3 weeks ago.I have some questions about the treatment I received prior to this tooth being ready to\ntake a fresh imprint for the new crown.First of all, a lot of material was removed from the inside of the tooth, it was almost hollowed out.\nSo much so that it had to be replaced with the hardening resin.  Tooth \"basically rebuilt\"  (his words)\nWhen I was asked about why this was done, the answer was not satisfactory (convincing) to me,\nblaming the other doctor from 18 months ago who did the root canal (who has been in business\nfor years) - In fact, now, I'm considering calling the root canal doctor to get his thoughts on the matter.Secondly, some kind of string was pushed down into the gum all the way around .\nHe sure pushed it in deep.  When I asked about it, he said it had something to do with the \nbleeding.  This explanation, again, left me slightly uneasy.  I'm not even sure if this string was removed.Thirdly, about two weeks later, the final crown was installed everything OK.\nThey wanted to, and did, take one more x-ray of the tooth at this point.  I asked about it,\nI said \"Is there something else wrong there\" -  the assistant just mumbled something about they wanted to make sure\nthe glue was cleaned up properly.  I've never heard this, I've had crowns before, never an x-ray at the end.Something about this whole thing is worrying me.  Any thoughts or reassurance?\nThanks Dr M: Good day1) Depending on the amount of tooth structure that was left after the root canal was completed, the dentist might have needed to build up the tooth, to create a core onto which the crown could hold on to. Sometimes after a root canal has been completed, and there isn't enough tooth structure left ( note tooth structure and not filling ) , we place a post and core in order to create better retention for the crown. This might entail a pin like structure that was placed into one or more roots and then a core of filling material( metal or resin ) around that, which would create a larger area for the crown to hold on to.2) The string like structure the dentist placed around the tooth, is called retraction cord, and this is used commonly in cases where the gum is either to close to the margins of the crown prep, which might influence the impression detail, or to control bleeding around the margins, since fluid ( blood or saliva or water ) can influence the detail of the impression, which might lead to less accurate fit of the crown, if not controlled correctly. This is normal in certain situations.3) It is very important to take a post op x-ray of the crown after it is placed, to ensure accurate fit and seal and to make sure there is no excess cement in between the crown tooth and adjacent teeth. Excess cement could lead to inflammation, food traps and this could lead to eventual crown or tooth loss.Hope this helps"

I have to see my dentist for the implant crown.What confused me is that the surgeon said he will order the materials and I will pick-up and taken it to the dentist. I am not sure what materials go to the dentis honestdoc: Usually the surgeon's office send the implant parts (screws, impression copings, etc) to your dentist's office.  We don't like for patients to touch them because any missing pieces can be a headache and waste of time to recover. MattKW: Usually I order all the components myself so the details appear on my invoices for my records, and for the patient. Unfortunately had to do this when one lab I dealt with tried to give me a cheaper copy. honestdoc: It is important for the dentist, surgeon and yourself to keep records of the parts because if you were to have problems with your implant and go to another dentist or that dentist & surgeon retired, moved, etc., the parts information will save everyone a lot of trouble.

Thanks in advance for any advice given! honestdoc: Appears like pericoronitis.  Your 2nd molar looks partially impacted.  Usually the tooth erupts when you're 12.  Try to go to the dentist for options like referral to orthodontist to upright the molar and maybe a prescription of Peridex 0.12% rinse for 2 to 4 weeks.  Don't go beyond since it can darken your teeth."

I avoided eating on that side past 2 days. today I see some swelling on the end of the right down side.its close to my ears and end of the jaw. I have already taken wisdom tooth on the lower side and upper wisdom tooth is still there. I have bad breadth and smells very bad. the Swelling is at the end of the lower jaw. does it related to any tooth or sinus issue?I have sinus issue and never had any swelling like this before. I am in US.  what could be the issue? upper wisdom tooth has small cavity. Lower ones doesn't have any cavity as per last x-ray. The swelling is little but feels very uncomfortable inside the mouth. But not very continuous pain in the tooth. I am able to eat and drink hot liquids. What could be the reason? The little swelling is on the upper and lower jaw side. Exactly under the ears.

I removed my both lower wisdom tooth a decade back. \nYesterday, since I had swelling my husband checked all of my tooth on the right side if any gums are red in color. And he said he can see something like white spots on that spot where I had wisdom tooth before.

Whether we get the tooth back?\nAlso, I have TMJ problem I think. I haven't diagnosed yet. My dentist once told me that I am grinding my teeth a lot during sleep and he can see the edges. \nI hear some popping , stretchy sound whenever I open my mouth and swallow something. honestdoc: Your wisdom teeth won't grow back.  You may be experiencing stress and grinding and clenching.  That could deteriorate your TMJ.  In the US, dentists are opening up.  I have been seeing emergencies only since the closures so you should find a dentist to get it checked.  You could go to the drug store and pick up an OTC night guard and try it out.

Am not planning for any new treatments during this covid crisis. \nI didn't check with my dental office yet. They were closed till may 1st. I have to call them and check.  My pain is mostly inside the ear from yesterday. And also near the lower jaw end under the ears. My ear is completely blocked and scratchy pain all the time. I am not sure if it's dental or sinus or ear issue. Thank you!! Du_deleted: Just an update here. I have the same ear pain, lower jaw pain, swelling under the ear and top of the neck area along with nose and ear congestion. Finished the amoxicillin antibiotics 2 weeks back. I have severe ear and jaw pain with swelling. So, I  went to an ENT today to check if it's ear or sinus issue. I thought of checking with ENT before going to a dentist. I told them the history. I am prone to cold , sinus infection and strep throat throughout the year. I get almost one infection in 2 or 3 months. So I told them about that too. I have not tested any allergies before.ENT checked my ears with an otoscope and did nasopharyngoscopy with Endo to check my sinus. He said my ears are completely fine and no sign of any infection. He said my sinus also looks clear and no pus.He said may be the swelling a secondary infection from sinusitis or TMJ. He was not sure. He told me to get an x-ray and CT scan after 2 weeks just to check if any infection present. He prescribed cefdinir for 2 weeks.The doctor was not sure why I have the jaw pain and the swelling. My sinus and ear is clear now as per the scope examination. He prescribed the antibiotics for 2 weeks and imaging after that.It could be TMJ or any tooth issue? I don't have any gum redness. \nI have called my dentist today to check this out. He is booked up today and till July 2nd. So they put me with another dentist tomorrow. I am planning to go in and check this out. I don't know if I am assumed this swelling as ear and sinus pain so far(more than 3 weeks).  I am going to the dentist tomorrow. This is going to be a new dentist and I am not sure how he is going to check. \nWhat should I ask for? Just posting here to get some information on hand. Do I need to ask for full mouth panaromic x-ray? Or normal x-ray? What else do we need to check since this involves my jaw area under he ear. Please help if you have any inputs. Thank you. honestdoc: I'm suspecting TMJ problem.  Have the dentist clear you of any dental problem.  If you have medical insurance, it may cover TMJ treatments because dental doesn't.  After getting cleared by your dentist, get referred to TMJ specialist and inquire about accepting your insurance because treatment can be very costly.

Most common are bite appliances and physical therapy.  Alternative may be acupuncture.  Last resort may be surgery but it is too traumatic and the results are unpredictable (I would avoid it almost totally).  I wouldn't wait too long because your TMJ can further deteriorate.

I also told them I did chew some meat and fish hard before all this happened. I also hear a big snap or click from the jaw. Like a knuckle the next day. After that, swelling started with pain.followed by ear pain, jaw clicks while opening. They did check my bite with blue color stick(I think bite stick) and asked if I have any discomfort. I feel tender when I bite on tooth#30. He checked for few more times and that feels so tender. So he said I might have a fracture in that root. And he told me to get a CT scan for that tooth to check a clear picture. I asked if it could be a TMJ problem or jaw bone issue or jaw fracture problem. He said that doesn't look like jaw issue. And they said if it's jaw issue or TMJ, I won't get swelling under the ear and the jaw line.  I insist them to take panaromic x-ray just to check the jaw. Then he said ok. I had both pan and CT scan for that tooth. I am yet to receive the xray pictures from their office. I will share it here once I receive my email. \nAfter the CT scan, he said that it's predictable or not predictable. He couldn't see much of a crack or root fracture in the tooth. And guessing there might be a fracture and told me that either I have to extract the tooth or root canal with crown. \nBut he insist me that it's a trial and error. Even after root canal, it might give you the same pain. Then we have to extract it.  So, it's better to extract in the first place and do implant immediately. I was so shocked to hear these and completely blanked out. I don't have any idea how root canal or extraction will be. I would be happy if he said the answers conclusive. Not by a guess. Do the tooth crack or root fracture doesn't show up in x-ray or CT scan??? \nI asked if it works for wait and watch approach. He said I have to do it within a week. I have already delayed this because of assumption of ear,  sinus infection and he is surprised that it doesn't hurt me more all these days. He said it will hurt more if untreated. So, I have to decide if I have to do root canal or extraction on tooth 30. But I don't have any throbbing pain or gum redness or swelling inside on that tooth before I go in for a visit. I totally didn't think about that could be an issue. And about my upper wisdom tooth, in the xray the root color was black. So the dental assistant told me that root is getting there. Since I had already taken antibiotics in the past weeks, the dentist said he couldn't see any infection in any of the tooth in the x-ray. So, he also told me to take out the wisdom tooth #1. I am ok to take that. But I am thinking if I should take off #30. Whether the lower jaw pain, ear pain and swelling could be of wisdom tooth pain or infection. Since I taken antibiotics, that might be resolved. Is that possible??Will the upper wisdom tooth cause swelling on the lower jaw?? Any inputs?The dentist whom I saw today is new to the dental practice and he has been \npractising for an year. He asked one of his colleagues for an opinion and she also said the same after reviewing the CT scan. Whether fracture of tooth or root not shown in the images??Sorry for long post. Thanks for reading. I just want to be as detailed as  possible. honestdoc: Attach the x-rays like pano and periapical.  The CT image may not accurately depict any fractures.  It is very difficult to detect fractures.  Using the tooth sleuth, you bite down, ease firm and let go.  When it hurts when you let go indicates possible fracture.  Another test is the gum probings.  The probings will have normal readings until a sharp drop in deep probing indicating attachment damage.  Did the dentist do a cold test on #30?  I would not do RCT and or extraction unless it is absolute which I  think they were more or less guessing. Extracting #1 is fairly minimal trauma so that shouldn't be a big deal.  TMJ may have some swelling depending on the amount of damage.  If the swelling is away from the ears under the jaw line, it may be coming from the tooth. Du_deleted: Thank you @honestdoc.\nI had the following x-rays today. I will send the images once I receive from their office.\n1. intraoral - periapical first radiographic image\n2.intraoral - periapical each additional radiographic\n3. panoramic radiographic image (no charge)\n4. 3D Cone Beam capture lim FOV #30they did bite test. I don't know if he did gum probing. He did scratch my gums with some metal thing and that was painful. He go over the gum lines and checked. It was very painful for me. Like scratching the gum edges. He didn't do cold water test.is that necessary to find the cracks or fractures?I do have swelling under the ear. And also under this tooth too. The whole lower jaw area. In this tooth #30, I have some tenderness and shoot pain from this afternoon. Don't know if it's because of that gum probing which he did in the office. I also have shooting pain from upper wisdom tooth. Feel shooting and sharp pain in tooth#1 and 30. If I touch the bottom or gum area on tooth 30, it's so tender and painful. I have to press it hard with my finger to feel tenderness.it gives a shooting pain on the bottom of that tooth in the jaw outside( the cheek.)  He is not very absolute in his answer. He is very sure to say trial and error. I want to know if it's from TMJ issue.  He said it's not. I am not sure why I have pain under the ear with swelling. I do have swelling on #30 tooth cheek side. So, don't know what's the issue. Whether crack and fracture will give swelling all over the jaw? He did say that my jaw looks fine from the pan\nx-ray. It's so painful and I am continuing the antibiotics and anti inflammatory for pain. I think I have to go for a second opinion or to an endodontist to get consult. Will share the x-rays as soon as I receive. Their office is already closed and I can catch them up only on Monday. Meanwhile, how do I control the pain and swelling? What is the normal treatment for the fracture? I asked the dentist if I can wait and watch? He said I should do extraction or RCT in one week. I am so confused and worried. I never done RCT before. There is not even a big cavity in that tooth. I don't know how this crack or fracture happened. Thanks. honestdoc: Without images, its like driving to a new location without a map.  The x-ray will not indicate anything but a baseline.  It will not diagnose or pinpoint any details unless obvious in which your dentist will see it.  Your dentist would have detected any bone disease or defects.  In order to diagnose a fracture, there are illuminating tests where the dentist use a high powered lighting unit used to cure white fillings.  Sometimes an internal crack will show up sometimes not especially if it's down in the roots.  Tooth sleuth (bite test) is used on each tooth cusp and after you bite down and upon release, the crack will flex painfully.  Gum probing will detect attachment damage but usually after a few weeks after the crack forms. So sometimes the probe will not detect anything yet. To cold test if the tooth needs a root canal, a cotton pellet will be saturated with liquid nitrogen and placed on the tooth. If the tooth feels no cold, then the nerve inside the root canal died. Many dentists use Q-tip which does not get cold enough and will yield false results. If the cotton feels extremely painful and lingering over 30 seconds, the nerve is irreversibly damaged and needs a root canal. If the tooth feels cold and minimal pain, then it is normal. Du_deleted: I am so sorry @honestdoc for asking questions without images. I will try to get the images and post it here. He didn't talk about any bone disease or defects after seeing the images. He couldn't find anything and guessed about the fracture. \nThank you so much for other test information. I have never heard about it and done that before. I think an endodontist can test that for my issue. I will get the referral on Monday.  Just another question here. \nI bite down on tooth 30 and when I close the mouth, that side upper and lower tooth feels hard while biting. And when I bite down on 30, it hurts while biting and relieved while releasing the bite. Does it mean cracked it fracture root? Thanks. honestdoc: This is just a guess.  From my experience, the best case and most likely scenario is that you are clenching and grinding.  Fracture is when it hurts upon releasing the bite because the fracture flexes.  Try going to the store and pick up an Over the Counter Night Guard and try it.  Seeing a TMJ specialist will make custom bite appliances to manage and treat the condition.

If you are in US, do you have any recommendations for good dentist, endodontist, TMJ specialists in Atlanta. I really not trust the dentist opinion and I don't want to jump into extraction without concrete answer. My regular dentist also always give a guess answer. He did fillings on my left side  tooth which was very very small and I had a lots of trouble from that for an year. I don't know if I will get a genuine and concrete diagnosis from him on Monday if I go in. I am also planning to check with some endo to ask if I need RCT . I never been to any Endo in the US.

    "title": "Swelling under ears near the lower right jaw. Is it any tooth issue?",
    "dialogue": "Du_deleted: Hi all,\nI have jaw pain and swelling under the right ear near the lower end jaw. Exactly under the ear. It's very tender to touch. It's been there for more than 2 weeks. I had facial pain and pressure. I have nose and ear congestion. Went to the urgent care and they diagnosed sinus infection and Otitis media. Prescribed antibiotics and NSAIDs. Finished the medicine for a week. I still have the swelling and jaw pain. I also have sinus pain. I feel the pain in the face, upper jaw, ears when I bend down. I know sinus infection will take time to clear up. But this is the first time I have swelling under the ears near the jaw along with my sinus and ear pain. Whether it could be any tooth issue? I don't have any dental fillings that side. Upper wisdom tooth with cavity. No lower wisdom tooth. I chewed fish for a long time before this happened. i.e before 2 weeks. I chewed on the same side only. Whether that cause any swelling? I don't see any gum redness and tooth doesn't hurt when chew and swallow. I don't want to go to a dental visit at this current situation. I am not really sure if it's dental issue or swollen lymph nodes because of sinus infection. Any input is really appreciated. I still have the stretchy sore pain in the jaw under the ear and it hurts down the jaw line. I feel very sensitive in those teeth from this morning. It feels sensitive without chewing or anything inside the mouth. It's not sensitive to cold and hot foods. I feel very sore inside the ear and under the ear(jaw area). The swelling is still the same from day 1. I am keeping up with ice.  Anyone have any experience like this? Dr M: Do you perhaps have any radiographs of your teeth to better help us with an idea of what the cause can be? Du_deleted: Just an update here. I have the same ear pain, lower jaw pain, swelling under the ear and top of the neck area along with nose and ear congestion. Finished the amoxicillin antibiotics 2 weeks back. I have severe ear and jaw pain with swelling. So, I  went to an ENT today to check if it's ear or sinus issue. I thought of checking with ENT before going to a dentist. I told them the history. I am prone to cold , sinus infection and strep throat throughout the year. I get almost one infection in 2 or 3 months. So I told them about that too. I have not tested any allergies before.ENT checked my ears with an otoscope and did nasopharyngoscopy with Endo to check my sinus. He said my ears are completely fine and no sign of any infection. He said my sinus also looks clear and no pus.He said may be the swelling a secondary infection from sinusitis or TMJ. He was not sure. He told me to get an x-ray and CT scan after 2 weeks just to check if any infection present. He prescribed cefdinir for 2 weeks.The doctor was not sure why I have the jaw pain and the swelling. My sinus and ear is clear now as per the scope examination. He prescribed the antibiotics for 2 weeks and imaging after that.It could be TMJ or any tooth issue? I don't have any gum redness. \nI have called my dentist today to check this out. He is booked up today and till July 2nd. So they put me with another dentist tomorrow. I am planning to go in and check this out. I don't know if I am assumed this swelling as ear and sinus pain so far(more than 3 weeks).  I am going to the dentist tomorrow. This is going to be a new dentist and I am not sure how he is going to check. \nWhat should I ask for? Just posting here to get some information on hand. Do I need to ask for full mouth panaromic x-ray? Or normal x-ray? What else do we need to check since this involves my jaw area under he ear. Please help if you have any inputs. Thank you. Dr M: Good day,\nA full mouth panoramic radiograph would be best, since we can then assess your wisdom teeth and sometimes your TMJ as well. If it is a TMJ related issue, further investigations might be required.

I also told them I did chew some meat and fish hard before all this happened. I also hear a big snap or click from the jaw. Like a knuckle the next day. After that, swelling started with pain.followed by ear pain, jaw clicks while opening. They did check my bite with blue color stick(I think bite stick) and asked if I have any discomfort. I feel tender when I bite on tooth#30. He checked for few more times and that feels so tender. So he said I might have a fracture in that root. And he told me to get a CT scan for that tooth to check a clear picture. I asked if it could be a TMJ problem or jaw bone issue or jaw fracture problem. He said that doesn't look like jaw issue. And they said if it's jaw issue or TMJ, I won't get swelling under the ear and the jaw line.  I insist them to take panaromic x-ray just to check the jaw. Then he said ok. I had both pan and CT scan for that tooth. I am yet to receive the xray pictures from their office. I will share it here once I receive my email. \nAfter the CT scan, he said that it's predictable or not predictable. He couldn't see much of a crack or root fracture in the tooth. And guessing there might be a fracture and told me that either I have to extract the tooth or root canal with crown. \nBut he insist me that it's a trial and error. Even after root canal, it might give you the same pain. Then we have to extract it.  So, it's better to extract in the first place and do implant immediately. I was so shocked to hear these and completely blanked out. I don't have any idea how root canal or extraction will be. I would be happy if he said the answers conclusive. Not by a guess. Do the tooth crack or root fracture doesn't show up in x-ray or CT scan??? \nI asked if it works for wait and watch approach. He said I have to do it within a week. I have already delayed this because of assumption of ear,  sinus infection and he is surprised that it doesn't hurt me more all these days. He said it will hurt more if untreated. So, I have to decide if I have to do root canal or extraction on tooth 30. But I don't have any throbbing pain or gum redness or swelling inside on that tooth before I go in for a visit. I totally didn't think about that could be an issue. And about my upper wisdom tooth, in the xray the root color was black. So the dental assistant told me that root is getting there. Since I had already taken antibiotics in the past weeks, the dentist said he couldn't see any infection in any of the tooth in the x-ray. So, he also told me to take out the wisdom tooth #1. I am ok to take that. But I am thinking if I should take off #30. Whether the lower jaw pain, ear pain and swelling could be of wisdom tooth pain or infection. Since I taken antibiotics, that might be resolved. Is that possible??Will the upper wisdom tooth cause swelling on the lower jaw?? Any inputs?The dentist whom I saw today is new to the dental practice and he has been \npractising for an year. He asked one of his colleagues for an opinion and she also said the same after reviewing the CT scan. Whether fracture of tooth or root not shown in the images??Sorry for long post. Thanks for reading. I just want to be as detailed as  possible.

If it is a TMJ related issue, further investigations might be required.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...I have been dealing with upper and lower jaw pain with swelling under the ear. It's been more than 4 weeks. I did have some sinus infection and ear infection. I got some antibiotics from urgent care. After 2 weeks of antibiotics, the jaw pain, ear pain with swelling doesn't reduce. I went to an ENT this week to check my ear. He did Endo to check my sinus and also checked my ear. He said there is no infection in sinus and ear.I was so confused and did go to the dentist. He checked for infection in the x-ray and it's not. He said since I was on antibiotics, if at all there was an infection present in the upper wisdom tooth or any other, it would have been cleared. He checked all my tooth in that side with a blue color stick and asked me to bite. I felt some discomfort and tenderness on one tooth bite. It's tooth #30. He said I might have a fracture in that tooth root and asked me to get CT scan. I took CT scan for that tooth(#30) and pan xray.He didn't see any jaw bone issue in the pan xray. He said he couldn't find any crack in the CT scan. But he see something little and he is guessing that it might have a fracture. So he told me to go for extraction asap. He said RCT with crown might not work. If I feel pain after RCT, it's a waste of time and money. So he told me to go for extraction and implant immediately.I was totally confused and worried. He is not my regular dentist . My regular dentist is not available today and he is a new dentist and he has been practicing for an year.I don't know if I can proceed with extraction with this guess. I do have some pain in the upper wisdom tooth and i have to extract that. I feel sore and stabbing/throbbing pain in the upper wisdom tooth area and the lower jaw (exactly under ear and under tooth #30). It's swollen on the whole lower jaw. I don't know how to proceed with.\nI was assumed that this swelling and jaw pain was because of ear pain and that was cleared by ENT. Then I thought it's TMJ. But that is not as per the dentist. He said TMJ issue will not give this swelling. I feel continuous pain in the lower jaw area. If i bite down, I feel sharp pain on tooth 30 and relief while releasing.I don't know if its because of tooth# 30 crack or upper wisdom tooth or TMJ inflammation. How to identify?\nI do have throbbing pain in the upper jaw and the lower jaw throughout the day. I have some sharp pain in the upper wisdom tooth area and the lower tooth area(#30).\nI don't want to proceed with tooth #30 for rct or extraction without knowing the concrete answer for this issue. I don't want to exaggerate tmj pain if that's the cause. Dr M: Good dayI had a look at your x-rays. It is difficult to determine if a tooth has a crack from a normal panoramic radio-graph alone. I would have to have a look at the CBCT as well.\nOn your radio-graphs it does look like you have some infection on the top right wisdom tooth. And you mentioned that it is painful?\nIn my opinion I would approach this through a process of elimination. The top wisdom tooth needs to be extracted anyways, due to infection and due to no opposing lower wisdom, which means that over time this tooth will continue to grow in a downwards fashion, leading to problems later on. It is also completely possible that a top wisdom tooth, could cause pain on the lower jaw, especially if it is on the same side-this is called referred pain. So I would start there.\nIf the pain does not go away, I would consider getting a second opinion from a dentist that you trust-maybe have him look at your CBCT-this is your records after all.\nIf a crack is suspected, I would start with the first step of a root canal, rather than extracting the tooth.\nBy opening up the tooth, and removing the nerve tissue, you can sometimes better evaluate the crack, if there is any. If the pain and swelling disappears and no crack can be seen, the tooth can still be saved with a root canal obturation ( which is the second step of a root canal treatment ).\nIf there is a crack and the crack does not extend to the pulpal floor, or roots, root canal therapy can still be done with a crown to protect the top part of the tooth.\nIf however there is a crack that extends down, this might lead you to extract the tooth.\nEither way, the first step of a root canal treatment or emergency root canal treatment, can be used as a diagnostic tool in this case, and at least you don't pay for the full root canal treatment if it goes either way. ( Usually the second phase is more expensive ).It might also be worth your while to consider getting a referral or opinion from an endodontic specialist. This is a type of dentist that specializes in root canal therapy as well as the management of cracks. He could give you better advice on whether a tooth is worth saving or not, since he makes use of microscopes etc.Hope this helps."

I was with a dentist nearly 3 weeks ago n he filed a top broken back tooth but it still felt a bit rough n he said if it was not gone in 2 weeks i was to go back n see an oral surgeon, I went back to another dentist yesterday n he had a look, he said it doesnt look suspicious and said it is right on the biteline ... At the corner of my upper n lower back teeth is where the white dot sits and there is a tiny line on both sides of it which sit at the back and side of the lower molar. I have been on antibiotics the passed 10 days but doubt that would have made it come back, I have been rubbing vitamin e oil into it hoping that would help. I also keep touching it with my tongue but dont believe that would irritate it?? Im putting orabase on it too. The dentist said to give it a month, he filed the upper back tooth down more. He said if it doesnt go he would get the oral surgeon to have a look so that has me a bag of nerves now  this is the pic of it now .... honestdoc: Do you smoke?  Do you consume more than 1 alcohol servings per week?  If so, I would get it removed.  The image is more clear and I believe it to be a callous (hyperkeratinized tissue) with the etiology as stated above.  The body is making abnormal tissue from constant irritation/trauma.

I’m worried I may have a dry socket though currently there’s no bad taste and bad smell in my mouth. I’m currently experiencing slight throbbing pains in the area of extraction. I tried poking it but it seems like a tissue or I don’t know it may be a stucked food debris. See photos attached. honestdoc: It looks like normal epithelial repair tissue and healing good.  Hopefully you are not experiencing outside swelling.  Removing lower wisdom teeth can be very traumatic because the dentist/surgeon had to work inside the thick, dense jaw bone.

    "title": "Health anxiety and possible periodontitis. Scared.",
    "dialogue": "alwaysworried101: Hello, all. I am a 29-year old male who has had some form of gingivitis for the past 6 years or so. I remember my dentist pointing it out back then, but didn't pay much attention because it said I should just brush my teeth properly and see her regularly. Basically, my gum line, where the gums and teeth meet, are kinda reddish.I have diagnosed health anxiety, but haven't been really worried about dental problems even with this until now. I think being stuck at home, pandemic and all, has made me more focused on my body.Ever since I was a kid, I have always been told by dentists that I have the perfect set of teeth. I never had the need to wear braces. I never had a toothache in my life. Over the past 6 years, I've seen maybe around 3 different dentists all of whom said that I really have nice teeth but \"yeah, you're gums in the front are a bit irritated, but they're mild. So I'll just clean this and then you do this and that so they'll improve.\"I'm so frustrated because nothing hasn't changed much. I just want to reverse the inflammation and turn my gums into perfect pink. In a way, the problem hasn't gotten any worse. It's just that, the inflammation hasn't gone away completely.Okay, I understand I do have some problems with my dental habits:For the longest time, I've always brushed my teeth less than 30 seconds with the vertical technique only. Please don't judge me. I do this because I have this wrong mentality of \"the lesser I brush, the lesser I harm my teeth with all the movement so they won't bleed.\"\nI rarely floss. I only floss whenever there's food stuck in my mouth.\nI rarely do mouthwash. And if I do, I only gargle it in my mouth for like 10-15 seconds.\nI've had some blood tests and all for other unrelated dental issues and they all come back fine. I don't have any bleeding problems that I know of.Anyway, it's been a week since I've consciously altered my dental habits. I've been brushing for two minutes, been using mouthwash for 30 seconds, and been flossing regularly. I haven't been bleeding since I started doing these except for tonight, I saw some blood when I spat. I know I need to see my dentist to do more deeper and more professional cleaning, but with the pandemic, they only accept dental emergencies for the time being so I guess I have to wait. It's been more than a year since I last saw a dentist.I do think with the long time that this has been going, I do think it's some sort of periodontitis already.  Is there hope for me to somehow make my mouth healthier?  I feel it's the end of the world. Dr M: Good day Alwaysworried101.Firstly..don't despair!\nIn the beginning when trying to alter your brushing and flossing habits, it can be completely normal for it to bleed. Remember, your gums are inflamed and with inflammation, comes bleeding. The most important thing to do is to continue, since the inflammation will disappear and the bleeding will become less and less.\nIf you're worried about damaging your gums when brushing too hard, I recommend an Ultra Soft tooth brush for all my patients. A lot of them tell me that they feel it doesn't clean their teeth as well as they feel it should, but that is not the truth. With the correct frequency and technique, it does the job just fine. If you brush too hard, with a toothbrush that has hard bristles, it can actually damage your gums and teeth even more and lead to bleeding.\nGive it some more time to see if the altered habits make a difference.\nWith regards to periodontal disease, it will be difficult to give you an opinion about that, since a periodontal examination and xray might be needed.\nIn the mean time, just continue your good oral hygiene habits. The fact that you made this decision is already a step in the right direction. \nThe next step will be to see a dentist again for a thorough cleaning and examination, since sometimes, if we don't floss and brush as we should, especially in the lower anterior region, plaque can become mineralized and then unfortunately it becomes very difficult to remove with a normal toothbrush, causing constant irritation and bleeding.\nIf you have underlying health conditions such as hypertension or diabetes or even certain hormone fluctuations, this could lead to hyperinflammation and this could then be investigated if all else fails.\nStay positive!"

I have read on certain websites that it’s normal and others that it’s an infection. I can’t see my dentist until Friday so I would really appreciate anyone’s help! I have been ensuring to do all that the dentist instructed btw. Dr M: During normal healing of an extraction socket, the tissue sometimes appears yellow and then later turns pink as the normal process of healing progresses. It is also normal for some food to get stuck to the sutures, and this can also appear yellow. Some pain and swelling is normal 4 days after a surgical extraction and if the pain is improving, it is a good sign. My advice is to give it at least a week, and continue to keep the wound as clean as possible. Rinse with salt water or mouthrinse ( if prescribed ) and if there is no improvement at all, go and see your dentist, to make sure there is no infection."

I just found out that dental abscess can cause some serious problems like brain abscess if not treated. So its starting to get to me. I had my teeth checked last week. And just when I thought they could be yanked out as soon as anesthesia kicked in, the dentist had to stop the procedure because I could still feel the pain when she was trying to move my molar which shouldn’t hurt considering that shed already injected anesthesia thrice to numb them. I had also finished taking amoxicillin for 8 days but i feel like they gonna hurt again anytime soon. Ive never had extraction before cus im such a puss so Its gonna be my first time.Could you evaluate what happened? Should I take amoxicillin for another 7 days? She suspected that it still has pus inside my gum thats why its still hurting so she prescribed another amoxicillin but I no longer want to take any antibiotics as i might get resistant. Im planning to have an appointment again after my period. I appreciate your help. honestdoc: I would stop taking antibiotics.  You are correct about risk of resistance and a possible risk for C. Difficile infection.  Ask for laughing (nitrous) gas to help you relax and to numb more effectively.  Infected teeth usually comes out easier because the infection softens the bone. storm: Hi, thanks for your response doc. I really appreciate it. But is it okay to remove it even if it's gonna be painful because it still has pus on the gum? honestdoc: It needs to be removed.  Again, ask for gas.

Yes unfortunately I am.Probably one of the most awkward photos I've ever posted Thank you Dr M: When looking at the photo it is difficult to discern if it is only staining or perhaps a cavity. For this a radiograph might be needed to make sure there is no decay. It might be that you already had a area that was demineralized due to underlying decay and in such a case a filling might be needed.\nIt is also important to note that unfortunately smoking always causes staining that returns even after a cleaning and can even stain the filling, as well as the filling margins, over time .\nIt is best that you go and see a dentist and let them take an x-ray to evaluate the area fully. deanfourie: Thanks for the reply. Is there at least a way I can clean it. I have a date or two Dr M: It depends on how deep the stain/cavity goes. If it is a cavity, then no, you can't clean it. If the stain is superficial you can maybe try and remove it with a toothbrush and toothpaste."

MattKW: A 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash, e.g. Peridex, Savacol. honestdoc: MattKW said:\t\t\tA 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash, e.g. Peridex, Savacol.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nIn the US, Peridex 0.12% is only by presciption.  Non-alcohol base is usually on back order.  Long-term use can discolor/darken teeth.

IMO, if you have fairly healthy gums, no need for oral rinses.  I prescribe 0.12% Peridex for only 2 to 4 weeks in conjunction to deep cleanings for those with 5-6 mm gum pocketing and or poor home care/plaque control.  I try to get people not to rely on them.For people with bad breath, we try to identify causes such as poor hygiene, poor diet, possible diabetes, acid reflux and or other gastro-intestinal conditions.  A mother complained that her foster daughter had bad breath.  Upon examination, I concluded she may be anorexic due to Keto breath since she was confirmed not to be diabetic. Dr M: I agree with Honestdoc. A Chlorhexidine mouthrinse can  stain teeth if used too often for long periods of time. Best to use it when a dentist recommends it. Mouthwash is only an adjunct to normal oral hygiene habits such as toothbrushing and flossing"

Sometimes the gum  can be inflamed due to accidental injury to the area while eating, or even because of something that got stuck underneath the gum. Try flossing and see if something comes out and then just rinse the area first. If it becomes more swollen and red, then it might be necessary to go and see a dentist, to see if it is not maybe tooth related, and if additional medication is necessary. honestdoc: Have you had cold sores before?

Do I need to remove both teeth or just one? Do I need to do on the top left as well? Dr M: The bottom left tooth might need to be removed since the decay underneath the crown has gone into the root. Since it  is part of a bridge. The bridge will have to be sectioned and then only that tooth needs to be removed. Obviously you will be left with a large gap, but I would consider seeing a dentist for a full workup before replacing the gap with something fixed, since there are a lot of other problems that needs attention too Nata: Thank you for your reply.

I had a swelling and pain on the left side couple of weeks ago, and then I took some antibiotics for five days and swelling and pain gone.

This can be verified with a good peri-apical radiograph as well as a clinical examination from a dentist.\nIt could be that there is decay, or that a filling on the tooth has secondary decay, that is not visible in the photo, and it is an indication that the nerve has died.\nIt is important to note that antibiotics prescribed by a medical doctor or dentist, doesn't always take the infection away completely, and that antibiotics is never a solution to the problem.\nIf the swelling becomes bigger or the tooth becomes painful, it is better to rather go and see a dentist, so that a thorough examination can be done, to prevent complications that could lead to eventual tooth loss.

I haven't been to the dentist for 2 years was meant to go last year but practice cancelled the appointment and never got a new one through, however I do have relatively good dental hygiene, only 1 filling in 32 years and when I did go to dentist they always commented on how good my teeth were. I have looked at the teeth in the mirror and they look fine nothing obvious like a crack etc. When tapping or touching the teeth again nothing of concern, and when I clench my teeth I also get no pain. The pain doesn't change when I have hot or cold drinks. When looking at the gum area I don't seen anything particularly inflamed or red. When I touch the gum area I get no pain.

You will get buildup of plaque and sugar which in turn will rot your tooth and give infections inside your gum fast. Steve123: Sorry.

    "dialogue": "Sjk23: I noticed that I may have a broken blood vessel in the back corner of my mouth.  It is a small purple spot and when I put pressure on it or pull my cheek back, it disappears.  Is this a common issue inside the mouth?  I have had it for a long time.  My dentist has never said anything about it so I have always assumed that it is not a health issue.  It is in an area where there could be trauma when eating/talking.  You will also notice in one of my pictures that my gums on the top are very wide compared to my gums on the left side of my mouth and the gums extend all the way back to the corner of my mouth.  So I think it could be related to the inside of the cheek (where the possible broken blood vessel is) is continually rubbing against my top gums when resting/eating/talking.  So therefore, it caused a broken blood vessel. Above the purple spot in the picture, which is difficult to see, is very vascular.  It is dark purple and a lot of blood vessels.  Do you see that in some of your patients?I am going to bring it up at my next dental visit in July but thought I would see if I could get some clarification beforehand.I consider myself healthy and do not have any bleeding issues that I am aware of. Also, I do not have any symptoms related to that area of the mouth.Thanks for your time, honestdoc: I'm not understanding your concern for \"wide\" gums.  I'm not noticing any problems.  Vasculature appearance can vary and change.  Keep track of the appearance and provide us further images if it looks more scary. MattKW: There's nothing abnormal there. If you really want to see \"worrying\" vasculature, look at the underside of your tongue. All normal."

I don't know what the regulations are in your area, but we are still able to treat pain or cases where lack of treatment could worsen a situation. the biggest concern for health authorities about dental clinics is minimising the use of drills and the aerosols they generate. In an emergency, this can often be controlled by a rubber dam. For the replacement of the temp crowns, there is little or no use of drill in the mouth. Ring around. If they recement new temp crowns, ask for a hard, long-lasting cement like zinc phosphate, but hardly anyone keeps it anymore."

I remember she had some issues with her teeth. I will post a picture of my sister at age 7/8 and a picture of Jane Doe's teeth. My question is: could my sister be showing her primary laterals but permanents be congenially missing, then as her permanent cuspids descend, loose her retained primary laterals and only then in her later teens develop a gap between her permanent incisors? Is this possible? I have other photos of sister as well as info on Jane Doe's dentals if anyone is interested in looking this over with me. Thank you. Onefluover: \"* Dentals: Available. Prim cuspid between 5, 6. Teeth 7, 10, 14 congenitally missing.\n* DNA: Complete - Profile available at state lab.\"......Sister at age 13 years 10 months. Laterals appear to be missing. It was at not long after this age that I last physically saw my sister (though she was alive for about four more years) so I cannot verify such extreme gaps between her teeth. But I do remember vividly in the swimming pool her spraying me with water through her teeth... Zuri Barniv: There really is not enough info to go by because there are some gaps in your written history and in describing what each picture represents, But, yes, it is possible the permanent lateral incisors would be missing and permanent canines could take their place, but usually the canines look sharp and longer than either the lateral or central incisors. In other words, it would look quite different than the orange zoomed in picture and more like the cell phone image. But its unlikely it could look like orange pic and then a few years later like the cell phone pic with all the gaps. Not sure if that helps, but that's all I can say based on your info.\nDr. Barniv Onefluover: Thank you, Zuri.\nThe gapped-tooth picture is a mockup of a photo of Jane Doe's maxilla and mandible. Additional info on her:\"The Doe Network:\nHot Case 1278 http://www.doenetwork.org/hot/hotcase1278.html\nNamUs UP Case 2517 https://identifyus.org/cases/2517No Image AvailableUnidentified White Female* The victim was discovered on November 17, 1980 near Ludlow, San Bernardino County, California\n* Estimated date of Death: 1-6 months prior\n* Partial SkeletonVital Statistics* Estimated age: 17 - 22 years old\n* Approximate Height and Weight: 5' 5\"; 115 lbs.\n* Distinguishing Characteristics: Light red/brown/blonde hair.

She may possibly have been a nurse.\"....The only picture I have of my sister with semi clear smiling teeth showing was taken about 1969 when she was about 7. About ten or eleven years before she vanished and Jane Doe was discovered. I will now post the full family portrait only because my mother, brother and sister are all deceased and I, pictured at bottom at age 5/6 am authorizing it. What I'm trying to determine for starters is does the picture of my sisters teeth, in the opinion of an expert such as yourself, exclude a potential match or does the possibility remain that Jane Doe's teeth could be what my sisters teeth grew into ten years later? Zuri Barniv: In response to your private message, I was not able to open the attachment, but suffice it to say that between age 7 in 1969 and around age 17 when she vanished, the teeth change A LOT. Spaces could form or close, some teeth could stick out more and some less. Nothing much stays the same during those 10-11 years. The only indication you have that she was missing permanent incisors was the orange picture where they look short. But that can be explained easily without missing any permanent teeth.

My gums hurt when I floss not all the areas but yah they never used to hurt. I went to an emergency dental clinic today the guy said my gums don't look bad whatever that means and he prescribed me peridex which I am now using as of tonight along with flossing with thread brushing tongue scraping and using mouthwash. Idk there's just this bad taste in my mouth and also my right tonsil has been sore for quite some time I hoenstly believe it could be from them so I'm planning on getting them removed once I get the green light from the ent I will see in March. I also get a bad taste sometimes when I swallow which is why I think it could be from that. It's just that like.for a while I would suck on my teeth and like it didn't taste good. I wonder if it's dry mouth? The only things I could think of it being is dry mouth, gum disease, acid reflux, tonsil stones, sinus infection/post nasal drip??

Also I sneeze like three times a day (never had this) and idk why is that a sinus infection? honestdoc: How you know you have gum disease is the pocket probings are 4 mm and higher.  4 mm usually means inflammation, 5 mm and higher means inflammation with attachment loss.  Try to do as thorough home care as possible including cleaning the tongue.  You may need to visit the medical doctors for discussions on medications, possible gastro conditions like you mentioned, and possible diabetes.  The most common cause from my observations are people not eating properly and developing \"Keto\" breath.  That happens when the body breaks down fats instead of sugar.  There are numerous diet trends that restrict carbs leading to that breath.  I don't like Peridex rinse especially long term if you have normal pocket depths.  It may lead to discolored or darkening of teeth and the laziness of thorough hygiene."

I went to the receptionist to pay cash for the prophylaxis.Then a hygienist looked at my Xrays and began cleaning.  I asked about having the pocket sizes measured.  The hygienist nodded but continued to clean. Just before polishing, the pocket size measurements were measured: mostly 3mm (which is within the healthy range) but also about ten 4s (warning signs).  No gum bleeding.  In the past I've only had a few 4s that improved to 3mm by the next appointment because the hygienist spent more time cleaning on those areas.Should the pockets have been measured before the cleaning?  The hygienist could've then cleaned more carefully where the 4s are located.  Maybe that's where there might be some calculus below the gum causing the 4mm pocket irritation. honestdoc: Usually probing is done before cleaning unless there are tons of tarter preventing accurate pocket measurements.

The day after I had it done I had intense pressure constantly and felt like I needed to play with it with my tongue..I went back to the dentist the following week and told him it was still irritating me..he looked at it and said it looked fine..I changed dentist and got another opinion and she also said it looked fine..she took an exam of the tooth and said all looked ok and no swelling or nerve irritation however it still annoys me..like I said it doesn't hurt but when I brush it it feels like pressure after and i just feel like there is something wrong with it and I'm still finding that I'm constantly playing with it I have even cut all my tongue.

The sensitivity is there most of the time, but occasionally subsides.\nThe sensitivity only presents itself when eating/chewing on food on the left side.I'll spare you a detailed history of what transpired in this area of my mouth for now.I had a root canal done on (26) (Canadian numbering system) on June 11, 2015.When I consulted my regular dentist about the sensitivity on May 2, 2019 he did tests on the teeth in the upper left\nand said he was 99% certain the problem tooth was the root canal tooth (26).\nHe recommended I go see the endodontist who did the root canal.I saw the endodontist on May 9, 2019 and he did his own tests as well as take two X-rays (attached).\nHe concluded that (26) was fine and that the problem tooth was the one next to it (27).When I went back to my dentist, told him what happened and showed him the X-rays, he did more tests and now agreed that\nthe problem tooth was (27). He is recommending having a root canal done on the tooth.Before I do any work, I'd like to be certain the correct tooth is being worked on. Before the root canal was done on (26), my previous dentist\nmisdiagnosed a pain problem as coming from (27), (took out filling and re-did work on the tooth), when the problem tooth was actually (26).When I chew on the left side of my mouth, it feels like the sensitivity is coming from (26) or (25).Any advice? MattKW: From the Xrays alone, there has been a deep composite filling in the 27. So that makes it a prime suspect. If you're only having mild sensitivity, then a root canal is not required. Either the composite is leaking because the bonding is failing at the gumline (most likely), or the tooth has a crack. As a first step I would refill that tooth with an amalgam. Doing a composite at that depth is risky. DF-Mark: MattKW said:\t\t\tFrom the Xrays alone, there has been a deep composite filling in the 27. So that makes it a prime suspect.

I think he said the tooth was cracked and a filling wouldn't be possible. MattKW: Pain is elusive and misleading. What you personally feel is only one factor to consider.\nI would go somewhere else. If your current dentist did this filling, then I doubt he likes/wants to do amalgams. Find someone who does amalgams. I teach 1x day a week at my local uni, and all the students want to do is composite. This really limits their skill set, and means they can't do an amalgam when the situation absolutely calls for it as the superior material.\n To jump into an RCT when all you have is sensitivity is totally unjustified. Once you do an RCT on that sort of tooth, you have taken further risks (what if the RCT fails?), AND you will have to do a crown. DF-Mark: MattKW said:\t\t\tPain is elusive and misleading.

I complained about a pain somewhere in the upper left.\nShe determined the problem tooth was way at the back (27).\nShe took out existing filling, and re-did a new filling (first temporary, then permanent).\nBut the pain didn't go away, so she had worked on the wrong tooth!When she determined the problem tooth was 26 she recommended an endodontist to do a root canal.\nI went to this endodontist and he did a root canal on 26.So the last work that was done on 27 was not done by my dentist. He just feels that the tooth at this stage \"can't be saved\".I will try to see another dentist to see if they will put an amalgam in 27.I would also add that I was told the fillings in 27 are so close to the nerve that redoing the filling would be very risky.\nCould this be true?\nFor example, if problems arose when doing the amalgam, could that rule out a possible root canal? MattKW: You are having sensitivity now. That is irritation to the nerve, and the longer you leave it, the less chance of recovery with just a filling. Sure, taking out the filling and redoing will entail some risk of it stirring up the tooth a bit more and may well tip it into doing a root canal. But you're heading towards that certainty UNLESS you do something. You would still be able to do an RC if necessary, but here's the biggest problems: That 27 is already structurally very weak...\nIf it turns into an RCT, then it will be further weakened...\nIf you do an RCT for the 27, then you would need to do a crown to prevent fracture...\nA crown that deep is risky.So, if the FILLING can be done done for the 27 WITHOUT ending up in an RCT, then accept that it will break one day and will have to be extracted. Don't do a crown on the 27, but do a crown on the 26.\nIf the 27 gives you trouble and an RCT is suggested, then I would instead have it extracted, and spend my money on doing a crown for the 26. You can survive happily with one molar, but don't lose both. The 2nd molar is the least desirable tooth to spend money on and keep. Steve123: Just remember time is of the essence Mark. If it is a cracked tooth. You dont want to waste time. An infection inside your gums can happen in no time based on your diet and brushing. So fix it asap."

I'm 73 and all of a sudden, my teeth are giving me problems. I had an abscessed gum in May where the teeth need removed but I was a coward (horrible dentists in the past) and didn't get them pulled. Now, the infection is back and I need to see my dentist next week for another round of penicillin and talk to him about my options. He told me in May I could get a partial but I'm wondering if I might be due to have more teeth pulled in the near future. I have broken and fractured teeth (all uppers) and my one front tooth is nothing but filling. It's been ground down so much that there isn't any tooth left for a crown.I'd appreciate your opinion. Thanks. MattKW: Hard to say. Your dentist is in the best position to assess the history of your teeth, and the prognoses for the remaining teeth. Acrylic (plastic) partial dentures can usually be altered if further teeth are lost later; nylon (\"Valplast\") and metal (CrCo) partial dentures can't be altered if any further teeth are lost.

    "dialogue": "Jimd3246: To begin, I am 74 years old and just broke a front (#9).  I'm advised the tooth can't be saved.  Considering my age does it make sense to do implant, or a bridge? MattKW: Usually I would suggest an implant unless the teeth adjacent to the gap have been heavily filled. \nIt isn't wise to do crowns on healthy, untouched teeth if avoidable. Also, older teeth generally have a longer crown so the tipping forces and root support can be unfavourable for a bridge. And older teeth are more glass-like, and therefore liable to fracture. Jimd3246: Thanks. For the response. I'm still thinking it over. Lot of expense difference. I'm just trying to justify it. MattKW: Well, you can always stick in a small partial (acrylic or Valplast) denture for the moment. Another possibility is a Marylands bridge, cantilevered off the adjacent central incisor if you meet the criteria."

    "title": "Root canal or pull it",
    "dialogue": "Steve123: I have a serious cracked tooth pain. The cracked pain is from a large filling made on a molar. I believe microcracks were made inside the filling from how violent the dentist was when using the burr tool. It has now lead to many visits with diff dentists and most are clueless. I am very sure it is microcracks causing it. It will not allow anything from a blackberry seed to pizza crust to be chewed on it. The tooth before this operation was perfect. Im thinking tooth has too many microcracks inside of filling. Now i may be pressed to choose between root canal/crown or extraction. All because of someone elses carelessness. Photo does not show much. You can see more of the shape in dark room with white led light up close. It has most of its cusps cut off. The shape is 90% flat. The filling to tooth ratio is 90% filling. No real tooth left. The dentist put this huge unnecessary filling to be proactive with decay. I want to know is removing this tooth smarter than a root canal. I hear more bad things with root canals like Heart attacks and bacteria inside. Rather not have that potential with removal of tooth.Tooth is bottom back molar. I believe it is my 2nd molar since i took out my wisdom teeth Sonia Salamuri: Hello, if the dentist put a very big filling inside a cavitie, maybe you have an irritaded pulp right now. It could be pulpitis. Sensitivity in a tooth could be caused by the proximity of the restoration material to the pulp tissue, and the bite pressure could also affect the pulp, causing inflammation. If you need a root canal, you should see an endodontist. But first, try the dentist, to check the vitality of the tooth pulp, and a rx, to check the periapical area. Steve123: Hi SoniaNo this is not a case of irritated pulp. Filling not close to pulp and it has been over 6 months straight with same pain. Feels like the tooth got shattered and was taped back together. Funny thjng i had same type pain on another tooth that dentists were lost about and that made me not eat on a side for 2 straight years. What fixed that was a simple burr tool shaving it down. Just came back from a dentist and he said looks good. So this is what i hear when i do not flinch when they give me there bite test. Anf they do not want to touch a healthy tooth. It may look healthy in xray. But it is far from it. It doesnt work all day everyday. So i need to find a doctor who has a listening ear. Will be going to another dentist in 2 days. honestdoc: I understand you have pain for over 6 months.  Does the tooth hurt spontaneously?  Is it sensitive to colds or heat?  What was the condition of the tooth before the filling was placed?  It is hard to diagnose and locate fractures.  Many times the micro-fractures or craze lines pose no problems...I have them on all of my teeth.  For me, I would take a bite wing and periapical x-ray to study the bone and root tip patterns.  I would perio probe around your teeth for any attachment loss.  I would utilize the tooth sleuth biting stick on each cusp.  Next I would apply cold test.  Do you grind and or clench and not know it?  There could be many different possibilities for your pain.  2nd lower molars are more vulnerable due to their smaller size and the enormous stress they take. Steve123: I appreciate the help. I do not have spontaneous pain. It is def not pain in gum or pulp. It is almost most def cracks on inside of tooth. The Doc who used the drill excavated a bit too much leaving a fishbowl frame. Was very violent with that tool. Took 20 mins of drilling. The bigger the cavity the more risk of pain that can happen. I know it is tooth telatedfir many reasons. Hot cold barely any. No throbbing ever in gums before and after the faulty filling. Mouth before op was in tip top shape. No pains or aches at all. All teeth had no decay. This was an attemot to be proactive and stop decay. Because of a slight grey area. The tooth sleuth doesnt trigger the pain due to the stick only landing on the real tooth which is the 4 cusps remaining. If there was a pea size ball i could place on the flat filling surface then try. It would send me through the roof. That sleuth misses the area that has the pain. I fixed a similar pain on another tooth after 2 years of not eating on 1 side by a simple trim job with burr tool.\nI should have got a second opinion for this filliing. The grey spot was staining. So i switched a working tooth for a massive pain and no function at all. Steve123: This is what im talking about. The red lines are the microcracks which are close to dentin and nerves. Even tons of cracks on the paper thin walls made. Cant hold much toughness and cracks on those walls would feel twice or 100x more amplified due to how fragile it is due to thickness. \nI can go on and on about this tooth. And all the theories. Steve123: So i am an investigative person. When i was given the sleuth stick test and no pain was triggered. I knew that wasnt the best test for this problem. I needed a smaller tool. Skinnier also. So i used a match stick. And i can pin point the exact location. Reason why the matchstick. An trigger it has to do with a couple things. Here is a shot of where i lay the matchstick and bite with a fully closed mouth. Instead of that sleuth which has half the force being used because half your mouth is still open. Impossible to get an accurate account with that tool because my pain never happens with my mouth open.\nSo with this find i think i may have saved my tooth from a root canal or extraction. The matchstick is the one that has dimension so it mimics a food like a blackberry seed which gives me extreme pain. When the matchstick is being bitten on those 2 back cusps it feels like none of my teeth are touching on either side. Which means pressure pain is the cause.Thank u ahead of time honestdoc: I'm trying to make sense of your situation.  Where did you have your dental work done?  You can always go for 2nd or more opinions. Sonia Salamuri: I agree with Honestdoc. I was thinking about what you said about the gray staining, and the drilling. I believe that, you probably had a X-ray before the treatment, to check if there was a big decay on the tooth, even if it wasn't to big from the outside view. You can, using those x-ray, have an ideia about the necessity of the treatment that was done, or get a second opinian about it. At least, is what I can think that could help. I hope you can solve that situation soon. MattKW: It would help if we could see a  pre-op digital xray. Impossible to say anything much else today. Steve123: Not sure why you need it as im dealing with a cracked tooth pain. And it does not show cracks on the xray. Even with the xray. Your still half clueless as to how the filling sits in the tooth due to the xray only being 2d MattKW: Because you are the one saying it is cracked tooth pain, not the dentists, and all you have to show is a unhelpful photo. Correct, cracks don't show up on Xrays, but it will show me the depth of the cavity that you think the dentist has overdrilled, and possibly an idea of what materials he used to fill it."

I shall let you know if I get any information which may help you too.I think if it is minimal, they may use bonding or tooth coloured cement maybe. Definitely quite commonly fixed without crowns I am told!! DocT: Hey guys,\nDentin showing on the chewing surface and at the gum line - not the same thing. On the chewing surface dentin becomes visible when enamel is gone, is usually related to 1 -mechanical trauma - excessive biting forces to this particular tooth (tooth seats higher than the rest of your dentition or some kind of parafunction (grinding, clenching, biting on an objects...), or 2 - chemical trauma - acidic environment in your mouth ( acidic beverages and foods, tobacco/alcohol, acid reflux/bulimia). Your tooth surfaces wearing down from these and exposing dentin definitely need to be fixed, but exposed dentin at the gumline and on the chewing surfaces are absolutely not the same thing. If more than a third of the chewing surface is exposed dentin, the general protocols call for a crown. Exposed dentin only on the chewing surfaces most likely means that you are bruxing (grinding) your teeth against one another. Exposed dentin at the gumline from a chip can occur for many more reasons, but if it is relatively small, it can likely be fixed with a simple filling. Smithsonian1: Very informative thanks. Most of my upper teeth at the gumline are showing dentin progressing down, and it has happened over the last year or two. Would bonding be an option if it is just cosmetic?P.S Never had a filling no issue on the chewing surface, and teeth have been looked after always!! Thanks again!! DocT: It sounds like predominantly gum problem. I would check two things : 1- the way you bite down / bring your teeth together. If during chewing or even just swallowing your saliva you put too much pressure on the side of your teeth, you might start losing gum and underlying bone as the result of chronic trauma. 2 - see a gum specialist to check your individual anatomy, it might be the way your jaw was built from the beginning. With first scenario you need some bite correction followed by night guard to prevent further damage and possible gum graft to restore proper teeth support and gum protection if needed. If trauma is not the case, gum graft alone or nothing would be the answer. Of course it could be other explanation as well, but this is what I can tell, based on your problem description. Smithsonian1: Cheers doc appreciate that. There doesn’t seem to be any gum receding just less enamel at the top of each tooth. I will look into it, thanks again!! DocT: Well, if your gum is not receding and defects look like wedges, you are talking about enamel dentin junction, where enamel - tissue covering tooth - border with cement - tissue covering root. This area works like stress relief and over prolonged withstanding to excessive stress can be damage. So, you need to check bite forces, brushing technique ( could be too aggressive), toothbrush you use (bristles condition) and do not worry. As long as they are shallow and you do not feel any discomfort, you are on the safe side. If they are getting deeper, do bonding or feelings; deep defects at the enamel dentin junction weaken your teeth and potentially can cause fracture. Smithsonian1: Cheers Doc thanks again, think I got the general jist of what you recommend.Have a good day.Kind regards,Stuart. DocT: Good luck!"

    "dialogue": "JM: Every month or 2 i get a really bad sore throat. They can last for weeks and usually come with a fever, sometimes it is so bad i have had to go to the hospital for several days. But the weird thing is every single time i go i get a different diagnosis. herpes, Kawasaki disease, hands foot and mouth disease, strep throat, ear infection, Early meningitis. Every time its different, i just want to get to the bottom of it, and if possible find out what is causing it, and if i can prevent it.For the last couple years, i noticed my tonsils look like how they do in the picture, whether i have a sore throat at the moment or not. They looks like they have little holes, almost like a honeycomb. I also get large sores like the one you can see in the picture as well, that hurt so bad, sometimes i can hardly drink water.Has anyone seen anything like this? Or have any suggestions for things i can try to get it to stop? Anon1234: The holes are a normal feature of the tonsils and I believe they are referred to as tonsil crypts. Many people struggle with tonsil stones and these stones can bring on a variety of symptoms, such as a sore throat. As for the sore, it looks like a common canker sore and these can occur from a poor diet, trauma or a weakened immune system. Rinsing with warm salt water will help relieve pain."

I believe it is due to bleaching them when younger, and also medication taken long term for Crohn’s disease. Of course I am no expert, hence being here.I just wanted to enquire, on whether this is a relatively common issue and how it can be minimised and fixed if possible?Kind regards,Stuart. MattKW: Not due to bleaching. If you have any loss of enamel, it has to be due to external acidic erosion. This may in the form of drinks and foods (most common, e.g. soft drinks, sports drinks, juices) or stomach acids from bulimia or reflux. Not from any medication, although I have seen it happen from chewable Vit C tabs (ascorbic acid). Smithsonian1: Hi Matt thanks for your response. Really? That does surprise me, I am very careful with what I eat and drink, being from a professional sports background. I was always told that whitening my teeth as I used to could cause this. My doctor also mentioned particular meds can affect teeth. What in your opinion is the likely suspect then?Also Is it relatively easy to cover, or would I need crowns or caps? MattKW: Whitening definitely won't cause it. You'd have to examine your diet carefully for any acids. Best if you go see a dentist and see what they think.

Long story short, or short story long. \nMy bite is off, i have recession, bone loss, verrry short roots on front teeth from ortho at 14,  missing tooth, super sensitive teeth and in need of a night guard asap. I take very good care of my teeth, rinsing after eating, tooth mouse, gum rinse, salt water rinse different tooth brushes for times of the day.. the list goes on. Do my xrays show that i am a candidate for an implant on this first molar? Should i go the route of a partial?\nThe dentist i see now wants to do all of these things and then the night guard last. \nMakes no sense to me as all l need is to get an impression of the upper teeth so i have at least a barrier between my teeth at night. Thisbites: Any insight or suggestions as to how to go about plan of care in order of importance..\nappreciated\n(im not bipassing my dentist by any means but there are many variables here..thanks ) DocT: Can you specify : 1- where do you have recession? ( I see bone loss in upper right and upper left molar areas only) 2- why do you think your bite if off? What exactly is off? 3- why do you need ortho? What does need to be corrected? What are you trying to achieve with orthodox treatment? \nAnd yes, implant is the best solution to restore missing tooth #19. I would definitely go for this Thisbites: goodevening and thank you for the prompt response.\nim also seeing that i duplicated some imagesSo when i say recession im referring the the receding gumlines on the molars especially the lower. Just exposed roots here and there, part of aging..\nI moved from out of state and have seen two dentist since being back. One was the one who wanted to do on the spot implant at every visit\nThe new dentist i have now is basically giving me a snap shot treatment plan of what things should be taking place. \nI believe he is suggesting ortho because i have no support in my bite (14 & 15) are not biting or connecting with the lowers, and the shifting continues due to the missing 19 x 6 yrs. \nHonestly i would like\nto focus on taking super care of my teeth while i have what i have, and then get my own night guard (send out lab) and then the implant as soon as i heal from the recent work i had done yesterday.\nI heal slowly so i am ofcourse nervous about going down that route but believe its a great option..maybe a perio vs oral surgeon to do it?\nThanks DocT: Well, it’s hard to recommend a treatment plan, based on the x-rays alone, without clinical evaluation. But based on the information given, there are some recommendations addressing your concerns. \n I would be super careful considering second orthodontic involvement since you have many roots affected / shortened throughout your entire dentition as the result of your previous ortho treatment, not only the front ones. Your dentist can use different approaches to restore vertical contacts except braces. \nYou need implant or bridge on the bottom left to restore not only extracted tooth #19, but tooth #20 which probably was removed for your first ortho. Edentulous space is pretty big  and will adversely affect any treatment. You need to have uninterrupted row of teeth not only to restore, but also preserve and keep proper achieved occlusal pattern.\nNG is just a piece of plastic protecting something while you are sleeping. Before you go for it, you need to know, what exactly you want to guard in your mouth at night. Your dentist might postpone fabrication of this orthotic device because he is planning specific kind or design that requires properly restored bottom teeth. Just ask him, I’m sure he can explain. Thisbites: Super reply\nCan you be my dentist?\nAlthough my current new dentist (recently moved from out of state) is definitely efficient, I wonder why he would suggest ortho\nwhen ive had it prior and there are short roots (yes not just the front ones but many) I would think that he would not suggest that>\nIm guessing to get the bite right and have as you say a proper occlusal pattern.\nWhat approach could he use as a dentist to help with my malocclusion?Yes 20 is  missing is due to ortho and its a big space for sure.  Does this mean that any work done wont matter? \nI guess i would like any plastic between my teeth at night because its better than grinding and contact.\nI want a barrier between my teeth, so as to preserve what i have. \nYou are right he does want to wait until everything gets completed before he takes an impression for the NG.\nI still see it as a timing issue and for me personally Prevention is almost more important than having everything perfect as that could take months and months to complete a successful implant.\nAnother question i had was pertaining to a flipper to have in the interim for 19.\nLike a valplast fitted thing i  could use. I can say honestly that not having a first  molar has been such a hard time. \nthanks for your insight..your good! DocT: Well, I definitely don’t want to interfere with your doctor’s plans. I’m sure he knows what he’s doing. Still regarding your questions.\nOrtho treatment - If we are talking about limited ortho (3-4 month duration of treatment) just to upright teeth #18/17, you can place implant or implants ( if edentulous space is too big for one tooth) and use them as a fulcrum / pivot point for ortho leverage instead of your natural teeth in front of the defect. Root length of you molars #17,18 appears to be normal, and can survive another ortho treatment; premolar #21 and especially canine #22 look a little shorter than normal and probably not the best candidates.\nFlipper for missing teeth - not a bad idea, especially as a temporary restoration. I’m not a big fan of dentures retaining by remaining teeth. There is nothing wrong about it, but your hygiene in this case must be flawless, immaculate. You always will accumulate excessive bacterial plaque b/w teeth surface and contacting denture parts. Just be sure you clean your teeth and denture at least 3 times a day or you become susceptible to demineralization of outward teeth layers followed by incipient caries and finally actual cavity that needs to be fixed. So, be careful.\nNG - could be neutral device just guarding your teeth from wear and fracture, retainer-like trays to prevent teeth drifting, shifting, angulating as well as teeth surface protection from light occlusal forces; deprogrammed preventing TMJ misalignment due to parafunction triggered by excessive muscle movement; repositioning orthotics to correct muscle contraction and prevent spasm or stabilizers. Do you know which one you need? What kind of problem are you trying to solve with NG? \nOcclusal alignment - without ortho, if you just need to bring you disoccluded teeth back into contact ( usually localized problem,Involves a few teeth) you can go with occlusal overlays ( composite chair side or lab fabricated ceramic restorations). They do not restore any teeth defects, but bonded on top of your teeth to fill the open space b/w top and bottom teeth. It’s not that simple and primitive as I described, but this is the idea. Thisbites: Thanks so much for the information\nI used to have a night guard in the past form grinding,and have woken up mornings with very sore teeth.\nI think it comes and goes (grinding) but I simply want to be preventive, and a NG seems to be practical.\nThe dentist im seeing is new (just moved here) so hes not really privy to all that is with my teeth and has a practice that he manages \nalon\nAfter these xrays were taken ive had a few more restorative things done. \nNov 3 crownprep and seat on #21 as part of filling came out.\nDec 2  #18 was redone..the crown as i had intermittent dullpain with it.Quite a bit for my taste, but prior dentist suggested it and i trust him so the new dentist confirmed it so i went with it. Now ive got dull pain in #30 after  29/30/31 were done.(december 27) composite filling on the buccal side of 30..kind of cracked and old.id like to take a break and let things settle. I really do not enjoy going to the dentist but feel like its necessary if two dentists say the same thing and its prevenive.\nA question for you\nHow long should i wait for this 30 to settle down? It just feels like pulp is inflamed mildy but not going anywhere as  far as settling down.\nThis is why i really have anxiety about my teeth and dental work because you dont know what will happen to you, and if you will lose your teeth...very stressful.\nAlso why is it that people who literally take $#%^ care of their teeth have no pain? no nerve pain..minimal.\nYet those folks like myself perhaps..who are over the top careful (to the point of declining food)so as not to chew or deal with pain have so much sensitivity and pain? DocT: Dull pain, mild discomfort, sensitivity to temperature after restorative work happen  quite often, relate predominantly to the properties of dental material and usually take 6-8 weeks to disappear. \nWe all have our week spots - teeth, skin, joints,metabolism.

I dont care what anyone says.\nAlso\nwhen going into dental work, one must really understand that its a roll of the dice as to whether or not your teeth are going to recover. The pulp is so sensitive and dental work is TRAumatic to teeth. I never underestimate this now, hence hesitation going in. DocT: Ok, you do not heat people complaining about their teeth and dental work since you are not a dentist or any dental office team member. I see this situation often enough. Check dentists around, get word of mouth referral. Today we have a lot of really great dental materials available to eliminate post-treatment complications. If your dentist is up to date with his materials, you should  not be uncomfortable after treatment. Dentist has a beautiful opportunities to combine material the way he wants to achieve certain goal; we have desensitizing bases, liners, surface sealants. You can discuss sensitivity issues with your dentist and he might try to solve the problem. It’s very doable.\nPlease do not hesitate to ask me a questions, if you have any - I would be happy to help, if I can.\nBy the way, your teeth are in a not bad condition at all. You are pretty far from dentures Thisbites: Thanks Doc TI will post the conebeam scan (that the other denstis is verrry reluctant to give me) and a few new xays when i get them done, perhaps it can give you more insight as to whether or not I could even handle an implant because of how crazy painful my gums get.\nI believe that dentists do their best. I also have had poor luck with a few dentist who did not really make sure that \nI was comfortable or ok..just sent me home. \nIt a hard profession im sure to deal with patients like myself. But like you said, a pt shouldnt have to be uncomfortable weeks after treatment. I believe he did what he thought was correct for the fillings. Im not sure what material he could have used but you mention desensitizing bases? If he is aware of how sensitive my teeth are wouldnt he have used this material? Maybe it was alot of work (29,30,31)and the tooth is not ready to settle down. Not dentist fault. \nim 1 week tomorrow..post tx,  inflamed sore gums, and dull mild ache on 31. oh well DocT: I would definitely share my experience with the doctor and, if appropriate, ask him about desensitizing therapy. I’m sure he has an options. Do you see inflamed swollen bleeding gum? Or you only feel the discomfort but can’t see anything unusual?\nCBCT images are very helpful. Let’s see what you have there Thisbites: My gums never bleed really, but with this dental work on the composite filling on buccal side 30 its quite inflamed and very sore.\nmy gums and teeth are just sensitive no matter what.\nwill post ugly picture\nmy pano came in just early what a coincidence finally after a good wait and resistance\nwill send over Thisbites: This might help ? Thisbites: If everything settles down, then id like to see about doing the 19 implant.. maybe 3 months from now..I just am not sure if im a candidate being a worry wart and having slow healing gums. DocT: On the buccal of tooth #30 you show gum recession. I'm not sure if you had this issue before restorative work was done or after. Most likely this is preexisted condition. You can try to rinse with salt water or backing soda warm solution.\nAs for conebeam, it is not the images that show you 3D for proper measurements and I did not get any additional information to be able to do so. Sorry Thisbites: Thank you for the response. Yes this was before restorative work. This tooth has intermittent dull achy thing going on x 5 yrs.\nWhat would it mean when you have a tooth (#30 crown) that spontaneously has naggy pain that comes and goes. Does this merit a root canal or should i simply deal with it? I dont believe that there is anything that is serious on the tooth other than the recession.\nThis nagging feeling isnt gummy its deep in the tooth.\nThe redo o the buccal composite didnt seem to help this although the \ngums have healed ok. You were right, healing takes time.  i turned the corner about 8 days post work."

I haven’t gotten the permanent crown yet.\nMy concern is that this is maybe something sinister as I used to drink alcohol quite regularly but gave that up 2 years ago. \nI noticed this a week ago and it looks like it’s grown a little, towards the back where it is curving off...however my tongue keeps running over it so maybe that’s not helping. The area is bordered by a distinct line around the back and feels smooth and maybe a little swollen. I thought maybe even an infection? My health anxiety is getting the best of me so any insight would be great.\nThank you! honestdoc: It is hard to diagnose off of the image.  I have a lot of questions.  Is that crown a temporary since you had mentioned of not getting a permanent crown.  X-ray images preferably peripical and bitewing views would be very helpful.  I need to know the status of the previous root canal treatment, any recurrent cavities under the crown, gum probing for loss of attachment, etc. Darbygirl: Thanks for your reply!The tooth does not have a permanent crown. It was just the temporary but it broke about a year ago. I haven’t had any problems with it but did notice some darkness so thought maybe that was decay but maybe that’s just what it looks like? I was going to get the crown soon...been saving for that. When I feel with my tongue from the back side it feels puffy.\nI also feel like it’s been irritated for a little while. I notice I tend to chew things on that side and I think I’m pretty full gusto when I do. I took a picture in mid October to see if anything was there but it was totally clear. So I don’t know how long it’s been this way. Here is another picture just for a different perspective on color. Everything I have read says Erythroplakia is fire red which I don’t know that this is but I guess that could be unreliable.\nI do plan to call my dentist on Monday but was trying to calm my fears a little.\nI appreciate your help! honestdoc: I see the red area but I don't know what is causing it.  Hopefully after x-ray images and full evaluation may lead to more accurate diagnosis. Darbygirl: I really hate to bother but I’m having so much anxiety right now. Looking at last Sundays picture and this mornings picture, it looks quite a bit worse. If this would be something bad would it change this much in a week?\nI appreciate your time in helping me. honestdoc: The borders look regular so I don't think anything sinister.  Try to get seen ASAP.  I think it can be treated. Darbygirl: Thank you again. I have an appointment tomorrow with my dentist. Hopefully I’ll get some answers."

    "title": "Choking On Water During Root Canal",
    "dialogue": "dental_issues_101: I went to a new dentist. They recommended fitting me for crowns due to my bruxism. I agreed and they started the procedure.I was choking during the procedure from the water flow that wasn't being siphoned. Is this normal? I had a root canal before and this never happened. i was choking for 30 minutes, and the dental assistant told me to \"try to breath out of my nose\". I'm assuming she didn't turn on the siphon, and let the water drain down my throat during the procedure. MattKW: Root canals have rubber dams, and this can also be used for fillings. Can also be used if necessary for some part of the crown preparation, but would need to be taken off in final stages. Doesn't sound like this place is going to be able to do multiple crowns for you. dental_issues_101: Sorry this was not a root canal. I have bruxism and they were preparing my lower left and lower right teeth to being fitted for a crown. They worked on both teeth.Does that change your answer at all? They did not use a rubber dam. The dental assistant had a water tube and water siphon, and the dentist had a mirror and a drill. That's all they used, and I was choking for 30 minutes on the water draining down my throat.Why isn't that place going to be able to do multiple crowns for me? I'm not making a connection between multiple crowns and the rubber dam. MattKW: I mean to say that root canals are always done with rubber dams, and fillings can be done with dams, but crowns aren't normally done with dams (I've certainly never tried it). And if you found a single crown preparation hard to manage at this clinic, how are you going to manage doing more? Maybe it's a DA who doesn't suction well, maybe you'll have to ask to be put more upright? dental_issues_101: Thank you for the response.Is it normal for a DA to not suction well after I told them I was choking multiple times? Has this happened in your own experience?I'm looking for a baseline, since you do this every day. Is this abnormal? MattKW: If the tooth is nearest the DA (usually left side), then that's harder for her to suction but easier for the dentist, and vice versa. Some procedures are harder to control the suction, some patients are more tolerant of water; it's a game of adaptation. Modern dentistry is larely performed with patients flat on their backs or even tilted slightly with their head down. Great for dentists, not so good for patients. But you can always ask to be seated more upright, or ask for more breaks in treatment - I find this is commonly required by patients with back or neck injuries.Sometimes my DA and I do dentistry standing up. dental_issues_101: Have you had patients complain about choking on water, who did not have back or neck injuries? If so what did you do in response? Did they continue to choke throughout the procedure, and you took breaks as needed? MattKW: Sit them more upright, give them more breaks."

    "title": "Teeth not improving.",
    "dialogue": "gary2019: Hi,On March 27, 2018 I first posted on here about my teeth having multiple issue due to having high volumes of sugary drinks all of the time, and many other \nreasons. (https://www.dentistry-forums.com/threads/will-my-teeth-last-forever-is-it-too-late.24951/)I got advised to buy tooth mousse, as a many of my teeth started to have white patches, where begins. After using tooth mousse since then, I have also been brushing twice a day with Colgate Duraphat 5000ppm Toothpaste given to me by my dentist. (attached below) I don't understand why I have seen no difference? I have had the odd sugary drink still here and there, do I need to fully stick with plain water?Am I using too sodium fluoride? Is that causing the damage? Should I be brushing my teeth with fluoride tooth paste, flossing and then applying my retainer containing the tooth mousse in that order like I have been? Or does that remove the toothpaste?? I am really confused, and beginning to worry. MattKW: The order is  of usage fine, but don't expect miracles. \nI see that you haven't done anything about the decay in the canines. I'd also suggest you replace the old composites for a better appearance. gary2019: But will all of the white area of my teeth eventually go back to how they were originally? Also, is that all the tooth mousse is for? The white patches? Or black parts as well? With the decay on the canines, what can I do? When I feel around that area it feels like there is no holes there, but just black spots... I am not sure if I can have a filling on them?With replacing the composites, I am guessing you are mainly referring to the two circles? I worry that the Red circle more specifically would just snap my tooth if they were to renew that as it is a root canal tooth, Doesn't that make it significantly weaker?Thank you. MattKW: The decay as arrowed.\nYou may not have to remove the entire composites, but cut back the top 2mm and fill over. If your dentist thinks that's OK. DocT: You can’t use toothpaste or dental gel to cure the cavities. 100% agree with Dr. MattKW - decay needs to be removed and cavities filled. Regarding white spots, if you do not see much or any improvement after using hygiene product for a while, you need to talk to your doctor. Those white spots can become a real cavities and will require treatment at some point and it would be better if you act now. There is ICON resin material that can be applied on affected areas utilizing resin infiltration technique. ICON will infiltrate the tooth surface to fill voided and defects and restore structural discrepancies  throughout entire enamel up to the first layer of dentin; doesn’t require any shots, drilling, no additional tooth damage, just one appointment. gary2019: Problem is with my dentist, I do get treatment for free, but only \"essential\" treatment. I mentioned the black areas to my dentist in your photo MattKW last year, I got told that it was not essential to have the fillings done as I am not in pain. (even though I thought decay grows if left) I do think they look bad, so what do I do at this point? Lie and say they hurt to get the fillings done? I do want them, but I cannot pay for it with being in full time education at college with 0 income. Also, to DocT, is ICON resin material I thing I can purchase at home and do at home, or is that something I'd need to do at a dentist? I'm not sure what it is, but it sounds like another thing my dentist will refuse to do as it's not essential, but more of a thing I want??Should I continue to purchase mousse if I am not seeing any difference? Or is it still making my teeth stronger? If I fully stop carbonated drinks and flavored water (that I drink frequently) will I see a large impact to my teeth? Thank you for both taking the time to respond Sonia Salamuri: It seem's that you have a very beautiful smile, it was very sad if you let those decays go on. And those drinks won't help if they also add pigmentation to your teeth. Acidic drinks will weaken the enamel, and, although you're trying to care your teeth with additional cleaning , at the same time, other habits could be doing the opposite. gary2019: I'm doing as much as I can to reverse any of the effects that I can, I'm now brushing and flossing after each meal, only drink plain water permanently now (until I see some sort of improvement to my teeth) and applying tooth mousse at night times, and sometimes in the afternoons shielded inside of my retainer. I regret my decisions that I made when I was younger, sugary drinks use to be my only drink. I am thankful I did not get diabetes any similar medical conditions like that with the high volumes of sugar that I had. And It is much more awkward for me to smile (showing my teeth) in public, or even for a photoI am just hoping that none of my teeth ever need extracted - that's what worries me the most. I just don't know if I have left it too late or not. Either way, I am going to continue trying my hardest, and I am still looking into ICON resin material what was mentioned above as i've never heard of that, and will try my best to get any remaining fillings done that are needed. MattKW: gary2019 said:\t\t\tProblem is with my dentist, I do get treatment for free, but only \"essential\" treatment.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...What I've indicated is decay, and is essential treatment. These are easy, quick fillings - why wouldn't a dentist want to do it? Can you see a different dentist?\t\t\tIf I fully stop carbonated drinks and flavored water (that I drink frequently) will I see a large impact to my teeth?\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Flavoured water has similar problems to carbonated drinks - both have sugars and acids. It doesn't appear that you will see further improvements to your teeth, but at least you're less likely to develop new decay if you go to plain fluoridated tap water (not bottled water).\nICON is not something you could buy or use as a general consumer. gary2019: When you say it doesn't appear that I will see further improvements, do you mean at all? I thought I can get rid of those white patches forming on my teeth myself if I just stick with plain water, regular brushing and tooth mousse? I have tried tooth mousse for a while now, but at the same time I was drinking flavored water and having the odd carbonated drink, so haven't actually tried just plain water.Also, why does it have to be from a tap and not bottled water? As for fluoridated tap, unless that is your standard tap, I don't have that. My current tap water I don't drink a lot of as you can taste the chlorine inside of it, i've had it checked and got told it was fine, but still unsure.I don't think i'll be able to do ICON, as my current dentist doesn't even do teeth whitening and some other options... I'll have to look into that.I have a new concern with these white patches, from reading different sources on the internet, they suggest white patches are a symptom of fluorosis? Is it not possible that I have that? I have been on high fluoride toothpaste for a while now... I hope I don't have that. MattKW: Why buy bottled water? It costs thousands of times more than tap water and is less tightly controlled. Some don't have fluoride. So you can taste a bit of chlorine, no big deal. If you've ever tried truly filtered water (like I use in my autoclave and water lines), it is weird because it has absolutely no taste at all. It is also not healthy for long term use. gary2019: True that bottled water costs more. But with me, drinking the water that taste of chlorine makes my physically ill. Not sure why, it doesn't have the same effect on family members. But there is many drinks that I cannot stand such as milk ect..\nAnd when drinking it constantly, for some reason I get like dry mouth and my tongue goes a weird colour and breath starts to smell, this is the same with bottled water however less likely. More of a waking up in the morning thing. Mouth wash tends to fix it.I know some bottled water doesn't have fluoride, but as mentioned above I'm concerned I could have or get one of those problems that you can get from having too much fluoride. Fluorosis or enemal hypoplasia or any other problem. Surely being on high dose of fluoride toothpaste and tooth mousse is good enough? DocT: White patches on the teeth surface can have different etymological roots 1) - MIH ( molar incisor hypomineralization) - histologycal defect of enamel, formed before teeth eruption, 2) -demineralization as the result of different events ( insufficient hygiene with excessive bacterial plaque formation) formed after eruption, 3) - acidic drinks, 4) - braces, 5) - fluorosis. Despite of the etiology and mechanism they all have one think in common - histological enamel defect, abnormal tissue formation and weakening of superficial layer of the tooth. In order to stop the process of distraction and restore histological shield - natural tooth protection - you need to rearrange histological pattern. You tried special toothpaste, that was a great idea often providing desirable result. You can try different pastes, GC tooth mousses plus. But if lesions surfaces are not permeable, it’s not gonna work. gary2019: Like mentioned previously, I haven't actually gave tooth mousse and my fluoride toothpaste a go as well as quit drinking acid drinks.. I'm giving that a go and just hoping something changes.I just hope it's nothing like fluorosis as it appears that teeth go completely white eventually and the completely discolour. Sonia Salamuri: The process of demineralization could lead to decay, so it's better to find a dentist that could really help you, and, if you don't like the taste of tap water, try to drink tea instead, with no sugar. But, of course, too much tea, like cofee could stained your tooth if the enamel is already porous..well, there's no miracles. gary2019: The main problem with \"my dentist\" is each time I go to an appointment, it's always a different person, who is not use to the way my teeth look, and think that I don't look after my teeth, even though I consistently look after them now compare to my past. This is why I believe they don't give me the treatment I should have. I can't just go with a different dentist as like I mentioned, it's free here. To move dentist, it can take up to half a year. What can a new dentist actually do? From what I've been informed, the only thing that can be done is ICON for demineralization... The only thing my dentists have done is prescribe high fluoride tooth paste for that I'm guessing.."

    "dialogue": "Quaker: Hello,I wonder if anyone might be able to offer advise.The last eighteen months I've been going private to have a some long overdue dental work.The problem I have is in the upper left. My wisdom tooth was pulled five years ago due to failed root canal. However, the tooth immediately next to it needed root canel too. This only seemed to be a partial success as mildly hot drinks would trigger pain. However, the dentist did a scan and x-ray and said nothing could be seen. However, this sensitive tooth was now being used to support a bridge, not the ideal foundation I know. So, I got a specialist root canal person to drill though the bridge and have another attempt at the tooth. She told me that one pathway out of four she could not get acsess to. This was upsetting as I am now living with a bridge supported by a tooth which is nervy.This is my predicament, I need to do something as its affecting the quality of my life enormously. However, the dentist said my  nerve pain and headaches could equally be a result of on going sinus problems I have as the tooth in question shares the same pathway. THIS I CAN UNDERSTAND, HOWEVER, IF IT WAS NOT FOR THE PAIN I EXPERIENCE WHEN HAVING WARN TEA, I WOULD BE INCLINED TO THINK MY PROBLEMS ARE SINUS RELATED.My dentist has said that if he pulls this tooth out he can't put an implant in as it's too close to the Sinuses. So it looks like I will have a very large space (4 teeth in total) on the upper left.I have got an ENT appointment pending, however, I feel sure the problem is with the tooth affecting the sinus, rather than the sinus affecting the tooth. I feel this way as the tooth is the only trigger it seems."

This was 3 days ago and it only seems to be getting worse. Can you see what I mean about the recession over only a few days? honestdoc: If it is not trauma, then it may be an autoimmune response.  We are only guessing without x-ray image, full medical history, etc.  Did you use a new toothpaste, oral rinse, whitening or any other mouth products that seemed to irritate?  Do you use any cinnamon, herbal, and or naturopathic products?  Stress from an overseas trip can throw your immune system off balance.   My guess besides trauma is herpetic (viral triggered by stress) or autoimmune response.  If the lesion is diagnosed as herpetic, have a doctor/dentist prescribe you Acyclovir.  If autoimmune, get Kenalog in Orabase.  If unknown and very painful, start with Acyclovir or Valacyclovir (don't use Kenalog if it is viral because it suppresses your immune system to fight off the virus) and if not responding in 3 days, switch to Kenalog and try to identify any source mentioned above and stop using it."

My last was about a month-5 weeks ago.I'm worried it could be an abscess and not sure what to do as I can never get the treatment done. I'm in the UK and the dentist has offered to refer me elsewhere for laughing gas but I don't feel I could go through with that either (I think I have pharmacophobia) and worried as to what to do now.It was very painful last night and I took some paracetamol which severely lessened it.

Seems to flare up later in the day, any ideas why and I know an appointment is probably the logical answer but what I should do going forward?Thanks!

Toothpain: Also appears to be making a hole in my cheek from the sharp bitdo you think it will need removal? MattKW: I'd suggest you have a dentist take an Xray. The wisdom tooth and the adjacent 2nd molar are tilted away from each other, and this can lead to decay between the teeth because of a broad contact area. Or it can lead to bone loss and a gap which might account for your feeling. Often I would advise the extraction of the wisdom tooth to prevent future problems with the more important 2nd molar."

    "dialogue": "patmich: I am having a continued problem with my root canal and crown. I got a root canal and crown in late August of this year (upper canine tooth). The temporary crown felt great. But then I got the permanent crown.  Soon after I got my permanent crown, it started feeling sore. It is sensitive to hot food. It is sore when I push against it with my finger, or pull on it with my tongue. It is sensitive when I am out walking in the cold weather with my mouth open. It is not painful. It's just sore. Not terribly sore. But the soreness worries me because it should not be occurringI went back to the dental office, and a senior dentist examined my crown. He did a 3-D xray. He decided to give me a powerful antibiotic which I took 4X a day for seven days. He said IF my root canal still has an infection this antibiotic will make it feel better. Well, the antibiotic had no effect on the tooth. It continued to be sore. I went to the dentist yesterday to update him about outcome of the antibiotic treatment. He suggested I see an endodontist. I asked him if I would be responsible for the cost, and he said yes. (I don't have insurance).Tonight I may have figured out what the problem is. But first give you this information: After getting fitted with my permanent crown, I attempted to put on my Hawley retainer, and it felt uncomfortably tight. I wore it for about a week, and took the retainer back to the dentist office and she did an adjustment. It was still tight. Brought it back again. Another adjustment. Still too tight. So I went and got a new retainer.  The new one is an Essex retainer.Tonight it dawned on me that when I put my essex retainer on, my tooth ceases being sore. The soreness vanishes.  The essex retainer covers my entire crown all the way to the top. Is it possible that air has been getting into the crown, and the retainer is blocking air from getting inside?  I told the dentist that I can put my fingernail at the top of my crown and feel the top edge of it. I asked if that was normal, but I didn't get a straight answer. I asked her if it was possible that air was getting into my crown, and she no. I think she also said that the tooth under the crown is dead. So I am here to ask you if, in fact, the tooth under the crown is dead? Are there any live nerves under a crown after someone has a root canal and the old tooth is ground down? Because I think air is getting into the crown and is causing the soreness I Thank you for your reply! MattKW: If you have had a root canal in the canine, then the tooth is dead and you should not feel hot or cold sensations. If you have a post-op digital Xray, post it up for us to see. Any Xrays of adjacent teeth would also be helpful. patmich: MattKW said:\t\t\tIf you have had a root canal in the canine, then the tooth is dead and you should not feel hot or cold sensations.

Problem is they get very bloody and I have to do a solid workout of flossing to reduce the blood(it’s like popping a pimple), as the gums want to be flossed as they are inflamed by gingivitis.. Thing is often I feel weak/even faint and lightheaded and crave sugar etc and salt which I do eg sugary foods or drinks/and electrolytes etc. I have type 2 diabeties to. But I’m worried by this and every time I do big floss and gums very bleeding I feel side effects after. Want advice please here why this happens.. I’m okay the next day or if I have a sleep for like one hr or so.. honestdoc: It is best to control your diabetes.  Left uncontrolled, you may experience further, irreversible gum damage.  Hopefully you will have a dental cleaning soon.  Your gums needs to be diagnosed by a dentist with x-rays showing the bone levels relative to your teeth.  If you have bone loss as well as attachment loss, you will need deep cleanings. DocT: If you recently diagnosed with gingivitis, it's a very good news. It means, you don't loose bone; not yet. In your case I'd try PerioProtect home care. It's periodontal trays similar to whitening trays, but for different purpose. Instead of putting there whitening gel (10-15% peroxide) you use 1.7% peroxide gel designed specifically for cleaning teeth. Benefits : 1 - tray distributes medicament evenly throughout the entire dentition; 2 - tray insures medication will be in a contact with your teeth and gum long enough to complete cleaning process; 3 - it will push cleaning component in hard-to-reach areas, like spaces b/w the teeth - your problematic spot. This method  was developed by dentist who's mother was in a nursing facility and had no dexterity to support her mouth hygiene. Just google \"PerioProtect\" and I'm sure you will find the information. Just remember, some doctors will claim this is treatment and can restore missing tissues. I recommend this as a hygiene product only. Good luck!"

MattKW: By \"tracks\" do you mean braces? Beni: MattKW said:\t\t\tBy \"tracks\" do you mean braces?\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Yes DocT: If your son grinds his teeth to the level of destruction, this activity is related to an excessive, spastic and potentially harmful activity of chewing muscles and braces are not going to stop / prevent this process. But from the information you provided, if only canines are showing a signs of wear, most likely it is not related to muscle’s parafunction - grinding - but rather traumatic teeth position. Your dentist suggested braces to move your son’s teeth into more favorable position and away from heavy contacts. MattKW: I wonder if you are talking about his baby canines? Any photos? Beni: No it’s his adult canines. Thanks for the advise DocT MattKW: I would be extremely surprised to see teens wear down their canines to the point of concern. And trying to adjust his chewing pattern by braces for this reason appears strange and unnecessary. Canines are adapted to take lots of shearing forces (canine guidance). Any photos?"

If you feel roughness, then you may have an enamel or dentinal fracture and depending on how big, you may or may not need a filling or just smoothing.

I told the doc that I dont want any xrays but convinced me to take 2. He ended up taking 3 instead. He said I had 3 cavities and he'd put in a temporary filling. He said in order for the hospital to place permanent filling he'd have to take 18 xrays. I asked why 18. He said because since its a student facility of the hospital its to help educate dental students. Wtf is this???This is the last time I'm going there. But I want to report this doc immediately. He's putting unaware patients at health risk for unneeded radiation. He needs to be reported on very soon. Where can I report him to?. MattKW: It used to be standard practice when I was a student at Sydney Univ to take a full mouth series before sending patients to the student clinic (35 yrs ago). Nowadays at Syd Univ they start with bitewings and take it from there following the ALARA principle. An OPG is quite commonly the next step. So I think your problem is more with the hospital than the specific dentist, and I'd suggest you talk to someone about your concerns, and ask if they can justify it if they are trying to teach the students best practice principles for radiation. And no-one can force you to have Xrays taken, although they may consider not seeing you as a patient, which I think would be unfair."

Well a year later that crown failed SO I went to a different dentist and last July had that crown replaced. WELL it hurt to chew on and about 3 months ago they adjusted it by grinding some off. Well a week later they did another xray and say the nerve or root is cracked and I'll probably need an implant. There was a piece along the inside gumline I could feel like glue or something right at the top edge, the dental assistant picked at it and said maybe it was where the old tooth was, she called it a shelf but today I noticed it was gone. Now there's a hole at the edge of the gumline. I took a pic of it... honestdoc: It is hard to exactly determine from the image.  In general, anytime you have drilling on a tooth, it becomes weaker.  When the tooth gets a root canal (the first time), the tooth gets so weak you need a crown to protect it.  From my observations, retreating a failed root canal is very risky and weakens the tooth even more.  I would give the patient the option of placing an implant instead of retreating."

I saw an oral surgeon and he decided to get the bump excised. The procedure was yesterday. Like you said, he thought it was an inflamed lingual tonsil. But he wanted to get it biopsied to be safe.

My two front teeth are lower than my other teeth and they also have these grooves in them (they kind of look like mamalons) I was wondering what these were and if it is possible to get rid of them (likely from grinding them down) MattKW: They're not grooves, but rather accentuated enamel allowing shine-through. Assuming there's nothing else involved than what I see, then the simplest solution is to place some opaque composite over the outside incisal 1/2 of those teeth."

    "dialogue": "Curiousb: I had my infected molar extracted 3 days ago and have a wisdom tooth coming through behind it. The dentist said that he got out all of the infection with the tooth and did not need to stitch it up or give me any antibiotics! Now the extraction site looks rather green. It doesn’t throb too bad and it tolerable with pain meds. It doesn’t seem to have a foul taste or smell. So I’m just wondering, does this look normal? Or does it look like a sign of infection? Thanks! honestdoc: The extraction site looks normal.  You can't judge color,  there are epithelial repair tissue forming in varying colors.  You don't need antibiotics unless you have swelling and or fever above 102 F or 38.8 C.  Taking unneeded antibiotics increases risks of resistance.  Your mouth heals very efficiently and as long as your pain is not excessive and have no swelling, you should be fine."

    "dialogue": "Jivey: Hi.Just a quickie question.I had an examination today because of absess under an old bridge and painful teeth, Ache pain, Not sharp pain.\nDuring the examination the dentist hit each of my teeth with a metal object/hammer.\nAs he started i thought it a bit odd. He hit 1 tooth quite hard.\nThis tooth did not have sharp pain before the examination.\n20 minutes after the examination and tooth hitting i started to get sharp pain when applying any pressure to this particular tooth.I think he may have cracked the tooth.\nThe tooth in question is the tooth next to the bridge which now makes my front teeth.Is it normal to hit teeth with metal objects during an examination ?Thank You. Jivey: I should say that after the dink on my teeth with the metal object the dentist took 2 x-rays. He then said that i had 3 options.\nKick the can down the road and take antibiotics (His own words) or extract the tooth (which is part of the bridge, Destroying the bridge as a result) or have an Apiceptomy. I opted for the later as the bridge was/is in his words \" A very fine piece of dentistry.\"Also i am NHS so i am wondering how much the Apiceptomy is going to cost.Once again, Thank you. MattKW: No idea how much an apicoectomy will cost - you should ask the dentist. An apicoectomy can be a risky procedure - I would get a 2nd opinion, preferably from an endodontist. Jivey: Thanks for the reply. Your words have been noted. j4kskateboarding: Ive had a dentist bang on mine recently for the extractions of front top teeth and it turns out that it cracked many others from the vibration of the jaw... and wow I dont think its standard practice unless they are trying to make a customer of someone. He even made me  swoosh a liquid in my mouth that tasted toxic and claims it was just the tap water from where I got it done. I suspect now that it was something to make the teeth weakened for that purpose... Im facing a lot of fractures now in several different teeth that have now became troublesome."

    "dialogue": "Rico99: Hi everyone \nI am glad I found this site I have horrific teeth due to bad genetics , accidents and drinking way too much Pepsi over the years . I have not seen dentist in 20 years  I am a very hyperactive person with extreme energy and anxiety . I am so afraid to see a dentist and of course embarrassed !! I have had  dental problems since I was 5 years old ! By my teenage years I already had 8 root canals and 2 extractions . Last time I saw a dentist I was 23 which was back in 1999 . I feel ashamed and ugly . Of course I have a history of bad dentists which does not help things either . \nRight now I have this concern : About 5 years ago I was stupid I took a very hard frozen piece of ice and put it in my mouth and chew it . I cracked the root canal of the lower molar tooth , boy did that hurt ! I know stupid of me not going to the dentist . I discovered a lot of hard  white Tatar around that tooth about 4 years ago , part of that tooth broke and I also discovered a lump in my gum line right  below that tooth . I am sure it is related . That lump is a bit smaller than a dime . It is somewhat  painful but sometimes I have no pain . This lump is relatively hard but it has not grown at all in 4 years , I feel bony cracking when I push against that lump , the same feeling when you crack your knuckles . The color of that lump is the same as the surrounding tissue and gums . There is no dark red and there is no white either . By the way I quit Pepsi 7 years ago and  started to be much more health conscious Here is my question is that Lump a Cyst ? or is it hard calcium built up under the roots and inflamed the gum area of that tooth ? An Odontoma ? An oral fibroma ? A buccal exostosis ? I ruled out an abscess tooth , I do not think that what it is . I have no fever , a great appetite and a high functioning immune system . I know it is hard to diagnose something you can not see . Any guesses and answers would help . I will go see a dentist , it is going to be so difficult for me but I have to do this soon !!! Thank you A_s: Hi Rico99:I understand going to see a dentist can be scary (I can remember this when I was a child/teenager, unsure what dentist would do to me, and all these instruments and noise). But please please know, there are dentists who are passionate about their jobs and willing to help you and they are happy they can help, instead of laughing at you. If you are not feeling comfortable with seeing one dentist, you can always change to another dentist that you are happy to work with. There will be at least one dentist there that is willing to help you \nAccording to your concern:\nWhen you cracked the tooth, the tooth may have been reinfected, and it is possible to have an abscess. But I cannot just say it must be an abscess because I didn't have all the clinical information. The tooth may not be salvageable, depending on how severe is the crack, is it still possible to do root canal treatment, is it still restorable, etc. Hope it helps. A_s: Also you will need some clinical examination and radiographs. Rico99: Hi A-s first thank you so much for replying I greatly appreciate it \nI have to wait until my dental insurance from work kick in . Yes I know I have to have X rays and maybe even other types of more modern radiographs . I have not seen a dentist in 20 years . I am sure there is new technology  I have so much work that needs to be done but right now I am just concerned about that hard Lump in my gum line . Is this pain excruciating ? No it is not but sometime I have painful moments I have been eating raw garlic and that has helped somewhat with the pain \nI am keeping this as a secret  from family , friends , neighbors , coworkers , my girlfriend , my daughter no one knows about this . I want to keep it that way until I make that appointment and I will go ahead and announces this dental secret  . \nI just need to find a good dentist who is very understanding . I have no dental insurance at the present moment  but come 2020 the dental insurance at work is very different than the previous years , it is an excellent plan .  \nYes I am aware of clinical examination and radiographs , U think it is more of a Dental abscess and not a cyst . As far as I know a dental abscess is different from a cyst ?? \nThank you again for talking to me !!"

Symptoms include burning pain in the chest that usually occurs after eating and worsens when lying down. When you wake up in the morning, you can taste last night's food.

I am missing a top molar on the right and a bottom molar on the left.  I know the occlusion there isn't good.  I sleep with a soft nightguard on the bottom teeth.  She I wake up in the morning my teeth feel ok only because they aren't touching.  I am wondering if I put them together to hard during the day and making them hurt more as the day goes on. honestdoc: According to TMJ expert Dr. Jeffrey Okeson from Univ of Kentucky, your teeth only touch 20 minutes a day including all meals and function.  At rest, your teeth are about 1 cm or 0.25 inch apart.  If you notice your teeth clenching during focus or stress, you are exceeding that 20 minutes and risking pain and possible teeth damage as well as TMJ dysfunction. John Roberts: Thank you Honestdoc.  We have talked on here before.  I am 73 now and until all this started I never noticed or paid any attention to how my teeth functioned.  This is going on three years now.  At rest mine probably are 1cm apart but everytime I swallow they come together especially the front teeth.  I do have a overbite.  One of the dentist told me that I have a overbite which I never paid any attention to.  My two front teeth are crowned and they are actually too long which I think makes the overbite look worse.  \nAnyway my teeth come together everytime I swallow and I wonder if that could be causing them to stay sensitive to the touch.  Like I said my bite doesn't feel right.  It does feel like my front teeth come together maybe a little too much.\nI guess my question is can my teeth contacting everytime I swallow keep them sore, or sensitive to the touch all the time and never get any better.  If that were to be the case I don't know what I could do.  Thank you for the reply.  I haven't found out much here. honestdoc: Where are you located?  If you live in the US, hopefully you have medical insurance.  Find a TMJ specialist (usually dentists with extra training) that will take your medical carrier and have an evaluation.   Pain associated with TMJ will usually be covered by medical."

    "title": "Crown lengthening",
    "dialogue": "TomL: Ok, I was looking for advice on a crown that fell out.  I was told I need a crown lengthening.  I waited 6 or so years to have 2 crowns done last year that had fallen out after around 7 years function.  The dentist who had put them in seemed to think that was a good life span for crowns.I am thinking there are competence levels with dentists as a fellow worker who had the same dentist last year complained about the crowns he had put in fall out and he had to go back to her.  She was very nice though.  I am in SW Ct, am looking for an affordable option.  As I have insurance that covers post and crown but not periodontal, are there dentists who have associates in their shop that does lengthening at a discount to make money on the post and crown? MattKW: Crown lengthening has disadvantages. I would be wondering about why crowns fell out after only 7 years. Get copies of your records and go get a second opinion. Or post Xrays etc up here for comment. TomL: Thanks for the advice; I went back to Newfield that did the work last year and then Shel that had done the work previously; I went to the dental school up in Farmington 5 or so years ago that insisted on doing all the cavities first, then told me I would need an implant into the jaw which I can't afford.  The lengthening was mentioned by a couple dentists as an option, but one in Bridgeport said that an implant would be necessary at $3500! Can't afford so won't get that done.  I would go to Breiner in Trumbull who is the best I have been to but he doesn't take my insurance. honestdoc: Like Dr. MattKW mentioned, try to obtain a digital x-ray from the dentist and post it here.  As you experienced, different dentists will give you different opinions...some more motivated by profit/production.  Most of my patients cannot afford crowns, surgeries, implants, etc and hopefully I can give you options as I would give my patients. TomL: I went to three places, here is one of the xrays; they all seem to want to do full panels but this should be enough. TomL:  MattKW: Those sort of small lower incisors with root canal therapies are very prone to fracture. So I think 7 years for that sort of tooth is reasonable. Those type of screw-in posts are risky as the roots can fracture more easily. There's no good answer hereCrown lengthening is only going to make the situation worse because you will take away some supporting bone of teeth that already have short and thin roots.\nYour best chance is to do cast parallel-sided posts with gold cores (all one piece). You have pre-made posts with pre-made \"cores\" that are for desperate situations - I wouldn't use them. Even with cast-post-and-cores I would be worried about the longevity of those teeth, and unless you have money to burn I would probably not advise it.\nA simpler idea is to just put in pre-made posts and build up with composite for cheapest alternative. At least when they fail you won't have spent as much as proper crowns.\nOr extract the teeth and put in a denture. A bridge is another possibility but carries its own set of risks - careful assessment would be required.\nImplants would be the only way to get some sort of guaranteed long term stability and strength.\nBTW, how old are you, and do you have all your back teeth? TomL: I'm 59, in good health, health food mineral rich diet.  Back teeth are OK.  For economic reasons implants are not affordable, $3500 was quoted.  I have insurance that covers posts, crowns, fillings, etc..  So an option is just re-doing the crown where it was, only better by a better dentist this time?  Frankly I would go to Dr. Breiner if I could afford him, he is the best I've seen in the area. honestdoc: The 2 teeth with crowns (not sure which x-rays are correctly displayed) have a poor prognosis.  The intact crown has root disease and possible root fracture.  It is most predictable to take out the 2 teeth.  I dislike most bridges because you have to drill on good teeth and when it fails, you lose those good teeth as well.  Bridges can almost reach implant prices.   My opinion is to consider partial denture and in the future consider implants.  Downside is partial denture can feel and fit awkward.  Separate discussion is on prevention.  Did you have trauma to the 2 front teeth earlier in life?  My main concern is possible grinding/clenching.  I noticed some incisal wear.  There is a possibility that grinding/clenching has the potential to damage any restoration especially implants. TomL: Probably right about trauma and grinding.Is a post and crown as is possible here?  I would go on a soft diet if necessary. honestdoc: Anything is possible but I'm fairly confident it will not last longer than a month or so.  No licensed dentist will attempt that.  The tooth with the intact crown is infected with what looks like a root fracture.  If you try to put a post & crown on the retained root, there will be no ferrule and violate periodontal biologic width.  Even if the post and core remain intact (for a short period without ferrule) you will have severe gum problems.  Consider a partial denture (different grades/levels/materials of partials and fees) and save for implants in the future. TomL: With these recommendations, how much would fall into post and crown which my insurance covers?\nYour best chance is to do cast parallel-sided posts with gold cores (all one piece). You have pre-made posts with pre-made \"cores\" that are for desperate situations - I wouldn't use them. Even with cast-post-and-cores I would be worried about the longevity of those teeth, and unless you have money to burn I would probably not advise it.\nA simpler idea is to just put in pre-made posts and build up with composite for cheapest alternative. At least when they fail you won't have spent as much as proper crowns.\nMy insurance only covers crowns, cavities, root canal, etc.. MattKW: You would have to get itemised quotes so you could then ask your insurer directly. But as I said before, trying to hang onto those teeth in the long term is not very likely. Maybe it's time to cut your losses and extract, then place metal framework denture. The KISS Principle is always best. TomL: Thanks for all the advice.  At this point I can't afford anything the insurance does not cover more or less.  I paid a lot last year to do the two crowns, one has fallen out the other is a little wobbly. John Roberts: It's amazing you can tell all that by just looking at the xrays.  My teeth have been killing me for three years.  Been to countless doctors and dentists.  My gp says neurological.  My regular dentist says he can't see anything wrong.  I have told him my bite doesn't feel right and he just seems to pay no attention.  Maybe I so have some type neurological problem but when all you teeth are super sensitive and hurt all the time I think something is wrong with my teeth.  I was treated for trigeminal neuralgia twice and didn't do a thing.  I am going to a orthodontist next week and talk to him.  I don't look for any miracles but I am hoping. MattKW: John Roberts said:\t\t\tIt's amazing you can tell all that by just looking at the xrays.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Well,this is a case more about mechanical failure than neurological problems which can be much more difficult to fathom. John Roberts: I have been to three neuroligist and one pain management doctor.  The pain management doctor labeled me with tn 6 years ago.  One neurologist said dental, one said tn and one said he didn't have any idea.  I have way more symptoms of o occlusion type problems than a netulgia.  My teeth are the same all the time.  I don't have attacks or anything that sets them off.  Sitting on the couch this morning my bite feels like it is more to the right putting more pressure on one of my lower right front teeth.  I am 73 s d just hard headed I guess just not wanting to accept this is not a dental problem especially after it started after a cleaning at the denist hospital with no trouble before.  I held my moth open a long time that day.  Did I get something ever so slightly out of place."

    "dialogue": "Cara1990: Hi, i'm new to this forum and am hoping someone could offer me some advice. I am a 25 year old and I still have my two canine baby teeth and one lower one. I have all my adult teeth which have grown round them. I have one wisdom molar on my lower jaw on the side of the lower baby tooth which has not come through (is it possible to have one wisdom tooth missing?)Due to my sister having problems with having a brace fitted on her own teeth, my mum refused to allow me to have a brace or any treatment as such when I was a teenager. I have always looked after my teeth, brushed twice a day and used mouthwash, I've never had and decay from my adult teeth all very clean. However regrettably I developed bulimia 6 years ago when I was 19 (my mum passed away, this may of triggered it). Since then my teeth have \"eroded\", almost shrunk in size and started crumbing and chipping and breaking in places. My two baby teeth have broken quite literally where the backs to the teeth have broken off, leaving very thin pieces for baby teeth. I have a lower baby tooth which the dentist said was \"hanging on\". I have since managed to stop bulimia nearly altogether. The damage is done though in my opinion. The last dentist I saw took a look at my mouth and said he didn't want to say anything but he could tell I had bulimia at the very end of the appointment as I mentioned it, tiny unusual holes & where there is no enamel left. The pain now in my whole mouth is excruciating and I can barely eat and I avoid sugar and acidic food altogether. I use sensitive enamel care toothpaste which is the only thing that makes the pain manageable.I have celiac disease which affects my bones due to lack of nutrients from the condition, so my teeth have probably suffered more from being weak and brittle, and I also have MS, none of this has helped but I am not working currently because of the latter illness, so I am on a low income and don't know how to get this treated. I suffer from a lot of mental and physical fatigue and sometimes struggle to take in information/function depending on how ill I am so i'm finding this to be a total minefield right now looking for answers on how to correct this problem with my teethThe fact I have 3 baby teeth in my mouth which I am guessing will not last any longer. The prospect of losing these teeth where I will have 3 large gaps in my mouth I find the thought very distressing and depressing. My dentist said don't worry, it's not right at the front when they fall out. When I open my mouth to speak it will be obvious, and to me so it is no consolidation really. Is it possible to get an adult brace and realign teeth in some way? My teeth aren't wonky, just my adult canines aren't where they should be and I will be left with sizable gaps. As for the lower baby tooth, the wisdom tooth has not come through on that side but I don't know if it's there or I only have 3?  Any advice would be very much appreciated. Thanks Plaza Dental Group: I would say a baby tooth like yours can develop a toothache and infection at any age without undergoing any orthodontic treatment. I think you should be fine getting Invisalign and don't worry about your baby tooth. The Invisalign could work and be gentle on the baby tooth as all aligner movements are very slow and incremental. Hope this advice will surely help you. evensmiles: Hi Cara. Unfortunately, fixing your problem has only one solution: Dental implants. Having said that, baby teeth could last for a long time if there's no adult teeth sitting underneath them. I've actually seen adults in their 30s, 40s and even 50s hang on to their baby teeth believe it of not. On average, these teeth go bad at age 30-35 at latest. Once the baby teeth get loose or infected, it's time to remove them. If I were you, I would start consulting with a dental implant specialist in my neighborhood right away. There's always one tooth that is in worse condition as compared to the rest. Start with this one. You don't have to replace all 3 teeth at once. If you plan accordingly, you can remove one tooth at a time and replace it with dental implant so you can extend your treatment over the course of 3 to 5 years. This way you can make small monthly payments to your dentist. If you ignore your problem then you will eventually lose all 3 teeth and get stuck with a huge bill! So in my opinion, start planning early. It sounds to me like you need to find a new dentist, one who specializes in dental implants and has affordable prices! The final question which you might have is what to do during the healing process? After all, it may be 6 months to a year to have each tooth replaced. My favorite option is to wear a set of clear retainers with fake teeth built into them. Basically, your dentist will make you a set of clear retainers that look like clear aligners. Then, he or she will fill in the missing gap with white filling material to resemble your natural teeth. You can wear these while your bone graft and dental implant are healing so you're not embarrassed by having missing teeth. Hope this helps and I wish you best of luck!

I decided the best option was the white filling which was £95. I am really not happy with the result as I now basically have a stub of a tooth which is not symetrical and looks completely out of place with the rest of my teeth. It also appears to be at a funny angle. Should I complain to the dentist? Was I wrong in expecting the tooth to remain roughly the same size and shape after this procedure?\nKind Regards MattKW: You'll have to talk to the dentist.

    "dialogue": "Question?: Hi , I visited the dentist a couple weeks ago to get tar tar removed from my bottom front teeth and she said my gums were severely inflamed. I was too scared to ask what that actually meant , is it serious ? MattKW: It means that the bacteria associated with the tartar, plus the physical roughness of the tartar, has caused your gums to mount an immune response. It's just like if you get a splinter in your skin - the body rushes blood cells to the area, so it goes red and swollen. If you clean your teeth, then the inflammation will go away."

MattKW: It looks like a lot of erosion on those back teeth. Are you a regular drinker of acidic drinks, e.g. soft drinks, juices, sports drinks, flavoured drinks,...? The tartar around the lower front teeth is minor, and the least of your problems. Samo: I'll have a single junk food meal a week, maybe twice,which includes a bottle of coke, and a cigar (no smoking otherwise)Other than that it's just milk and water and no acidic fruits, just bananas.Unfortunately they've been like this since I was a child, weak enamel, thin and just generally crap, same with my siblings which is why it was concluded it will have been genetic I think.I can cut out the junk food, and drop the cigar to once a month, but honestly I don't know what more I can do on top of the normal cleaning?How bad do the gums look? The last time I was in the dentist, she was really quite rude but she did say I had gum disese and my teeth would eventually have nothing holding them in honestdoc: The only way to diagnose your gum conditions are to take x-rays to view the bone levels and to probe around your gums for attachment depths."

I can't think of any scientific sources to support the theory.  It may be a difficult to isolate direct correlation vs coincidence with medical conditions and or neglect.  You can make an argument for those that don't take care of their teeth, won't take care of their bodies as well.   I worked on a patient who had dentures since she was 17.  The patient is in her early 50s.  Her quality of life may not be as satisfying relative to her peers.   I also worked on many patients who had dentures in the 20s.

Most people don't understand oral antibiotics don't kill the targeted bacteria after a few doses and many will only take it sporadically or when they remember .  It needs to be taken for a full course to be therapeutic.  If the infection has spread, certain areas may be very difficult for oral antibiotics to penetrate.  Depending on the severity, one may need IV antibiotics and possibly medical/surgical intervention. MattKW: Are you taking something besides antibiotics? Nandhini K M: Firstly, need a full mouth X-ray to give an unbiased suggestion. \nSecondly, Infections are like an ocean, and not everything can be treated effectively with Amoxicillin alone.

On that case, you are definitely worsening your health condition and risking it more and sometimes, life-threatening too.

I'm very concerned that when he gets in there to remove the filling, the tooth is going to crack and need to be pulled. I know this is a risk regardless. Tooth 17 was pulled a long time ago, and 19 was pulled and I have a dental implant there. If I do have to have 18 pulled, will the implant prevent teeth 20+ from shifting?2. Should I go ahead and just get it root canaled? I'm reasonably certain that there's so much filling in there that the root will be exposed when it gets opened. Wondering if it'd be better to just see my endodontist and get that knocked out. Thanks in advance. MattKW: Taking out the filling won't cause the tooth to crack. But if I see a large cracked filling like that, I worry that the crack may also already be present in the tooth underneath. You have to take out the filling to see, and then you have to assess if the tooth is still suitable for a crown.\nThe implant will prevent other teeth from moving.\nIf you have no pain, then the tooth will be a better base for a crown if it hasn't had an RCT, so try to avoid an RCT. The first step is to get out the filling and assess is you will be able to save it with a crown; an RCT is a secondary consideration. If the tooth will be too weak to support a crown after an RCT, then I don't start an RCT. What's the point in putting a new engine in a car with a crapped out chassis?"

They can't use that drilled out bridge anymore.  They will refine the abutment (teeth underneath the bridge) and take an impression and glue the temporary bridge in.  The dentist will send the impressions to the dental crown & bridge technicians to fabricate a new bridge and cement it back in your mouth when it is finished.  It is very labor intensive and the impression materials are very expensive which is why the bridge fees are so high. MattKW: Just drilling off the old bridge can take quite some time, and then you have to get rid of all the old glue, and probably have to readjust the height of the margins if your gums have receded."

    "dialogue": "snaggletooth: My front bottom teeth dig into the backs of my upper front teeth and I'm wondering if that damage can be repaired by drilling and filling. MattKW: It usually only becomes a problem in a couple of circumstances:If your lower teeth dig into the gums and start pushing them off the upper teeth - you'd need to see an orthodontist.\nIf your lower teeth are chipping badly, or your upper teeth are wearing excessively. This is usually due to lack of back teeth nad/or too many acidic drinks. It is sometimes reparable, but you'd have to see a dentist or even a prosthodontist. snaggletooth: I can't afford a prosthodontist. Can a dentist repair the damage? I use a night-guard when I sleep. MattKW: What was the cause of the damage? Missing back teeth or acidic drinks? snaggletooth: As I said, the tops of the bottom teeth dig into the backs of the upper teeth. Apparently the cause is Bruxism, but I use a night guard now and I don't grind my teeth when awake. MattKW: Then the nightguard will have to do. If you can afford it, get a cutom-made by a dentist or dental prosthetist; don't get DIY form a store or internet. snaggletooth: You're saying that the damage done to the backs of the front teeth can't be repaired with fillings? MattKW: Without the benefit of seeing you, in my experience it means that if you build up the back of the teeth, then that will open your \"bite\" and you will either have to open up all your bite (i.e. build up all teeth), or hope that the back molars overerupt to compensate. snaggletooth: Does this mean that if I go to a dentist he probably will not drill and fill the back of the front tooth? I'm too poor and too old for crowns. MattKW: Probably will not drill and fill. snaggletooth: What do you know about Silver Diamine Fluoride? MattKW: Useful for sensitivity, probably good for early decay. It cannot rebuild tooth structure that is not there. honestdoc: Silver Diamine can darken your teeth.  Another option is to lightly adjust your lower teeth so they won't bite heavily against your top teeth.

I am hearing some popping or clicking sound in my ears or near my jaw joint when I open the mouth and sometimes when swallowing something. I hear it only on the left side ears.

He said that's normal.\nI really don't know if I have donkey bite. Whether that's the reason for the popping sound? Busybee: It sounds like a clicking jaw.

Nandhini K M: Hi,\nClick sound will occur for various reasons. Yes, it is possible because of your filling if it has \" high-points\". This you have to rule out with your dentist. However, another major reason could be the eruption of the wisdom tooth ( if you are at the age of 19-25 years or even more and if your wisdom tooth gets impacted), kindly Check with that too. Malocclusion could also be a reason where your bite is not in proper order. This can be rectified with orthodontic treatment. You have to sort out the actual cause to rectify the issue. I have explained about it in more details in my page about the reasons for clicking sound in the TMJ, You shall also have a look on to it for an overall idea."

I get a.  bad taste from that area\n2. I never get blood from brushing but sometime if I suck hard or poke between the teeth I get bleeding it is hard to tell where the blood comes from I wonder if there could be something in the tooth some blood supply that bleeds\n3. I have been to several dentists none can be confident of which is the problem except when one put something on number 7 and it was very unpleasant / sore (four or so years ago)\n4. I feel I get a build of pressure in the area 6 / 7 and number 7 concerns me as there is an amalgam filling going down forming where the outer part of my tooth was and it looks to go right down and be in contact with my gum line. Is an amalgam filling in contact with the gum line some of a concern? I wonder if it could leak directly into my gum line.\n5. No 4 has been route canaled and I am also uneasy about route canals based on some of the information I have read, I am tempted to have it out. \n6. If I get any new filling in England what is the best material to go for these days, is there one that could go in contact with gum tissue. \n7. Between 7 and 8 I can get food trapped but I try to keep it clean I can go weeks without any bleeding just sometime when using tooth pick or floss I get the issue I think it happens most after trapped food that I have missed and later go out. \n8. I get no pain from the teeth.Any thoughts will be great Many thanksCharlieboy MattKW: Can't tell too much without Xrays. An amalgam in contact with gumline will give a better seal than a composite (white filling), and is to be preferred for deep cavities or cavities going below the gumline.\nBut the gum can only tolerate a certain amount of foreign material (filling), so you'll have to see a dentist for a fuller examination with Xrays. You can get digital copies of your Xrays and post them up here or via Imgur.com if you want further comment."

I recently switched dentists and they did there set of xrays, what I was wondering is the dental hygienist, not the doctor did my exam if you want to call that and rated all my teeth with periodontal numbers stating all my molars in all quadrants were 5 and greater that I had gingivitis and needed a deep cleaning and with my insurance is going to cost me around $500. I never had an issue with my teeth, but what I want to know is it within a dental hygienist scope of practice to give periodontal numbers versus the DDS. The DDS came later and never said anything else about my periodontal numbers and they are now trying to schedule me for a deep cleaning. so again is it within a dental hygienist scope of practice to give periodontal numbers? or should I see another dentist. honestdoc: What were your gum readings previously?  You can get a second opinion.  If the x-rays show full bone heights (no bone recession/loss), probing numbers should be low although x-rays are not 3 dimensional.  In the US, hygienists are licensed and are allowed to document their readings.  Some may be paid on production and may have incentive to over treat."

They are wobbly and not part of the actual tooth. My wife took our son to the dentist (in the UK) this morning where he said they were so wobbly that he simply tweaked them out. There was little blood and no pain but he did say he'd never seen anything like this before and they were either part of a root or a small cap that helps the eruption but isnt part of the tooth.Has anybody heard of this before, seen anything like it with their kids. Now they're out I can see the actual tooth nice and shiny and waiting to sprout.Thanks in advance, pics attached/belowEd MattKW: Don't know. Hard to say from those photos alone - hopefully it's not part of the adult teeth.

    "dialogue": "v0latile: Hi all,A bit of background: last teeth cleaning was last summer/fall and had no major issues. My teeth brushing habits at the time were brushing 2x per day and flossing a few times/week. Since then I've gotten a bit lazier and notice that I usually brush only once per day (electric toothbrush) and floss a few times per week (I know it's awful..and I'm not sure why I backslid into laziness..)\nLong story short - I was supposed to have a cleaning in February but missed it due to switching insurance. I still haven't been able to find a new dentist that is suitable but at this point I'm willing to see whoever. \nLately I've noticed that there's a bitter taste in my mouth. Even if I floss and brush several times per day it won't go away. I'm hoping its just telling me I need a cleaning but I'm petrified that it's periodintitis, that I'll lose my teeth and that it's irreversible.\nI feel extremely guilty and anxious that I've been ignoring this problem and that now it might be too late. Posting image below at the end of this post, can any dentists let me know if they have any thoughts based on the photo? and how quickly it can progress from gingivitis (if it was in that stage first?)I don't have any symptoms except occasional bleeding when flossing in the back molars (top mostly) and the bad taste. I don't think gums have receded but my understanding is that damage can all be under the gum?\nI haven't been able to sleep all night, unfortunately got sucked into too much googling and reading horrible articles about how dangerous this is. I feel like such an idiot for not keeping up with brushing enough  https://imgur.com/a/WkGf02N honestdoc: Unfortunately we cannot diagnose without x-rays and clinical examination including probing your gums to measure gum attachments.  The x-rays will reveal the level of bone attachment and if any bone has receded, that receded bone is permanently lost.  Gum probing shows 2 valuable information.  The higher the number (5 and over) shows greater gum attachment loss and bleeding which shows active disease and inflammation.  You can have bleeding and inflammation with no bone loss (gingivitis).  If you have bone loss, you need to quickly receive deep cleanings and re-evaluation for gum improvement.  If your gums improve, you must have regular maintenance and followup because periodontitis usually damages bone in spurts and cycles for life.  If your gums don't improve, you need to see a gum specialist (periodontist) for possible gum surgery or laser treatments.  Possible conflicts of interests with periodontists are that they make more money placing implants than saving teeth."

    "title": "Almost three years of referred pain",
    "dialogue": "Mark2675: A little info about myself. I am in my late sixties and have had issues with TMJ. Sometime in the last 2-3 years I started experiencing pain in the left side of mouth. It was infrequent and would come and go. It was never in an exact area. Sometimes in my jaw, other times in my lower molars and then upper molars. I could be walking or sitting and suddenly a crescendo of pain. It might last for a few hours and then things would be fine for days and weeks. My dentist would test my teeth and never find anything wrong. X-Rays would reveal nothing. The pain would disappear for a few months and then return. I would have my teeth cleaned regularly and the hygienist suggested I might be grinding my teeth. After one of the cleanings the pain went away. Then it came back. The dentist even shaped some of my molars slightly hoping that would alleviate the pain. It was suggested I go to a neurologist saying that I might have Trigeminal Neuralgia. I went to a local chiropractor who treated me for TMJ years before and his associate said I had all the symptoms of Trigeminal Neuralgia and they had a device that many chiropractors were using with success but the treatments were too expensive. I tried to using a mouthguard to prevent grinding. It didn't help the pain.I went to an oral surgeon who took a parabolic x-ray and he confirmed I was grinding my teeth at night. The pain became so bad that I couldn't sleep on a pillow on that side of my face. I was going out of the country for three weeks and I called my dentist to see me again just to see if there was anything he could give me to make it through the trip. Finally the pain revealed itself after almost three years. This time when he blew air on my one of my rear molars I reacted. All the previous trips to the dentist tapping on my teeth and blowing air on them the nerve never reacted. He sent me to an endodontist and when he went inside the tooth he saw what was causing all the pain. I had a root canal and just had a crown put in when I returned.I am so upset about this because I can't believe I had to suffer for almost three years. The last 10 months have been absolute hell with pain every day. As I am neither a doctor or dentist or knowledgeable in the the diagnosis of pain I don't understand how no one could figure out that I had internal tooth decay that was causing the nerve inflammation and referred pain. How can't there be any type of imaging device to reveal where the pain was originating. Have other people had similar situations. I am not looking to level blame but this isn't the 1800's when dentistry was in the dark ages.I just remembered and forgot to put this in the original thread. My lower molars became sensitive to slightly cold water in the last several months and one my symptoms also in the past couple years was when I chewed food on that side of my mouth if felt like there was pain below one of my fillings. In both cased the dentist found nothing wrong. MattKW: Pain can be very elusive. I had a patient who'd been to a dentist with pain but found nothing, went to a GP who found nothing and referred him to a neurologist. The neurologist gave him some hefty neuropathic medicine which did nothing, then patient went to ER and had full head scans, blood tests, the works - nothing found. Patient by now has now been suffering immensely for several weeks.Went to a GP that I know who then referred him to me for 2nd dental opinion. The fellow had very good teeth with no previous fillings or extractions. I found an almost imperceptible crack in a perfect lower molar - a hopeless prognosis so I extracted it and all pain gone. \nI have only ever seen one similar case in 40 years. And to make it harder for you, the suffering patient, is that the longer the pain continues undiagnosed, the more confusing the signs and symptoms become. Mark2675: When thinking about it now there were enough symptoms to pinpoint that it was originating in the lower molars. The sensitivity to cold water or drinks in that area and one of the original symptoms which was the feeling that there was a bad filling when I chewed food on that side. Strangely that symptom disappeared the last several months which was replaced by the sensitivity to cold liquids. I used Sensodyne during that time and it didn't help at all. It took the internal decay all those years to worsen for the nerve to finally react on the surface of the tooth for my dentist to find it."

It might be possible to receive a injection in your palate as well.\nA topical anaesthetic might be applied to reduce the pain of the injection, but this is very subjective from person to personMy advice is just to stick it out.

I had stain removal on my teeth a week ago and it went really well, I was happy with it, the first time I checked it, however, there was a small hole at the top of one my front teeth, which had the worst stain on it before. I thought the stain itself, which had been there for years, had maybe caused the hole, but this particular tooth has developed something else which may be linked.I woke up this morning, and the same tooth has now been discoloured most of the way down. It's gone yellow, and stops at the bottom with a small whiter patch. My teeth have never been fantastic in terms of whiteness, but that colouring was definitely not there before. It's only happened overnight, how is that possible?!What on Earth has happened? Has the enamel gone?

Some procedures can lead to sensitivity problems, nerve damage with resultant necrosis or irreversible inflammation of the nerve and discolouration. \nIt is important to remember that some procedures are very diet sensitive with some having a certain amount of time that you have to abstain from certain \" stain inducing \" foods such as coffee and red wine etc. \nGo back to your dentist and find out what has been done or can be done to fix the problem.

This can progress to a brown stain that is soft, but not yet cavitated, which is a more advanced carious lesion.\nWhen the dentist scaled with his scaler, it could have caused the lesion to form a cavity. This would have happened on it's own if left alone anyway. \nIt sounds like you might need a restoration or filling to be done on the tooth.\nGo back to the dentist to evaluate the lesion as well as the yellow/white part. Sometimes the yellow/white part can still be reversed before it becomes a brown cavity.\nDon't wait to long before doing this, since carious lesions can spread deeper and start affecting the nerve of the tooth. Dr. Ashmita Upadhyay: Hello, as you said it was a hole, there might be a cavity that is more visible after scaling. Get your cavity treated either by a filling or by a RCT followed by a crown."

    "dialogue": "Zamarko: Hello everyone, I am 21 yoI apologise for my english in advance.\nI went to the dentist after 3 years, when my wisdom teeth started hurting.They have found only 1 cavity and weakened enamel at bottom right part because of acid reflux, I had also and x-ray where they found that cavity, however all of my teeth randomly hurt and more when i feel that my wisdom teeth are hurting.\nMy teeth are sensitive to sweet (I can feel pain in my back teeth).So i would like to ask, is it normal that all of my teeth randomly hurt because of my wisdom teeth even front teeth?I had been at hygienist and I had lot of culculus, when she was scrapping it off, it was not painful. \nWhen my wisdom teeth are not pushing or not hurting i am chewing food normally and nothing hurts.Thank you for the answer and wish you a great day! Dr M: Good day,Firstly a proper diagnosis can't be made without any clinical photos or radiographs, but it is entirely possible for wisdom teeth to cause pain to other structures especially if they are impacted.\nPain from 3rd molars can radiate to your ear leading to earache, headaches as well as neck pain.\nIt can also feel that all your other teeth are painful, due to something we as dentists refer to as referred pain.\nIf possible, rather visit a dentist for a full evalution"

    "dialogue": "susan414141: Hi, I have a question ,I will make it quick,I went to get my teeth cleaned and she pulled open a bag with the instruments and they were wet inside,I never saw that and asked why are they wet,she said the steaming process from the auto clave does that to them sometimes. WELL HERE WE ARE,so my question is,is that truthful? also are they still sterilized if wet in package? and am i at any risk for anything? Please answer my question ,any advice would help ,even if its scary ,lol MattKW: Probably been through an autoclave because it works on steam, pressure, heat, and time. But they should come out dry. That autoclave needs servicing and certification. Or it's a cheap autoclave. You are probably safe. susan414141: Thank you ,I never saw them come out wet,I made the mistake of googling it and it terrified me,It said if they come out wet they harbor bacteria,is that true? and should i say something or just let it go to my dentist,i love it there Dr M: I can agree with MattKW. Some models of autoclaves, can make the packaging containing the instruments appear wet after steam sterilization and sometimes the instruments too. Usually they leave them out to dry. It might be that they were busy and had to rush and therefore did not leave them out. Some packaging is specifically designed to indicate if sterilization has been completed successfully. For example, little black stripes appear on the packaging.\n9/10 you are safe. But don't hesitate  to ask your dentist about it. A honest dentist will surely put your mind at ease. susan414141: wow,you are so very kind ,thank you . I do feel better and honestly ,that was kind of the 2 of you to answer. The internet can be very informative where it scares you and doesn't tell you they are worst case scenarios,again have a great day and thank you so very much  I remembered what the pouch looked like and googled that they have an indicator that shows pink to brown and it was brown on the top ,so ,it just didn't have adequate time to dry.

Here to help MattKW: Just to clarify: if they are wet, then there is the capacity to transfer bacteria into the bags, so they should be dry. In a dental surgery setting, it could be argued that the chance of cross-infection from wicking is miniscule, and that's why I say you'll be safe. But they should NOT be wet packs. So there's something inadequate or wrong with the autoclave.\nThe indicators on the bag are limited in their usefulness. they really only show that the bag has been exposed to autoclaving, but do NOT indicate if it has been effective. For that you need to examine the printout, and use Bowie-Dick tests or similar as required. Ask to see their daily records and proof of regular validation (certification). susan414141: ummmm,well,I guess at this point I cant worry about it,I know for next time to just leave and say I have a stomach ache,lol  . There isn't anything I can do ,they were already used on me ,What kinds of bacteria are they talking about? Hep. C and things of that nature? I did ask her and I wish they would of been honest with me and just said at this time we dont have adequate tools,but this was the first time ever they were wet,I did read some moisture is expected ,is that incorrect? susan414141: If I ask for all that stuff to prove there auto clave is working ,they may never want me back ! lol MattKW: susan414141 said:\t\t\tummmm,well,I guess at this point I cant worry about it,...\n\t\t\nClick to expand...The instruments MAY have been sterilised, but a wet bag can potentially allow micro-oranisms to re-enter. I personally wouldn't worry about it, as the chances are extremely low. But we don't know if they really have been sterilised, do we? All we really know is that they appear to have been through an autoclave. Nobody should shoo you away from asking these questions - I am always happy to show my processes and records. If they don't want to allow that, then I'd contact the dental board for an inspection. \nIn Australia, if an inspector comes out for ANY reason, he will also ask the dentist in charge to show sterilising processes and records even though it may not be relevant to the current investigation. And the dentist can't simply direct the inspector to a staff member; the DENTIST must know the details. susan414141: No we don't know ,but I'm gong to assume that they were , for the sanity that is welcomed,lol  I think I have a lil peace knowing that they were in a sonic cleaner,she may have threw them in he bag and grabbed them after that or they were never steamed ,I will never know, but as for now from this point on I will make sure all the instruments are dry and my dentist is so cool ,hes like family,iv been going to him since i have been 19 and this is the first lil scary episode ,so I WILL TAKE IT ! susan414141: Thank you Matt,for all the advice and Im glad to see your practice is so open and thoughtful towards your clients,thats a rarity! Have a wonderful day and I think my beautiful teeth and I will be just fine Dr. Ashmita Upadhyay: Hello, sometimes the instruments and the pouches remain wet after steam sterilization. And are thereafter left out to dry. The sterilization pouches generally have colour indicators to indicate adequate sterilization.so if the indicator says the pouch and instrument are sterile then you are save.

But modern regulations demand the pouches be dry when removed from autoclave.

    "title": "Sudden non-painful sensitivity",
    "dialogue": "fievelgp: Hi!    I'm hopeful to get some feedback before I make an appointment with my dentist about some sudden sensitivity in my lower 4 teeth.Saturday afternoon(June 1st) I had fruit punch slushie from McDonalds, and a few hours later I noticed a cold/sensitive sensation in my bottom 4 front teeth. Its almost a ticklish sensation. It's not painful and it feels no different when I eat or drink something hot or cold. When I wake up in the morning, the sensation is completely gone. Using mouthwash and brushing doesnt bring it back. It only seems to come back a few hours into the morning after I've drank cold water. During the day it seems to go away when I'm busy working and not thinking about it, but comes back again a little while after drinking my waterThe only things that have changed recently that I can think of are :   I got  Tetanus and Hepatitis A vaccines on May 30th. I had also been using Chlorhexidine consistently for about a week prior to this. My dentist prescribed it to me due to my front upper gums bleeding around my veneers/crowns, but I hadnt only been using it once or twice a week for the last few months until a little over a week ago.My teeth and gums look no different to my untrained eye. I notice no swelling or inflammation either. It has seemed to get slightly better over the last few days, but  how long should I wait for it to go away before making an appointment with my dentist?  Thank you for any feedback! Busybee: It's definitely not linked to the vaccinations you had.  For how long has the dentist suggested you use Chlorhexidine? fievelgp: Well, he gave me unlimited refills. I havent even used half of the first bottle though.Every cleaning since I've had veneers and crowns placed on my front four upper teeth, they bleed alot apparently. For the first 2 or 3 years, the hygienist and dentist seemed like they didnt believe me when I said I flossed them every single day. He eventually gave me the Chlorhexidine about a year and a half ago. To be honest , I hardly used it. I still had over half the bottle left when i threw it out . In February he prescribed a new bottle which I used about 1 time a week . I finally stopped being lazy about a week and half ago and had been using it every night until this sensitivity started.The sensitivity has been getting better. Instead of all 4 lower front teeth feeling it, it's now just the 2 leftmost incisors. Although eating,drinking, or touching it doesnt bother them I can feel a sensitive spot with my tongue on the gum just below the tooth on this inside Busybee: How often do you visit the hygienist?  Has the dentist checked that the margin on your crowns/veneers are good?  With normal hygiene, you don't normally get inflamed gums like that unless the fit is poor making it harder to really clean the area well. fievelgp: I go every 6 months. To be honest, I dont have complete confidence in my dentist in that area. He is the one that did the veneers and crowns.  I believe you replied to my thread in the cosmetic section a month or so ago regarding them.The hygienist mentions the bleeding to him everytime . And every time I get lectured about flossing Busybee: You really should get a second opinion on all the work you've had done.  Given your issues you should be seeing a hygienist every three months.  I would change dentists.   Try to avoid getting very sweet and acid drinks getting on your teeth and get a second opinion about the Chlorhexidine.   I'm not sure anything like that should be used long term.  I am personally against using mouth washes routinely as I think they are full of chemicals that upset your mouth's PH, but that's just my opinion.  Dentists here may have different views on mouth wash.  Apparently these products are championed by the dental profession (according to the marketing).  You should be referred to a periodontist who will be able to ascertain whether the problem is related to your dental work or your gums.  It could be that you have a genetic disposition to gum disease, but it could be your margins.  If you do have a genetic predisposition then you should be seeing a perio regularly for a proper clean and treatment to help manage the gums.  But a periodontist will be able to give you advice and the right products and treatment. fievelgp: Busybee said:\t\t\tYou really should get a second opinion on all the work you've had done.

Richings: MattKW said:\t\t\tA stump of a tooth remaining, and a poorly fitting crown. needs to be redone.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Thank you for your reply. \nWhat do you think the black bit is? MattKW: A gap between crown and tooth core that has not filled with cement. Richings: Thank you for this information Richings: I have a diagnosed under active thyroid ( I take thyroid hormones)but when that lithium Disilicate crown was fitted I suddenly became over active thyroid and gave me chest pains snd I was extremely agitated. Food seemed to activate the crown material and made me more over active with a racing heart beat. I have had the crown removed now and am back to under active thyroid which is normal for me\nCould it be that the void where there was no cement had residue of lithium in it or some other substance and an osmosis process was occuring upsetting my system?  I have allergies and sensitivities. It was a dreadful experience.  That x ray was taken by another dentist. The dentist who fitted that badly fitted crown failed to take any x ray despite me reporting to him having  major adverse symptoms from when I had the crown fitted.\nI am trying to make sence of it all. I wonder if you have a theory? Richings: P.S. I have other Lithium Disilicate Crowns which don't seem to cause me a problem.\nI do think I react to Lithium I was given it once many years ago by mistake and took one dose which resulted in chest pains and heart my racing just like the badly fitted crown experience. MattKW: Lithium salts as a medication is entirely different to lithium dislicate as a crystal glass. Just like hydrogen is different to H2O (water). A crown of ANY type will have no effect on thyroid function.\nIt's simply a poorly fitting crown which is going to be very difficult to clean with those crappy margins. Richings: Ok thank you.  \nSomething went wrong may be another substance I am very sensitive. \nThere is a study stating Lithium is Cytotoxic and not inert. MattKW: Lithium as an  pure element is extremely reactive, but you won't find it in elemental form outside of a chemistry laboratory.\nLithum carbonate is the medicinal compound, lithium disilicate is the crystal compound."

    "title": "My Dentist Lied about giving me an X-ray, ruined my teeth, now stuck with them because Insurance.",
    "dialogue": "DepressedAWD: A little backstory: I was raised with neglectful parents my teeth weren't taken care of as a kid, as I got older I was an idiot and didn't brush them plus have SEVERE dental anxiety and need to take medications just to make it through the appointment. They almost all have cavities and are in very bad pain so I finally decided to the dentist.I've been seeing a dentist for about 5 visits this past year. The first visit before he even really exams my teeth he immediately says I'll need braces even though I've never been told this the few times I did go to the dentist in the past nor do my teeth even remotely look that crooked except for the front 2 and its a very small slant, nothing poking out.He then probes my teeth and reads off numbers to the hygienist who logs them, I assume saying which teeth need work on but I don't know for sure as he never takes any time to explain anything to me and is a rush to get me in and out of there. He then sends me to get a cleaning, (and Idk if I just had very bad plaque and was overdo but I left there with way larger gaps in between them than I ever had before) The next several appointments he fills various teeth.With each appointment my mouth stays in more and more excruciating pain after the fillings are over. Last filling I brought this up at the appointment and pointed to a tooth that was giving me particular trouble. He said it was fine but proceeded to drill and \"fill\" it more, and I believe in the process of either filling that one or the one next to it he damaged another tooth.This tooth in particular didnt have a deep cavity and he made it so sensitive I can barely floss it without jumping. This tooth gave me no pain or sensativity prior to this appointment nor could I even see a cavity with this particular tooth.It's now been 2 months, I've been eating Ibuprofen like candy and my teeth are in WORST condition than before they were filled. All of my teeth are now hot and cold sensitive, I can barely chew with any of them not so much as a soft food like SLICED black olives it would send me through the roof. They sometimes hurt for no reason, or air hurts them or chewing wrong hurts them, or breathing hurts them. They literally hurt more than if I never got them filled.So I call and make an appointment for a new dentist at the same office. She sits down with me and I tell her about all the issues my teeth are giving me and how the last dentist shook them off.I know im not a dentist but before you defend the old dentist, He lied about giving me an X-ray.New dentist goes over my chart and informs me the old dentist gave me an X-ray back in march according to the computer, He did not and never has. I've gotten X-rays when I've had to get teeth extracted and she GAVE me one this appointment, he did not give me one then nor ever.Im trying to keep calm and plead with her just to please fix my teeth as I can't take this pain, I even say I don't want the others filled before the ones giving me trouble are fixed because if THOSE also give me issues, I will literally have no other teeth to chew with.She tells me she can'tAccording to her, I can't change dentists at this place because of insurance, she doesn't really explain but I ask her If I wait a large amount of time (thinking maybe it's because I just got the last dentist) THEN can I switch because I do not want to go back to that man.She fakes concern and says \"yes but we want to get your teeth fixed now\".If anyone needs to know said insurance its Masshealth which was with tufts but now it's called Care plus? I'm on SSI and too poor to pay out of pocket.Is there anything I can do? I don't want to go to this dentist again but I'm popping Ibuprofen so much and want this pain gone. Busybee: Have you discussed your problem with the insurance company?  If the practice have lied about your x rays perhaps they have lied about the insurance terms too.  Because it seems to me that the second dentist simply does not want to have to fix her colleague's mistakes.   It's not unusual for that to be the case in a practice.    So I would ask your insurance company what to do in your circumstances. MattKW: If Dentist2 said that Dentist1 took an Xray of you in March, then it should be on the computer too (not just the item number). Did she find the Xray and show you? Did you ask to see it? DepressedAWD: All she did was look up on the computer and say when he did the X-ray, The computer was behind the chair and i was so upset I didnt think to ask to see it. She ended up taking one and now I'm worried if I ask for it, they'll just give me that one to cover their ass. I have another appointment coming up and Im not even going to let the guy fill my teeth and  am just going to ask for \"both\" X-rays, is it possible to tell if its the same one or not? like are fillings apparent on X-rays so I can tell if they just gave me 2 copies of the same one?I figure If i can get the X-rays and have proof they lied I can call insurance since I have \"evidence\" versus just my word. Busybee: Yes fillings are apparent on x rays so any treatment you have had will be recorded.  I don't know the rules in your country but you should normally be entitled to all your medical records including x rays.  In any case there must be an external body in your country that can investigate your concerns if you think that the practice is behaving unprofessionally.    Any dental authority should be able to audit all your records and check whether any impropriety has taken place. MattKW: Sure, ask for digital copies of both of them and post them here or on Imgur. Sometimes it's possible to tell Xrays apart just by looking at them, and usually they come with attached metadata that gives the date. DepressedAWD: Will do, thank you!!"

    "title": "Sensitivity a few months after filling",
    "dialogue": "sefoxa: One of my rear molars had an existing cavity and filling on the top from years ago (exactly how long ago I don't recall).  More recently a tiny cavity developed on the back side of the same tooth.  The new cavity would occasionally produce a \"sensation\" - not pain or discomfort - but just enough of a tingle I mentioned it during a cleaning and they found something which was described as minor and a new cavity just starting to form.My dentist removed the existing filling, and replaced it with one that covers both the existing cavity and the new one.  Ever since then the tooth has been very sensitive - to both hot and cold.  I had mentioned it a few times and they said it would eventually go away - but after 3-4 months it has not.  I was back after about a month and new x-rays showed no issues.  The tooth is actually more bothersome now than when it had the tiny cavity, in which case it rarely bothered me if at all.My dentist basically said there's not much else they can do - he would refer me to some other type of specialist and said most likely that person would come back with nothing.  My fear is the tooth may be rotting/degrading as time goes on, and will eventually reach a point where it needs to be pulled if nothing is done.  Most if not all of the discomfort is from sensitivity.  Occasionally I'll feel what I would call slight throbbing, but not painful.  Based on what I've said, what do you feel is the most likely issue(s)?  I have considered going to another office for a second opinion, but I'd rather avoid any issues as I do like going to this dental office.  The other office may require the dental records to be transferred etc.  So let's start with online second opinions Busybee: It can take some time for sensitivity to settle but 4 months is too long.   The filling most likely needs to be redone.  If it were my tooth I'd go elsewhere because your dentist isn't being very understanding about your symptoms.   Is it a white filling?"

    "dialogue": "Joeb: Hello people new here! I am just here for some advice really .. I found an amazing dentist I trust around 2 weeks ago now and begun treatment straight away.. he filled a lower molar next to the wisdom tooth on the right side as the tooth had half of it broke off.. next to that tooth was confirmed to be pretty well decayed but hasn’t done anything as I weren’t having no pain but for the last 4 days I keep getting twinges there but my main concern is my right side as 3 weeks ago I was eating some chicken and all of a sudden I started getting what I thought was bad jaw pain or a bad toothache... was sick relentlessly that night as I suffer from anxiety pretty bad... fast forward 2 weeks later I have begun stage one of root canal on my first molar on the upper right side and a temporary filling bottom right side next to wisdom tooth, I only eat on my left side now as I don’t want to worsen the right side... but Saturday/Saturday night I started getting mild pulses/pain I would say on the bottom right side where the temporary fillings are but I’m thinking is it my wisdom tooth as that is the only one that hasn’t fully come through yet meaning there’s gum still over the tooth. My other 3 are fine to date (thank the lord) I’m not in unbearable pain but the sharp pulses I’m getting are getting me worried. I have an appointment with my dentist Wednesday to get fillings done on the temporary, polishing (whatever that is lol) and possibly a tooth out. I’m wondering if anyone knows what I’m going through as I’m clueless.. I may call my dentist tomorrow to see if he can fit me which he usually does to see if there’s any problems... I have just finished a 5 day antibiotics course he put me on to flush away any possible infection. I worry like crazy.. what would/do people recommend? Sorry for the long post Busybee: I'm not surprised you are having twinges of pain when you are having so much work done on one area in your mouth.   I don't understand why you had a temporary filling on the right side.  Did the dentist suspect an infection in that tooth? You mention temporary \"fillings\" - how many temp fillings are there on your bottom right side?  Because you must have a temp filling on the tooth you are having root treated on the upper right side.   If you have temp fillings in several teeth then they won't be so strong.   Even if you try to avoid the area you may end up accidentally grinding on it when you sleep.   If you try to relax you may be less likely to grind  But you seem to have a number of variables at play (including the wisdom tooth)  Perhaps you have x rays you could post? Joeb: Thank you for your reply busybee unfortunately I don’t have any x-rays I could post  .... the bottom right side the dentist said I had a small cavity hence why he has put a temporary filling, which today he is going to do a proper one, on the same side on the upper side where he has has begun root canal there is a temp filling in there yes.... but the bottom left side where there is a filling on a broken tooth is giving me twinges also... even when i sleep on that side, I had the filling done over 2 weeks ago now I’m thinking I shouldn’t be having no issues with it now I’m thinking?... been using 2800pm fluoride toothpaste for the last 4 weeks that the dentist prescribed for me so I’m not sure why I’m having these issues still... I have just finished the course of antibiotics to flush away any possible infection as the dentist didn’t see any on my x-ray but he suspected a possible crack in my tooth. Will update more today after my appointment Busybee: If you're putting all pressure on the left side because you are having work on the right then a broken tooth on the left may find that too much.    Hopefully once you have the permanent filling and root canal completed on the right the left will settle.  Have you mentioned the left tooth to the dentist? Joeb: yes I have mentioned it to him but he says that it’s normal to feel twinges after a filling as long as I’m not in “unbearable pain” but I will mention it once more to him today when I go... it’s annoying as one minute the left side is twinging and pulsing then it’s the right side... quite annoying actually haha. Yeah like you said hopefully after he does the correct filling and root canal or possible extraction then it should settle. Joeb: so I went to my appointment had no work done whatsoever expect for a mouth guard mould fitted which will be ready on the 26th of this month and also my temporary filling done then aswell, I mentioned the twinges I was getting on the left side and he said the filling looked fine and hit it with that silver thing they do lol no pain occurred but still the twinges are there... he said he thinks it due to me grinding and clenching in my sleep despite me saying the twinges would happen whenever it wants.... he felt my jaw and surrounding areas and said all feels fine.... I’m already taking tegretol (carbamazepine) upping my dose from 1 to 2 tablets starting from today in case it is my jaw..... also already been referred to the hospital on the 14th August to have a scan. So fingers crossed whatever has/is occurring goes away because it’s doing my head in lol Busybee: Joeb I am curious - what country are you in and is this private dentistry?    Is there a reason the scan will be at a hospital?It's great that you are getting a mouth guard.   If you grind your teeth at night you can get twinges during the day at random moments.    As you cannot control your jaw when you sleep a night guard should protect your teeth.   It's best not to worry about the twinges because the more you worry the more you are likely to unconsciously clench your jaw and add to the problems.  So it's a vicious cycle.    I found your original post hard to follow.  From what I understand you are having a root treatment on an upper right molar and you've also had a temp filling on a lower molar that was possibly cracked.   I don't understand why the dentist has put in a temp filling in the tooth that is not having a root treatment.  Has this been explained to you?   Is it to check whether that might also need a root treatment or to be extracted if cracked too far?  You should be able to request X rays from your dentist to be emailed to you.   They are usually quite happy to do this.  Posting X rays here would help a lot. Joeb: Hello there I am in England , I had a tooth out yesterday afternoon. So trying to allow that to heal today... been impossible to sleep to be honest . Going to try relax today. It’s a private and NHS dentistry, I am under the NHS, your right is it a viscous circle, the tooth that came out was bottom left where there was a broken tooth with a filling on it and that has stopped the twinges (for now and good) yes root canal treatment has begun on upper right molar. And bottom right molar has temporary filling in due to cavity was what I was told... hope this helps more. Thank you Joeb: Also the scan at the hospital is to rule out any jaw problems, which I’m not sure I do, I think it’s dental to be honest , I’m getting sharp , electric type shock pains in the stage one root canal tooth so I’m not sure what to think."

I have found that dentists near retirement do not necessarily do the best work.  Not always the case, but there is a reason they retire.    It's a physical job and with age it's natural that eyesight and coordination reduces, judgement can also be impaired.    Maybe you could ask your endo for x rays to post here.  It seems you have an infection of the antibiotics are helping but you really should not self-medicate because there's a risk you don't have the right dose.

Dr. Ashmita Upadhyay: Hello, the silver/black thing which you can see is not the post. It is the metal core inside the ceramic crown which is visible. The dentist probably had to trim away the ceramic from that spot to adjust the height and make your occlusion normal. MattKW: Hopefully you will not have further chipping of the remaining porcelain."

    "dialogue": "Tiffany: I had an extraction of a lower molar done on 6/17. I'm fairly concerned with the healing, as I've had an extraction before that healed up nicely. I got the stitches taken out after about 1.5 weeks, was told it was slow to heal, and a couple days later the socket legit filled up with red gum tissue WITHIN THE DAY. It's pretty much stayed the same for the last few days, MAYBE grew a little more but not too, too much. I see random spots of a creamy color substance but doesn't seem to actually ooze like I would expect pus to. I wasn't given antibiotics. In 3 days will mark the 3 week point. Also, I actually went into a different dentist today as my dentist is closed for a long holiday weekend. This dentist did an exam on all teeth, and told me I actually have  periodontal disease(she showed me in the X-ray where I've already lost about 50% of the bone in between my two front bottom teeth). In terms of the extraction, she said it's not uncommon to not get antibiotics, and that it's just healing slowly... But to explain the sudden filling of the socket she said I just have really fast gum growth...seems contradictory to me.I just want to give as much info as possible, attach a picture, and get some opinions. The picture is from this morning b4 the dentist & it shows the creamy substance I referred to. What's causing the slow healing (periodontal disease?). Should I have gotten antibiotics? Should I see my regular dentist as soon as they're open or just wait this out until my appointment next month for my cleaning?Thank you in advance. MattKW: Antibiotics are only indicated where there is already significant infection - I maybe prescribe 5% of the time.\nThe white spot looks like a head of pus. It may be simply that there are some tiny bone or tooth fragments working their way out through the healing (granulation) tissue. If you have no pain and no facial swelling, it will probably sort itself out.\nAnd yeah, your gums look poor and I suspect just from that photo that you're a smoker."

MattKW: Fillings rarely cover up cracks unless you are also cusp capping (or onlay as for Busybee). Teeth naturally function by wedging cusp against incline, and cavities/fillings disrupt the strength of the tooth. Merely covering a crack with the same size and shape filling will do nothing. Unfortunately, post-op sens after composite fillings is often falsely attributed to a \"crack\" (requiring an RCT!), or a \"high spot\". If you have pain due to a crack, a pathognomonic sign is pain upon release of biting pressure, not random pain \"...without any triggers...\".

He took x-ray for that particular tooth and he checked for cold sensitivity. He said it was a very shallow filling. I feel sensitive to crunchy foods after my refilling. So he applied some desensitizing agent on that tooth. He said that should improve the sensitivity.  He also prescribed the desensitizing tooth paste. \nHe told me to see for a week if that sensitivity subsides. If not, he says he will do the root canal with capping. He says that will solve the issue immediately. Also, he says this tooth looks healthy on the x-ray. So let's wait and see before we do root canal.He applied some desensitizing gel and press on the blue light as we do with fillings. And after that, he checked for bite and put on some water floss. I feel the taste as bitter. Does it mean the desensitizing agent doesn't bond properly?  I forgot to ask this to him. Why did I feel bitter taste?

    "title": "Issues months after crown...  loose tooth and swelling",
    "dialogue": "sohcsol: Hi everyone, new to this forum but I don't know where else to look for opinions and advice.  Sorry for the long first post, but thanks to anyone who reads it.Back in early January I broke my lower right molar on a popcorn kernel.  I had not seen a dentist since I moved from out of state, so I picked one close to my work that had good reviews and took my insurance and made an appointment.All went well at first, they gave me a temporary filling so the broken tooth wouldn't cut into my tongue.  Then I got a temp crown.   At this point I had had no pain at all in this tooth and could chew with it just fine.  But he told me that the break was deep enough that the nerve might die and I might need a root canal on this tooth eventually.Then the day came in late January that I went for my permanent crown placement.  When the dentist forced it down on the broken tooth it hurt a little.  Then I noticed it felt too high.  They said \"that's weird, that never happens\" and he went to work filing it down to where he thought it was OK, or until he couldn't afford to spend any more time on it that day.  I figured it just felt funny because I would need to get used to it.Well that wasn't the case.  I have bruxism and after a couple nights of grinding on it, I had a terrible toothache.  I thought maybe it had abscessed because my entire face and jawbone hurt on that side.  The lymph node under my jaw was swollen like a golf ball.  I went to an urgent care to get antibiotics and pain meds because it was the weekend, and the dentist couldn't get me back in until the following Wednesday.  When I went back to the dentist, he adjusted the bite for about 5-10 minutes and sent me on my way.After not chewing on that side for a few days it seemed to get better.  Then as soon as I started chewing with it again on soft foods, it was like the tooth shifted and suddenly the bite was way too high again.   So back to the dentist I went.This cycle went on for a couple of months, I went back about every two weeks to get the bite adjusted.  The dentist explained that the tooth could be moving because the bite wasn't right, I was grinding on it, or some other unknown reason.  They actually seemed kind of stumped.I looked up my symptoms online and they sounded like the result of tooth trauma, or periodontitis.  I decided to wait for several weeks after the last bite adjustment, since it doesn't feel too terrible at the moment, and see if the tooth just needed to rest so it could heal.  Well it's been four weeks now that I haven't been chewing on it or had any work done, and the tooth is not painful but it is still loose and wiggly if I push on it.  I can't chew with it because it moves and starts to hurt.  I also have had periods where the gum around it swells up quite a bit, probably after accidentally contacting it or grinding.I called the dentist again and he said I need to come in for an xray, that I probably need a root canal because the nerve might be dying.  We are now 4 months since the original crown placement.  I am wanting to go to a different dentist for another opinion because I do not trust him at this point, especially if I need a root canal.  I feel that the only reason that I am going through this is because they made the crown wrong in the first place, causing severe damage to the tooth ligaments and probably my jaw bone, which now has a big lump under it and feels sore if I press on it.  Any other opinions or advice I can get on what might be going on with my tooth would be appreciated.  Does it seem like this dentist was negligent in giving my an ill-fitting crown and not replacing it, but instead trying to file it down to fit?   The bite still doesn't seem perfect, if I bite down all the way it feels like it gets pushed out to the side.I am especially fearful if I need more work done or a root canal, because no dentist has been able to get me fully numb in my lower molars before. Busybee: You should definitely go for a second opinion.  Particularly as your dentist doesn't understand what could be wrong.  All teeth have a little bit of give to absorb shock but molars should not be \"wiggly\".   A molar wouldn't shift position every two weeks.  It could be that the crown is moving and from what you've said there was something not right when it was fitted.   Your dentist's comments do not inspire me with much confidence. honestdoc: Could you provide an x-ray image?  Did the dentist perform any tests like percussion and cold response?  The dentist appeared inexperienced...\"That never happens.\" sohcsol: Thanks for your responses.  The dentist did not perform any tests that you mention, he has just inspected it visually and adjusted the bite.  Now I am sure my gum is infected or abscessed.  I am going back to him today for an xray to see what it shows.  He seems convinced now I will need a root canal and that the nerve is dying.  I will not be having him perform any more work on my teeth, but he is an experienced dentist of over 40 years so I thought he would be knowledgeable.I'll see what he says today then go to a different dentist for another opinion.  It bothers me now looking back that he has not already done another xray or any other tests to find out what was actually going on with my tooth.  He has given no definite explanation.  Now I fear that the damage has already been done and I will either need a root canal or lose the tooth.  I also fear that I may have bone damage from allowing the infection to linger for so long.  I had felt a hard lump under my jaw bone for a while, it seems to be going away now but not sure if it was a cyst from pus trying to escape or just a hard swollen lymph node.My hope is that the xray looks good and its just a periodontal infection, then should antibiotics clear it up and my tooth be okay? sohcsol: Here are the xrays.  Image R6 is from January 22, right after the crown was placed (the taller crown).  Image R7 is from today.He says there is a 50/50 chance I will lose the tooth.  The bone around it has deteriorated causing it to be loose.  He says most likely the nerve is dead causing the infection and bone loss.   It probably died back in February when I was having severe pain and swelling in my lymph node.  We both just thought the pain was because the crown was too high.He wants to do a root canal to see if the tooth will tighten back up once it is cleared out, and I am starting antibiotics today.But, if it doesn't tighten up after the root canal, the only option will be extraction. honestdoc: You said this dentist has been practicing over 40 years.  I see a lot of problems both in x-rays and his discussions with you.  You mentioned he \"forced\" the crown in and quick to do a root canal without performing diagnostic tests.  The R6 xray showed the \"taller\" tooth with bad margins under the crown with the shorter crown with recurrent decay under the crown.  In the R7 x-ray, the taller tooth bone deteriorated unusually fast indicating a root fracture.  The \"taller\" tooth cannot be saved unfortunately. Busybee: Honestdoc I am glad that you posted with your expert opinion.   I am not a dentist and was shocked when I saw the profound change in such a short time.  Sochsol you should not go back to this dentist.  You should take legal action because this is shoddy work.    Good online reviews are unfortunately very misleading these days.  There are no longer any online sites where you can find out the whole truth about clinical work.    You have to go by recommendation.   Are you in the US? sohcsol: Thanks for your responses guys.  I will take these xrays to another dentist then.  Are you saying that there is no hope for saving the tooth even with a root canal?  He offered to do the root canal for free saying there was a 50% chance it could save the tooth.I also did forget to mention that he did a cold sensitivity test on the tooth, I could not feel anything on the one in question but could feel it when he applied cold to the crown in front of it.  Also the reason for the height of the crown is because when the tooth broke, the break went down below the gum line.  If it is a root fracture, I don't think it occured at the time it broke though.  I would guess it happened when the bite on the crown was initially way too high.What do you suggest my course of action should be?   Should I not bother going through with the root canal he offered?   Just go somewhere else and see what they say?Thanks again. Busybee: If you have a crack that is below the gum then you cannot save a tooth with a root canal.    I'm sure that some try but you're then going down the experimental route.   The dentist offering to do the root treatment for free realises he has messed up.  He thinks that legally it would look better if he offers to make amends.   I think you should get legal advice.   This dentist should not be in practice. You should get two to three second opinions.   That is the best course of action right now.   Don't give them too much background information upfront.  That way they will be more objective. sohcsol: Thanks Busybee.  I did schedule a visit with another larger office in our area for an exam, and I sent them the xrays with a brief explanation.  I am trying to understand better what \"should\" have been done, since apparently this tooth should not have been crowned in the first place?   Was it never saveable because the break went below the gum line?   And finally, if it is root fracture, what would cause this and is it not possible to save such a tooth then?It is looking like my only option now is extraction, just trying to better understand how I got to this point and what the appropriate response would have been by the dentist.  I am new to all of this lingo sohcsol: Additionally, if I were to decide to take legal action, is there a good method for locating a competent dental malpractice lawyer? Busybee: Teeth break because they have been under stress for years and suddenly that one popcorn kernel is the last straw.    But if it is broken below the gum a dentist should realise this based on symptoms and tests.  Then they should realise it because they start to prepare for a crown and they can see there is a problem.   Sometimes a dentist who has been practising for 40 years no longer has good eyesight or doesn't have the most up to date training or equipment because they have not invested in their business.   It's a very physical job and although some dentists carry on way into their 70s that's not always wise given the physical and mental changes that the body goes through during the ageing process.   Instruments slip and damage dental tissue or surrounding teeth, hands shake, judgement is impaired.   Along with other professionals dentists don't always realise they have limitations.   It becomes complex to correct long sight and that might make it harder to spot faults.  Just generally the brain slows down.  Anyway I hope you do find some redress and that you are back to dental health soon.  Hopefully your insurers will pay for any implant you need.  Do update on the second or third opinions. Busybee: sohcsol said:\t\t\tAdditionally, if I were to decide to take legal action, is there a good method for locating a competent dental malpractice lawyer?\n\t\t\nClick to expand... I can't advise you because I am in the UK and I think you are in the US.   But to find a good lawyer I suppose the best way would be to research recent cases that have been successful.   In the Uk that is information that is usually available to the public.   We have regulatory authorities that strike dentists off when they are found guilty of misconduct.    Case histories are the way to go.  Then look to who was the winning lawyer. honestdoc: This is just opinion since I have no law degree/license other than knowing a few attorneys.   I don't think you have a legal case.  Most lawyers in the US will not touch dental cases unless they know they will collect more than $100,000 because it is a waste of their time.  You may get an unqualified, new graduate, starving attorney that will take your case.  In the US, if you win $100,000, the plaintiff lawyer gets around $40 k, you pay about $47-48K in taxes and keep the remainder.  There is no proof he caused the root fracture.  You did mention of grinding your teeth which can cause root fracture. Busybee: In the UK they focus on negligence.  It would not be about the dentist causing the fracture, but his failure to spot it via symptoms and treat it accordingly.   The trauma that ensued through poor diagnosis and treatment.  The financial loss.  The loss of bone through failure to diagnose, which may make implants less successful.  There are so many angles.   Here you don't pay if the lawyer does not win the case.  They take on a case only if they think they have a good chance of winning.   If you were in the UK they would take this case.  The US has certainly changed. sohcsol: Thanks for the information.  I have been thinking about whether I would have a legal case or not.  There are quite a few unknowns where, depending on the competency of lawyers on either side it could go either way as to who is at fault.   I think that the dentist should have done more thorough tests to see what was going on, but at the same time he might blame me for not describing my symptoms or complaining about the pain I was in as much as maybe I should have?   I don't know.  I imagine they would want to settle it out of court, but yeah probably wouldn't be enough in it for an attorney.That said, I am a week into taking my antibiotic and the gum around the tooth is still very inflamed, and I still cannot bite all the way together without that tooth getting pushed sideways in a way that is painful.  I am seeing a different dentist Wednesday and hope they can shed some more light on what could happen.  I know it is possible that jaw bone can regenerate but at this point I don't want to go through any more trouble with this tooth, would almost rather it just be removed. Busybee: In terms of liability you have pretty clear clinical evidence with those x rays that the dentist missed something important here.   They do not blame you for not complaining enough about pain.  The fact that he knew something wasn't right just after fitting, having to keep filing down what should have been made properly by the lab.  Surely he should have seen some alarm bells right away and should not have fitted it but sent it back.  It's possible the impression he sent the lab were wrong and he was not alert enough to check them.   Or the lab made a faulty fitting crown, but again that is down to the dentist to check and return if it's not a good fit.    Try to get your medical records including any models and take these to another dentist to examine.   If you lose the tooth because of this then you should take action.   Let us know how  you get on with the new dentist. Busybee: Take action before he retires! sohcsol: Lol thanks.  I have contacted an attorneys office who deals with medical and dental malpractice and they are giving me a free consult to see if we may have a case.  If anything it would be nice to help prevent anyone else from having to suffer due to his negligence.And yeah I didn't go into much detail about the process when they made the crown initially.  They used some 3D scanning device to scan my upper and lower teeth.  It took them quite a while and they started to get frustrated with the equipment, not sure why.  Also not sure how this works since A) my original tooth was already broken and B) they never had me bite together when using the device, so how would it know where the limit should be for my bite?   But anyway, yeah the crown was a total failure.    From everything I've read, he should have redone the crown completely once they saw that it wasn't right.   I've had several other crown in the past and never had a problem, though they were all made by using a bite impression and mold. Busybee: sounds like you have a good case.  Make sure you act while the evidence is still in situ."

    "dialogue": "Skittles123: I haven't been to the dentist in a long time but was finally able to go recently. They said I need a deep cleaning/root scaling and 9 cavities filled. My question is, is it ok to have the cavities filled before they do the deep cleaning? I'm worried about having composite fillings done on my front teeth and then having my teeth cleaned and the composite fillings no longer matching my teeth. Will the deep cleaning actually change the current color of my teeth? Especially since its been so long since I've had a professional cleaning done? I would just do the cleaning first to be safe,il but the first available appointments for the cleaning aren't until late July and I can get my fillings done next week. I really dont want to wait until late July or aug to have my fillings taken care of,  but I certainly don't want fillings that are noticeable becauae they don't match my tooth color. Any advice someone with experience could give me would ve greatly appreciated! Busybee: It's not likely that a deep clean will significantly change the colour of your teeth unless they are badly stained with something like tobacco.     But if you are worried do not have the front teeth done now.  If you are having fillings done on both front and back teeth then you can always have the back teeth done now and the front after your deep clean.   It's very important to get the colour right on front teeth.  Can't you have the deep clean done elsewhere?"

I went back a couple of times and had the filling shaved and it was better. However anytime I eat anything small and hard it hits the two back molars in between in a way it hurts my teeth. It does not hurt my root at all and i do not believe it is the filling. Another dentist in the office said the fillings looked fine including my dentist who did them. They do look okay. I can eat steaks, chicken, some chewy things etc. But say I eat ice cream with jimmies (which I cannot now) and the jimmy hits the one cusp down to the two teeth they hurt. I have been back countless times and all really looks okay. Could it be because my tooth structure changed there? Both fillings are in between the teeth there.

I would like to know how it is done in your country.\nThank you very much!\nSalamuri Busybee: They only worry about having separate waste/filters for amalgam here.  But I'm sure there is a market for having separate hazardous domestic and clinical waste drainage systems.   Chemical manufacturers must have systems in place that could be shared with other industries. MattKW: Disinfectants are not used in ultrasonic baths; you should be using a detergent or enzyme-based product. It's purpose is to remove minute debris, not to disinfect or sterilise. Before instruments are placed in the bath, they should already have been scrubbed of most heavy debris (which goes down the sink). What product are you using? Sonia Salamuri: MattKW said:\t\t\tDisinfectants are not used in ultrasonic baths...  What product are you using?\n\t\t\nClick to expand... Hello! Thank you for your reply!\n You are right, it is an enzyme-based product. I'm still studying to work as a dental assistant,  and I've worked for one month in a clinic to achieve practical experience.  The truth is that I saw many wrong practices there, mostly because of a lack of knowledge from other assistants or wrong teaching. The term \"disinfectant\" was used to refer the liquid for the ultrasonic. So, I used the wrong term. \n I clean the instruments before putting on the ultrasonics, but many don't do this correctly. So, I used to change the liquid every time there was a surgery or tooth extraction to avoid that debris you were referring, and cross infection. (I couldn't actually say that I was doing that, because the colleague didn't like any \"suggestion\" from someone with no experience...) They usually clean with water the instruments after they were removed from the ultrasonic, with no other \"detergent\". Is this correct? I mean, the cleaning was to see if any organic residue was still there, but shouldn't be used something else besides water?\nThank you for your help!Salamuri Sonia Salamuri: Busybee said:\t\t\tThey only worry about having separate waste/filters for amalgam here.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nThank you for your reply.\nThey do the same here, along with needles, anestubes (not sure about the term in English) and surgical cutting material.

I attached both camera photos and X-Ray images here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CdVF3kEsiJ1_C7L3fuTk1q_E-fBWjGabPlease let me know which tooth is main priority to fix first, to prevent it causing pain. Right now I’m not experiencing urgent pain yet, however I need to be very careful with how I eat. I am only eating from the left side of  my mouth, because if I use the right side one of the teeth may hurt.A while ago my dentist mentioned my right side has a tooth that needs to be pulled/ removed, which I believe will cost a lot, so I won’t fix that one yet, since as long as I don’t use right side of my mouth, it doesn’t cause pain for now. What do you suggest is my next top priority tooth, judging from the pictures I shared?I am on a very tight budget, only have a few hundred dollars (Canadian currency) to pick one tooth. I need to have best strategy on how to use this budget carefully. Is there some very basic/ temporary fix I can get?Since I am only using the left side of my mouth to eat, I am constantly worried those teeth will wear out/ deteriorate much faster, as a few of those existing teeth are already not in the best shape.If I can only afford a few hundred dollars per month (Canadian currency), what would be your best strategy to maintaining/ fixing my current teeth, to prevent pain from happening, according to priority?Please include name of suggested methods (e.g. temporary filling, root canal, crown, etc.), and/ or estimated price, if possible, as I don’t know about dentistry. Thanks Sonia Salamuri: Wow, looks that it's quite expensive to go to the dentist where you are, in my country also the same, but it's getting better if a person has insurance that covers some or half the treatments. It´s very sad because our health starts also from our mouth and the care we give to our teeth, and it´s not easy to do this treatment regularly.

Dr M: Best case scenario, is that you will need a small filling. Based on your symptoms, it sounds like the nerve might be irritated due to the caries. If the nerve is reversibly inflammed, it most likely means, that you will need just a filling. But if the pain becomes spontaneous and lingers, it might be that nerve is irreversibly damaged, in which case a root canal would be a likely result.\nIt's best to not wait too long. \nThe longer you wait, the more expensive the treatment becomes."

However I actually was brushing my teeth but not that much like I would wish, (sometimes 10 times a month, sometimes never=this mostly)\nThe lose of enamel on my front teeth started when I was 13 yo and it stayed like this until now (no decay)\nI have teeth sensitivity when I breat cold air through mouth, eating cold food, eating high sugary stuff like chocolate. However when im hitting teeth with an item, it does not hurt and also when eating something like cereals or chewing a gum also makes no pain.Diet: I have never drunk soda drinks (occasionaly), I am no smoker, I dont drink alcohol. I stayed away from sugary food like candies etc. as much as possible. I was not at dentist for 4 YEARS, and it was a big mistake because I would be brushing if I was going to visit him regurarly.I know I have damaged enamel, but do you think the yellow colour is actually dentin and my enamel wore off totally or its just from not brushing?I know I cant turn back the time and I regret this everyday when I started brushing full time.Im adding more photos, it actually looks different all time when photographed at different places.I am now using charcoal paste, high fluoride and other mineral paste (I know enamel cant be repaired).What do you think of my teeth? Can you give me any advices or is it possible atleast to turn them more white? Can you tell me what probably will happen to me in few years? Any possible treatments?I want to thank for all comments, it means a lot for me. Busybee: I think you have nice teeth that look healthy and are are normal colour.  I would avoid abrasive pastes.If you are really unhappy you could of course have them bleached but I do not think bleaching is good for teeth.  Many dentists may disagree and it's a big industry (also I have not met many dentists who have bleached teeth!),  I've had it done once and I would not do it again as it did not feel \"healthy\".   It can increase sensitivity and it's only temporary so in my view  a waste of time if you have to keep having it repeated (and pay for that).So your teeth look fine. MattKW: Teeth are naturally shades of yellow, grey, red (see Classic colour chart here). The myth is that white teeth equates to healthiness, and this is largely driven by marketing and all those ghastly Hollywood smiles. From the limited photos you proved, I see no enamel loss, and think your teeth are natural-looking.\nIf you want to whiten them, then it is safe to do so (speaking as a dentist). There is some sensitivity during the process, but this can be controlled with desensitising toothpastes, and it will fade away afterwards. ( I attach a sheet here that I give to my patients). Charcoal toothpastes or any whitening toothpastes do not work at all.\nI worry that you do not clean your teeth. Even brushing and flossing alone without toothpaste is useful. There are some fluoridated plain toothpastes on the market, but can be hard to find, and I have no idea of what's available in your area."

    "dialogue": "aarongoldstein: I'm getting a little nervous because when I start my own practice how will I get patients? Are there certain marketing strategies that work well for growing a practice? MattKW: A lot of social media like Facebook and website stuff nowadays. Never found print media like newspaper ads to be worth it. Mailouts can be a reasonable way. Get involved with local Chamber of Commerce and other networking groups too. Kaushik: Hey aarongoldstein, The best way to market a dental practice in this day and age is through social media. I'll give you 6 steps below to grow your practice.1. Website: Your website should be your main source of traffic as 77% percent of patients use online searches while looking for a new dentist. The website should be optimised with appropriate keywords and should have the correct backlinks for great SEO. The site should also have plenty of calls to action(like book an appointment) as the patient needs to see it multiple times before they actually click on one2. SEO: This is by far the best way to get new patients. SEO basically ranks your website higher in the google search list. For e.g: if you have great SEO, when patients search for \" Dentists in (your city)\" or \"Dentists near me\" you'll be in the top search and guess what, they'll definitely be coming over to your site.3. Blog: Every dental practice should have a blog as its great in educating the patients and allows you to position yourself as the expert4. Content Marketing: Posting regular content on your website and social media channels like FB and Instagram is great for branding5.

    "dialogue": "tuxedodragon: I had tooth pain in my left front tooth. Its fluctuated and isn't unbearable. But there is puss coming out of it.So I went to aspen dental and discovered I have early gingivitis. My four front teeth also need root canals due to infections. They gave me a quote for 10,000 dollars.The problem is my dental insurance only will give me a 1000 dollars for dental work. I qualified for 5400 in financing. Because I still had to pay a signifant amount in out of pocket expenses that I didn't have, they told me I could save money by just taking care of the two really bad ones.So now my insurance and the financing will cover everything. But I will have to pay 110 dollars a month for 60 months. Which is hard for me. Not to mention that they will probably treat me for other things. Which I just don't see how I will afford.The first apointment was free. But I have heard bad things about aspen dental, so I went in skeptical. I don't doubt that I have serious issues that need to be dealt with. I just want to make sure they aren't over charging me.I was gonna make an appointment for next tuesday but they had to put a 2000 dollar deposit from my finacing. The finacial person told me I could get that refunded if I cancelled. When I told her I wanted to get a second opinion, she assured me that the dentist was the one who owned the local chain was was very experianced. Also their prices are very competive. She ended up going back to talk to the dentist and he told her to tell me that he didn't want to make me wait a week with the infection, so he offered me an appointment on Wednesday ( just a few days from now). I am officially booked but I told the financial person that I would tell her if I was canceling tommarrow. .I would like to get a second opinion. But with my work schedule and the the holiday this Monday, I am worried it would take a few weeks to get looked on. I don't know if I'd be risking things getting worse. I am not in unbearable pain right now and I did get my x-rays at Aspen printed out just in case. But I also don't want to burn my bridges with them if the other dentists aren't any better. They did give me a prescription for antibotics MattKW: Ask them for digital copies of your Xrays so that you can put them up here properly. A photo is useless. The Xray software can easily export images to a flash drive (or CD) as JPG or TIFF.\nYou can also then take those images to another dentist for 2nd opinion. Don't take that printout and expect anyone to be able to see a good image.\nThey're putting the hard sell on you because you think you're in a corner. Don't rush in - would you buy a car from the first car lot you went to? honestdoc: Aspen will send you digital x-rays through your email.  You need to go there to fill a form to request them. Busybee: That's a lot of money for four front teeth because root treatment in a front tooth is less complex as there's just one root.  Presumably they plan to crown them.  You should definitely get a second opinion because you don't want to waste your money but more importantly it's a lot of trauma to have so much work done at once.    Get the x rays, post them here, but also get a second opinion.  Did they not even give you some antibiotics?    It's important to get this treated but don't be rushed into something, be informed and be sure you need so much work done.  Get a proper diagnosis from at least two other dentists.   Experience means nothing.  Reputation is what is important."

    "dialogue": "bordor: I had a molar extracted in 2014.The next time I saw a dentist he noted  a crack on the remaining molar on that side. (A tooth which also has a couple of old amalgam fillings.)  Unfortunately at that time I did not make a connection between this fracture and the extraction. I don't remember being informed damage to the neighboring tooth was possibility. So it never occurred to me to return to the surgeon who did the extraction to bring this up as an issue.I have now and then noticed sensitivity in the tooth (from exposure to hot/cold) but it was never really bad, and only very intermittent. But earlier today I bit down on a piece of gum on that molar, and felt an extremely sharp pain which lingered afterward for awhile, even after I stopped chewing. No previous discomfort I experienced in this tooth was anything like this bad, and this just happened out of the blue. The night before I had been chewing gum as well, yet no pain whatsoever.I am wondering if the surgeon who extracted my tooth in 2014 could have accidentally as a result of the force applied caused a crack in the neighboring tooth during the procedure? If so what is the best thing for me to do under the circumstances, given that now a few years have passed?As a side question, is chewing gum a concern if you have a cracked tooth? can it make the crack worse?\nThanks for your feedback! MattKW: Rather than the surgeon having inadvertently damaged your too0th, it is much more likely that:The remaining tooth is now taking a greater chewing load and is more prone to fracture;\nThe remaining tooth has already been filled, and this always makes teeth more likely to fracture as time goes on. It is very rare for an unfilled tooth to fracture.\nDon't chew gum if your teeth have existing fillings. Go see a dentist if the sensitivity continues."

    "dialogue": "maxim1477: I just got several diagnoses that differ somewhat from one another, so I'm turning to you to find out what thoughts you have about the tooth depicted in the photo. Do you see anything wrong with the tooth? What do you see in the tooth, besides the filling? Do you detect any inflammation or anything out of the ordinary?Thanks in advance. honestdoc: I see root canals that are poorly filled with an abscess at the distal root (right side root tip with a dark spot).  If the tooth is asymptomatic, you are lucky.  If you want a more definitive result, have a endodontist (root canal specialist) retreat (redo) the root canal under microscope to check for fractures, extra roots, damage, etc and have your dentist place a crown.  Otherwise you can leave it alone or extract it. maxim1477: Thank you very much for the answer! Could you please answer one more question? Do you see anything else, perhaps a cavity, in this picture? honestdoc: Tooth #3 (in US), #16, Upper Right first molar has a large cavity on Distal surface and moderate cavity on Mesial surface.  Lower Right first molar #30 (in US) has recurrent cavity (cavity under filling) on Mesial surface or defective/fractured filling.  X-rays don't show 3 dimensions (tongue or cheek sides). maxim1477: Thank you for the detailed answer! It helps a lot. Regarding tooth #3 with the large cavity, do you think it has affected the nerve? What do you suggest doing to that tooth? honestdoc: If you have no pain and no swelling, try getting a filling.  Have your dentist place a bioactive pulpal protectant liner like Lime-Lite.  If you have intense pain that wakes you up that means your nerve (root canal) is damaged.  If you have swelling, that means your nerve died and became infected.  You would then need a root canal treatment and later a crown. Beware, most dentists are production hungry and would skip all that in favor of root canal and crown.  If you tell them you only want a filling, they would intentionally drill too deep.  It is very hard to find a dentist (like an auto mechanic,  contractor, etc) you can trust. maxim1477: Yes, I am quite weary of such types of dentists, which is why I've had to turn to this forum.Could it be that the nerve is damaged but no pain is felt? One doctor has suggested checking, but I'm concerned that this \"check\" will mean having to drill in order to determine whether the nerve is damaged. Is it in fact necessary to drill into the tooth to check if the nerve is damaged, or is there another way to determine this, for example by scanning? honestdoc: Cold test.  We use liquid nitrogen spray to a cotton ball.  If the tooth feels cold...great, the nerve is working.  If no cold is felt, then the nerve may be necrotic (dead).  If the dentist uses a Q-tip, false negative because it doesn't get cold enough.  If the tooth feels intense lingering pain, nerve is damaged.  On molars, it can get trickly because there are about 4 nerve canals and some canals maybe dead while others are good.  If so, the tooth will need a root canal as well.I feel the electric pulp tester is not as accurate especially if the tooth has a crown (cap).  I like the cold test better. maxim1477: Yesterday, I felt a sensation in the back tooth with the large cavity that you had seen earlier (molar, I believe, which was pictured above in my post on April 26th). To be precise, the feeling was in the gums. I felt it after I drank something cold (and the same when I eat certain things), and I felt the sensation continue until I used an antiseptic, at which point the sensation subsided significantly but not entirely. Does this indicate that the nerve is damaged?Also yesterday, I talked with my doctor about that back tooth and she suggested drilling into it to find out. Does this sound like an appropriate approach to you, given the trickiness of having 4 nerve canals in a molar? In other words, is it necessary to drill the tooth because of the difficulty of identifying damages to the nerves?Lastly, would be okay to ask where your practice is located? If not, no worries. Thanks again for your thoughts. Busybee: You should find a minimally invasive or conservative dentist for a second opinion.   These professionals are committed to ethical dentistry and preserving the health of the natural tooth as much as is practically possible whilst solving any dental health problems.  So if they do a filling they will remove only what is necessary. honestdoc: Did your dentist place a filling on the tooth with a large cavity?  The tooth feeling cold is a good thing.  It indicates the nerve is working.  Damaged nerve feels intense pain that can wake you a night and you can't chew on that side.  The dentist needs to drill on the tooth to fill the cavities.  There should be no extra drilling to identify anything. maxim1477: No, the large cavity wasn't filled. Thank you for describing this test on whether the nerve is damaged!The dentist I visited today said the following:The cavity has to be drilled into to see if the horns of the pulp (she calls \"horns\" the nerve's connective tissue/texture) are affected, because it could be affected, but I may not feel pain. The solution she proposed is to NOT remove the nerve but to try to cure it first, if the pulp is affected.\nThe sensation I am feeling (which I described previously) comes from the unevenness of the gums between the teeth (indicated in the photo). She called it periodontitis. She thinks it is the result of the cavity in the tooth. She was able to stimulate the sensation by using an instrument that blew air into the area.QUESTIONS:1. Do you agree with her conclusion and proposed approach about the horns of the pulp?2. Do you agree that the sensation is because of periodontitis? And how is the periodontitis related to the cavity? honestdoc: Where are you located?  You discussion with the dentist is odd.  I agree not to remove the nerve.  I recommend a pulpal protectant (bioactive dentinal liner) such as Lime-Lite near the pulp before a filling is placed.  This product helps the nerve heal.  Periodontitis is diagnosed after probing your gums for attachment loss.  If the probe reads 5 mm or deeper then you may have active disease.  GET THE TOOTH FILLED as soon as possible.  Afterwards, have your gums probed and determine if you have active disease.  If so, you may need deep cleaning. maxim1477: I am from Russia, and unfortunately, here the dentists tend to contradict each other. So the diagnoses and approaches are different. Do you have a general recommendation that I can follow? In particular, dentists want to remove the nerve, but I don't want to, so what should be the least invasive solution for my situation? I'm concerned that some of them don't know what Lime Lite is, so they choose instead to just remove the nerve. Is removing the nerve the only approach available if Lime Lite is not an option?Is it possible that an internal cavity (like I have) will be so complex to reach that it will be necessary to reach it through the neighboring tooth? Obviously, I wouldn't want anyone drilling two teeth to get to one cavity.Thank you for all your help. It's really difficult getting consistent consultation where I live. honestdoc: Do you live close to a big city?  I may be naive to Russia, but I assume the big city dentists may have more modern equipment/supplies.  The most conservative/least traumatic procedure is to do the filling.  I'm not sure Lime-Lite is readily available in Russia but an older alternative is Dycal (Calcium Hydroxide liner) to protect the nerve.  Have the filling done as soon as possible so it doesn't get bigger.  Even better is going to a teaching facility like a Dental School and have instructors overlooking or doing the procedure.  They may not be as aggressive to want to remove the nerve. maxim1477: Yes, I do live in a big city, but when you get different opinions, it makes you question the motives of the dentists.Do I understand correctly that Lime-lite is used only to protect the remaining uninfected pulp and nerves? In other words, the dentist will remove the infected parts of the pulp together with the infected nerves and apply Lime-lite to the remaining uninfected pulp and nerves. And afterward, the dentist will put a filling to seal up the tooth. This avoids a fill root canal as there remains good pulp and nerves in the tooth.This means Lime-lite doesn't cure the infected pulp and nerves, it only protects further spread of the infection and inflammation to the rest of the pulp and nerves.Is above understanding correct?I don't want to lose the nerves if it is not necessary, but I can't understand whether the problem is so serious that l should simply agree to lose all the nerves or continue looking for a dentist that performs such a procedure. What would you say in this case? Is it so serious that I should forget about saving the nerves with even if only some of them?I've spoken to at least 5 dentists since this problem began. Busybee: Are you in any position to perhaps hop on a plane to Hungary?  They have some of the best dentists in the World. honestdoc: When the cavity gets close to the nerve (pulp) of the tooth, I like to use Lime-Lite (by Pulpdent) which protects the nerve from injury and inflammation.  The nerve is very fragile and when you have a cavity close to the nerve, the nerve can get injured or die from the trauma of removing the cavity or contamination from the cavity.  The nerve must not get drilled into and keep intact.  If the nerve is exposed, you will need a root canal treatment removing the entire nerve down to the root tips. maxim1477: Thank you for your reply. Of course, my first choice is to go to Europe to attempt treatment, and to the list of Germany and France, I'll be considering Hungary also.Unfortunately, it's not so easy to get a visa to the EU. So, I am considering Israel. I've heard Israel has a lot of good dentists there, and I wouldn't need a visa. What do you think about treatment in Israel? maxim1477: honestdoc said:\t\t\tWhen the cavity gets close to the nerve (pulp) of the tooth, I like to use Lime-Lite (by Pulpdent) which protects the nerve from injury and inflammation.

    "title": "Dull toothache when biting down after one week of filling replacement",
    "dialogue": "Du_deleted: Hi,\nI had my filling replaced on last Monday. I feel sensitive and tingly feel on that tooth whenever I chew the food. After eating, it gives a dull ache on that tooth side and it goes off after a while. And when I keep closing my mouth in resting, it gives that dullache when upper and lower teeth touch. Is this normal after filling or should I go back to the dentist? \nAny input is really appreciated. Busybee: These things take time to settle.   Usually 3 months. MattKW: If not settling within 2 weeks, go back to dentist. Or if it worsens. White (composite) fillings are much more likely to give post-op pain than amalgams.

They said that, I might need a full crown coverage on that tooth. They just guessing that it will resolve the issue. They doubt that my tooth has been cracked underneath and they did fillings 2 times on that(replaced fillings last week). So, they say I need a full crown. I am totally shocked and worried now.

So, I don't know if I should go for crown as per his guess. \nI asked for a couple of days time and have to call them back. \nDo you think the crown will help this? Actually, I don't have any idea about crowns. Either me or my family doesn't have any before. So, no idea on that. Is it a good idea to go for crown now? Or my dentist is pushing me to some options? \nI can't trust him much as I don't have satisfaction in his work. He always guess and do the things and I have already taken 2 chances of fillings on that tooth. \nAny inputs or your opinion please? Busybee: Go to another dentist or two and get a second opinion.

MattKW: If this was a composite filling, then my first idea would be to redo with an amalgam, perhaps with a smear of a corticosteroid (\"Ledermix\"). So, my lining would be smear of Ledermix, then Dycal, amalgam. If your dentist is unwilling to do an amalgam, then ring around and go elswhere. Keep in touch. Any Xrays to show us, pls?

My dentist is not interested in amalgam and he want me to do a crown on that tooth. I have enquired with my friends and neighbors. Most of them say that their dentist do only composite fillings. I have to call up few more places and check. \nI have attached my x-ray in the another thread. I have a panaromic x-ray and few x-rays taken after the first filling.  I don't have any x-ray taken in these 2 weeks(after filling replacement)."

Diana honestdoc: In the US, that would be similar ~$190.00.  Most people here would use their 3rd party dental insurance to pay for it.  Unfortunately in the US, seeing the dentist for routine care can seem like a rip off.  For medical, I had to pay ~$900 for my daughter's ear wax removal (took 3 appointments and I have a high deductible only medical insurance).

You can charge what you like for any procedure and work accordingly. The most enjoyable procedures is a complex plan that takes a patient from despair to happiness."

Antibiotics will neither prevent nor cure a dry socket.\nIf you develop a dry socket, it will manifest 3-4 days post-op with enormous pain, bad breath, and foul taste.

From my limited view, I'm not seeing anything abnormal. hoss1985: I took a better picture. The left side of my tongue is kind of red. Peeling off, maybe? Thanks a lot for your time. honestdoc: Those bumps look normal.  Look up \"foliate papillae.\"  If you have pain, extreme redness, asymmetry, callous like lesions, have a dentist look at it. honestdoc: Also look up \"migratory glossitis.\" hoss1985: I will. Thanks a lot! It’s not symmetrical. The red spot is not painful. It’s not very much red. Looks slightly inflamed. I’m attaching another photo. Once again, thanks a lot. hoss1985: Also, the red spot hasn’t “migrated.” It’s been there for a few weeks. Is it something abnormal? Many thanks. honestdoc: I believe that is normal anatomy.  You could get another opinion.  Did you consume or rinse with anything that irritates like a new mouth rinse, cinnamon, new toothpaste, herbal substances, or similar?  If so, get it checked.  If the bumps happened for no apparent reason, continue to watch for symptoms I mentioned. hoss1985: I use cinnamon every now and then. But not that much. Also, I go back and forth between several toothpaste and mouthwash types. I was afraid it’s Erythroplakia. That got me scared a lot. honestdoc: You want to minimize/avoid chemical irritation in the mouth.  You mouth/body does not like irritation of any kind and may form abnormal tissue to protect from it.  Some toothpastes can irritate and I dislike mouth rinses especially if they are alcohol based.  For your peace of mind, have a dentist thoroughly examine the area and be sure to disclose all potentially irritating products you are using. hoss1985: Thanks a lot for the info! I've made an appointment with an ENT doctor for tomorrow. Will keep you posted. hoss1985: Hi. A quick update. My NET doc said it’s the geographic tongue and the bumps are taste buds.

    "dialogue": "Jenniferphillips: Hello, \nThree days ago, my two year old daughter fell and hit her face on a desk at a doctors office. :/ There was blood and tears and me freaking out. This was not the first time she had hurt this particular tooth. Around 10 months she flipped her tooth and they were able to put push it back and it healed beautifully and stayed white. During this particular incident at first the damaged tooth had a ever so slight very light grey color, barely noticeable. \nThis time is the same way only through X-ray she was found to have a horizontal fracture. The pediatric dentist recommended  antibiotics and to extract the tooth in a week. \nI received a second opinion, and that was to leave the tooth alone and evaluate since it wasn’t completely knocked out,  however it was a little dislodged and very quickly cleaned and out back in place. Treatment was fast! She is not experiencing any sensitivity to hot or cold. (She ate soft ice cream without a flinch) she does not seem to want to bite down on the tooth, but she knows she has a boo boo there and is favoring the side of her mouth (this only happened 72 hours ago) Her swelling has drastically gone down as well. It’s a little grayish between the gum and tooth but that’s where it was bleeding. \nMy question is what should I do? I obviously don’t want to extract the tooth and want to save it at all costs. I have two different opinions from two very respectful dentists. She doesn’t seem to be in anything more than a very mild discomfort. I was told that was could happen if it becomes infected, but as of right now, it’s not. I really want to wait and see or should I immediately extract? I have been cleaning the area with warm salt water, giving her a good diet, Tylenol for pain and did not give her the antibiotics. I didn’t give her the antibiotic because they said as of now there was no sign of infection. I know amoxicillin will fight the good and bad so I didn’t think there was really a point in giving it to her without infection present. Please advise!\nThank you for taking the time to read and respond to my post. honestdoc: I am not a pediatric dentist but work with a few of them.  I will be back at the office with them this Thursday and ask their opinion as well.  My opinion is to watch for swelling.  Amazingly, children are fast healers due to their efficient vascular system.  They have the potential to repair traumatized mouths naturally.  As long as they have no swelling or fever, continue to watch her and hopefully she will develop better coordination.  Her teeth may change color to maybe gray or darker.  Her teeth may exfoliate sooner or may need to be extracted before its time.  The key is swelling and or fever.  I'll ask one of the pediatric dentist of her opinion this Thursday.

    "title": "Am I Being Overtreated Question...?",
    "dialogue": "SandwichMonster: All,Thank you for taking the time to read this -- Essentially, I recently decided to use my dental insurance to look into my teeth (as I was experiencing throbbing jaw pain, possibly from grinding my teeth, as it runs in my family apparently). My question will delve into suspicion that I am being over-treated possibly for profit. I will provide some background information about me/my habits, as well as x-rays taken before I had work done, as well as what work was performed to the best of my memory, and then why I have these suspicions. If any experts could chime in, it would really help me with this quasi-investigation! I'm prior military, and had fillings performed during and before my time in service, some of these fillings having fallen/chipped out, or were replaced while I was in the Air Force (2006 to 2012). My dental hygiene wasn't great. I seldom flossed and brushed only once a day (I'm now flossing after dinner and brush twice a day with fluoride, I am 31 years old). I have only gone to the dentist before in 2017 where I needed a filling re-filled, and it was discovered I needed an additional filling in the neighboring tooth (My top right incisors, next to the front teeth (12 and 13, I believe). The dentist was affordable, suspected I may need a root canal in them but I told him to do his best with the filling. Since then, they've been fine (until this most recent dentist).I went to a dentist around January 2019 for the pain I mentioned earlier (the potential teeth grinding), where they took a full X-ray of my jaw (attached, hopefully below). They determined I needed approximately 12 fillings in my entire jaw. Four in my top front teeth (to include 12 and 13 as well as 22 and 23), four along my upper right molars, and then four more (I can't recall which part of my jaw, as I have not had them filled yet). They did inform me I'd need no root canals. Though the dentist did want me to undergo a full cleaning prior to the fillings (where they go under your gums, I think?). However, when I arrived for the cleaning the nurse/assistant(?) only felt I needed a simple cleaning and didn't need to go as deep.I had the front teeth filled, as well as the top right of my molars. They insisted on removing/re-filling 12 and 13, which I originally had filled by the dentist in 2017. I believed them and let them do it. Perhaps a month ago (two months after they filled 12 and 13), I awoke to throbbing pain around 12 and 13, which wasn't unbearable, but made it hard to sleep and concentrate. Concerned for my teeth, I scheduled an appointment that day and they concluded I needed a root canal in 12. I was fairly annoyed/upset, as the tooth was fine originally before they re-filled it, and now I was being told I'd need a root canal I'd have to pay for (the quote was around $500 after my insurance).It was around this time I read some articles about over-treatment, something I'd never considered a possibility before -- Doctors should be trusted. Sure, my dental hygiene wasn't good -- But to have upwards of 12 cavities which needed filling? And I must've mentioned I suspected I grind my teeth at least three times during varied appointments with this dentist/office, and they never once suggested a mouth guard or any real concern. None of my teeth currently hurt (the \"root canal\" pain went away after about two days, after the pain was isolated to 12 for one day and then felt completely fine by the third day). None of my teeth even really hurt when I first went to this dentist (aside from the suspected teeth grinding pain that was off and on randomly).So I requested my x-rays, to try and look at what they saw, and I cancelled my remaining appointments until I can figure this out. However, the x-rays they sent me honestly look like something out of some Top Secret document with lines being redacted. I reviewed some guides on how to view dental x-rays, but I'm hardly qualified.Can anyone advise on what they think is happening, am I being ripped off or is it all in my head? Thanks for your time! honestdoc: I do see cavities between your teeth.  How did you know to go to this new dentist?  I do agree that many dentists over treat teeth unnecessarily...how else will they produce income?  Unfortunately so are many other fields like auto mechanic, veterinarian, etc.  Find a dentist you trust, brush, floss (to reduce between the teeth cavities), and cut back on sugary beverages like soda, flavored coffee, and energy drinks. Busybee: Sandwich monster I would suggest you seek a second opinion on your current situation.  Unfortunately what your dentist did cannot be reversed but you can find out whether the work can be improved upon so that you are no longer in pain. It's impossible to say whether you have been over-treated but  it certainly sounds as though you had poor dental treatment whilst in the armed forces.   You are right to be cautious about undertaking any more extensive work.   You are where you are and the priority is to get you to a place where you feel comfortable again.Try to look for a \"minimally invasive\" or \"conservative\" dentist who should try to find a good solution for you with the least invasive treatment method.

I am not sure that good technicians are easily accessible to patients or that they would tell patients who they work for.  Certainly not sure if they would in the UK.  After all they don't know who you are or your motives.  But I do think that this information should be in the public domain to improve patient decision making.   Perhaps the way forward is transparency of dental pathways and subcontracting routes, so practices should be revealing their business partners.   I don't see why that would be contentious given they work on humans. NB CPD IMO is not relevant as it's a tick box for most professionals.  It does not test competence or outcomes. honestdoc: From my observations and experience, it can be very hard to find a dentist you can trust.  In the US, most people choose their dentist based on who their 3rd party dental insurance will cover.   I'm in a unique situation where I don't have to over treat to make a good living.  My modest student loans 21 years ago is paid off by the US government.  I work on state sponsored poor people and I make more than many private dentists who have to pay for their operating expenses.  Many of my contemporaries have student loans approaching or surpassing $400,000!  I don't know how to set up transparencies for the public.  However, in order to get credentialed for 3rd party dental insurance plans, dentists have to go through lengthy application and background processes."

    "dialogue": "GiddyG2001: Basically my dentist can't complete a root canal on my premolar because of its difficult roots. He's said he can refer me to the hospital for a specialist endodentist but they may not take the case. My son sees a private dentist and at his surgery,they have a endodentist and I know they take NHS patients on referrals. Can I ask for them to refer me to that surgery instead of the hospital?I'm on a tax credits exemption certificate in the UK so don't pay for my treatment. Currently awake with an abscess on the same tooth (I have antibiotics) and am very anxious about either getting the root canal or an extraction sorted soon as I'm aware abscesses can return if the procedure isn't done quickly after the infection clears. Busybee: I don't understand why your dentist started the root treatment instead of referring you in the first place.  You will have to pay for treatment if he refers you to the private sector.  Did you discuss an extraction with the dentist? GiddyG2001: I  don't know either! He did the first session,then said he wouldn't be able to get it done as my roots had \"vicious curves\" and I'd need to come back.\nWent back,took him 30mins to numb me,and even then,I wasn't completely numb so still couldn't finish.\nTold me to rebook a 3rd appointment on a certain day so a more experienced colleague was there to consult.\nI think what happened was,he's fairly young,he wanted to give it a go then realised he couldn't do it. So he should have admitted defeat. Which it seems he hasn't.\nHe did say extraction was an option if it failed (which it now has) but he also mentioned an endodentist at the hospital,which would be free on the NHS but would come with the caveat that I may not be accepted and would prob be on a long waiting list.\nI'm quite surprised I'd have to pay as my son's dentist say they accept NHS referrals. And my status on the NHS is free treatment. Busybee: You'd have to speak to your son's practice.   You should complain to the NHS about the treatment.   If the dentist cannot complete treatment then he should not have attempted it. MattKW: Busybee said:\t\t\tYou'd have to speak to your son's practice.   You should complain to the NHS about the treatment.   If the dentist cannot complete treatment then he should not have attempted it.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Unfortunately, it's not always possible to fully appreciate the difficulties of some treatment until you get into it.

The important thing is to recognise when you are out of your depth and pass it on, rather than keep trying and possibly do irrreversible damage.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...MattKW the most sensible dentists I have met do not even attempt a root treatment, even the simplest canal.  They always refer to a specialist.    it must be awful to have a treatment half done and have to eat and live with the pain and a weakened tooth while you wait to have it retreated. MattKW: I know a great many more dentists than you, and I tutor in the clinics at the Uni, so I know very well what is taught, and to what standard upon graduation, and what my many colleagues practise. You lack detailed knowledge of RCTs and the principles of pain control as properly applied in dentistry. \nAs a pertinent example, dentists are often presented with toothaches and to relieve the pain, they must extirpate the pulp. That is not \" awful\" or \"half done\"; that is standard first stage emergency pain relief for acute pulpitis and similarly for necrotic pulps. Done properly (and simply), there is prompt cessation of pain. If we didn't at least accomplish that step, then how would patients wait up to several weeks to get into a specialist (if that's who they need)? \nYounger dentists may defer their more complex RCTs to senior dentists in the practice, and senior dentists will sometimes refer to endodontists. RCTs are very much bread-and-butter for many general dentists - I finished 2 molars today. It sounds like you haven't always met the right ones. Busybee: We will have to agree to disagree on this.  In my opinion MattKW general dentists should never attempt root treatment and I would like to see this as a legal requirement.   Financial considerations should certainly not be part of any decision making in this respect.  We see plenty of examples just on this forum of the disaster that follows and patients who end up with long term pain and tooth loss.   It's best left to the specialists who have years of experience and the right equipment to save a tooth. MattKW: In your very limited opinion. Should we also leave surgical extractions to oral surgeons, and crown and bridge to prosthodontists? General dentists are trained in many procedures and should refer more difficult cases wisely. Busybee: General dentists should not be attempting root treatment and implants.     If they want to do either then they should complete the same training as a specialist and be required to have the same equipment.    Were this a legal requirement then there would be far more specialists than we have now. MattKW: General dentists are trained to do RCTs and are qualified to do so immediately upon graduation. They also receive rudimentary lessons in implants, and can do it after post-grad training. \nWhy on earth would you want more specialists? The cost of specialists is well out of the reach of most people, and should receive referrals when the treatment is too difficult for the general dentist. Why can you not understand this simple concept? (and you avoided answering about oral surgeons and prosthodontists).\nI infer that you work in some sort of health field, and I don't mind when you give general and supportive advice, but you really have no technical knowledge of dentistry, and some of your comments are dangerous and misleading.\nYou and your \"legal requirement\" nonsense, really. Do you not think that Dental Boards or Councils, specialist organisations, and Dental Associations are somehow less astute than you? Inneedofdentalhelp: I agree with Matt here, but what if they adopted a system more similar to medicine? One in which you specialise in some field upon graduation. That way there can be a number of specialists in each dental practice and the overall level of care would improve for all patients. Also dental associations/boards/councils are never infallible and there is always room for improvement. Busybee: Like I said MattKW we will have to agree to disagree on this one.  There are plenty of examples on this forum of inexperienced general dentists leaving people in enormous pain and distress by attempting complex root treatment.  The whole area of dentistry is insufficiently regulated.   Considering the damage that results from poor shoddy work it needs massive reform and a big rethink as to who can do what and who should not be allowed to do risky procedures.  To become a qualified doctor you are trained in all sorts of areas during a rotation but you do not have GPs attempting surgery even if they have done some training many years earlier.  General dentists should stick to the basics just as GPs do and leave invasive high risk procedures to specialists who do them all the time.    Passing patients around on a conveyor belt once it's too late is simply not acceptable. MattKW: Again, just what is your field of expertise? What recognised qualifications do you have?\nYou also don't seem to understand that fora like this attract problems, not successes, and are skewed representations of the population. MattKW: Inneedofdentalhelp said:\t\t\tI agree with Matt here, but what if they adopted a system more similar to medicine? One in which you specialise in some field upon graduation. That way there can be a number of specialists in each dental practice and the overall level of care would improve for all patients. Also dental associations/boards/councils are never infallible and there is always room for improvement.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Lovely idea, but the extra training (time and money) to be a specialist won't make it cheaper. And specialists don't want to work in the same practice as GDP and vice versa. I prefer to send patients to independent specialists of whom I approve - not all specialists are good. There are 3 local dental specialists to whom I refuse to send my patients (an orthodontist, endodontist, and paedodontist).\nBoards/councils aren't perfect, but Busybee hasn't proposed a better arrangement, just wishful thinking and no practical solution. Busybee: MattKW I am not sure how much you know about NHS Dentistry but it has never had a good reputation.  Most dentists here start their training in NHS practices straight out of university.   These dentists may have studied root treatment at dental school but they are insufficiently experienced and should not be in a position to start complex work where there is no clear referral path and where they have no specialist backup.    The NHS  needs to address this because people are ending up with serious health problems as a result of a lack of expertise.  There should be a specialist in every NHS practice but it's hard enough for them to try to find qualified dentists in the first place.   The majority of private practice general dentists here do not carry out root treatment themselves.  Even though they may be very experienced most refer that to a specialist.  That may be different in Australia but that's the case here.   You've said yourself that you do not trust some of your specialist colleagues to carry out work so how can patients have confidence in dental professionals?   Have you reported these specialists as incompetent?  There appears to be knowledge of incompetence amongst professionals but how many are outed to their boards? MattKW: Where do you get your information to make these assertions? You haven't answered any of my earlier questions, but just answer me this specific statement: \"The majority of private practice general dentists here do not carry out root treatment themselves.\" I simply don't accept that phrase unless you can provide a reference. e.g. how many RCTs does a general dentist perform, and what percentage does he/she send to an endodontist?\nSo much of your talk is unsubstantiated nonsense, and misleading to other people needing expert opinion on this forum. You speak from personal anecdotes at best. Busybee: MattKW my comments aren't anecdotal and you are taking this discussion too personally.  Everyone who lives in the UK is acutely aware of the failings of the dental system and particularly NHS dentistry for decades now.  There is a toxic environment and many dentists have retired with inexperienced new entrants or cynical sharks filling the gaps.  Private practices do not want litigation so they refer to specialists.  The NHS does not have the same easy referral routes.  In fact private practices are able to refer back to NHS specialists with \"too difficult\" cases.   The whole system needs reform here.   Yes there are good experienced dentists around but they do not put themselves at risk to perform anything complex.  They refer on because why would they expose themselves to potential litigation?   https://www.dentistry.co.uk/2015/09/04/i-am-a-dentist-get-me-outta-here/https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2018.359https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.1875-595X.1997.tb00793.x honestdoc: Busybee said:\t\t\tMattKW I am not sure how much you know about NHS Dentistry but it has never had a good reputation.

    "title": "Help Determine Cause of Tooth Wear",
    "dialogue": "spennny: Hi thereI have recently become aware that my teeth seem to display some evidence of wear. This can be seen on my two top front teeth, and my two bottom front teeth. I am trying to determine the cause of this problem. I have researched the possible causes of this type of wear and my understanding is that it is usually caused by: attrition, abrasion and/or erosion. Although it is possible that one of these is the cause of my problem, it certainly is not clear to me for the following reasons.Attrition:\nI do think it is likely that I clench my jaw at night and at times during the day, and subsequently grind my teeth to some extent, in particular my molars. However I do not understand how this could cause wear on my top and bottom front teeth. When I clench my jaw my front teeth go in front of my bottom teeth so they are not touching anything. I do not see what my front teeth could be grinding against. When I place my top front teeth directly on my bottom front teeth it feels incredibly unnatural and I am sure that I do not grind my teeth in that way. Abrasion:\nThere have been times in my life where I simply bought the cheapest toothbrush. This caused some gum line cavities. I have since corrected this problem and now use an electric toothbrush with extra soft bristles. Although this time using a hard bristled toothbrush could have contributed to the wear on the tops of my front teeth, I don't think it could have caused this amount of wear because I don't spend much time brushing the tops of my front teeth. At times I do use my teeth to help open something but it's extremely rare and hardly worth mentioning. I also used to bite my nails as a child but not since then.Erosion:\nThis cause is very unlikely in my mind as I do not drink pop, fruit juices or much of anything acidic. \nAny help in understanding the cause of this problem would be greatly appreciated. In particular if this could be caused by bruxism and if so how? I have attached some pictures. I am happy to answer any questions if more information is needed.Some other notes: \nI have tooth sensitivity on one of my bottom front teeth\nI am a 40 year old male\nI have never had my wisdom teeth taken out\nI obviously have some crowding issues\nI use sensodyne\nI brush and floss once a day before bed Busybee: It's normal to have some wear at age 40.  The likely reason for your wear is your tooth alignment and your jaw habits (so attrition), but there's no point changing your tooth alignment at your age.  Your best preventative measure is to get a night guard for when you are asleep and can't control your jaw, and to try to relax your jaw in the day when you are awake and able to control things.   Your dentist can make you a night guard.   You have to consciously change your daytime habits.   A dentist can repair the damage but all dental work has costs and benefits and it's best you try the conservative route before any artificial solutions."

    "dialogue": "Jack23: Hi,\nI just had few dental x-rays today and I am freaking out now.\nI went to my dentist office last Wednesday for some issues and he did take an x-ray on that particular area. So it's just an x-ray for the lower left side.I went back today for some urgent dental issue and the dentist took another x-ray today also. It's also on the same lower left side. Same as last week . The x-ray for 2 teeth. Within a week, I had taken 2 x-rays of same kind.\nToday, he also wanted me to take a paranomic x-ray and I did take that to rule out if there is anything causing the issue. This is the first time I am taking the paranomic x-ray and haven't done that before. The staff asked me to remove my earrings and told me to put my face in there.My concern is,\n1. She didn't give me any apron for the paranomic x-ray and I also forgot to ask her. Just realised after coming back.\nIs she forgot to give apron? Anyway, the body would have got some radiations right? I so scared if it cause any harm?\nI am not pregnant. But she did give me apron for the small x-ray which she has taken when I was in the dental chair. The paranomic machine was in another room and she took me there and didn't give me any apron. The dentist office is closed now and I cannot call her and ask white she didn't give me apron. Also, I tried to close my eyes during the panaromic x-ray and may be I opened after few seconds. Does it do any harm to the eyes if open?\nAnd without apron does it harm to the body and any harm to the Head/brain?2. Whether too much dental x-rays within a short time is good for health? Does it harm?\nI know these questions will be silly to some of you. But as a dental nervous patient and very naive on the dental stuff, these are running on my mind.\nPlease help if you have any inputs on this. Busybee: In the UK they only give you an apron if you are a child or pregnant.   The levels of radiation used in dental x rays are very low.  You are exposed to similar levels of natural radiation or if you take a plane journey.    That said they do avoid unnecessary x rays these days."

Here is the link.https://www.dentistry-forums.com/th...ng-which-side-of-the-tooth.24778/#post-123259I went back to my dentist last week to check if I really need to redo the fillings. He did an x-ray and said those fillings are very very shallow and doesn't even look like I have fillings on that tooth in the x-ray. He checked for bite and adjusted my bite on lower tooth where the fillings are done and also adjacent lower tooth too. And told me to tell watch for 2 weeks. I was fine the next day and sometimes I got the sharp pain while biting/chewing(sometimes on upper side and sometimes on lower side too)and  left jaw under the ears started hurting. It feels sore when I touch under my ears and looks like little swollen lump. I just don't want to go back to the dentist and thought of wait and watch. I had the same discomfort or the soreness in the left jaw side and under the ears for past 5 days. Today morning I see a small lump which looks like swollen under my tooth root.its near the tooth number 18 and 19. Not sure which tooth exactly. It feel sore to touch and looks like hard lump. Near the bottom cheek area.  \nI touched both the tooth by giving some pressure and there is no pain. I feel the sore lump feeling like swollen. It's under those tooth and also near the jaw under the ears. It feels so sore. Whenever I eat food, it feels so sore and very sensitive to the first bite though. I get the sharp pain on the left jaw side for the first bite and it goes off.What should I do? I am so freaking out now. Should I go back to the dentist?

There is a small swelling on the tooth root and sharp pain near jaws and under the ears. Jack23: Just an update \nI got call from my dentist office today morning and they asked me to come for a filling redo next week. I told them that I have something like hard lump on the skin outerside and I would like to check it out. I was already in the Urgent care when they called me up.\nSince I have sharp pain under ears and jawline, I went to the urgent Care to rule out any ear infection and Dr said everything fine and she said lump looks hard and it might be an access and asked me to check with dentist. Went back to dentist office today and told about the hard lump. They did take another x-ray and said there is no infection around there. The dentist also said that I may try redoing the filling as that may be the reason for the issues on the left side jaw. Redoing the filling scheduled after 2 weeks. \nHe also checked my bite today and did some bite adjustments. Last Wednesday I went for a dental visit for the issue in the left side of the mouth around the filling areas and he did take an x-ray and did some bite adjustments.I am so so worried now if too much bite adjustments are really good enough and solve the issue?Also, it was another dentist today in the office(not the same dentist who did my fillings and all those previous bite adjustments). He said he wanna do a paranomic dental x-ray. So, I also had taken that today. He said that panaromic x-ray looks fine and normal.I came home and feel the tooth is so sharp when I run through the tongue. Is that normal? Will it go off on its own after few brushing?

Dry sockets in upper teeth are rare.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nI hope I am just being overly worried but this huge hole has filled in very rapidly (24 hours) with a really red and soft tissue, it also feels like its bulging and overgrowing the size of the gum. I have attached another picture. Do you think this is still healing normally or shall I book myself a dental appointment? Inneedofdentalhelp: I’ll also add there is absolutely no gum covering this tissue either, it is hard to find pictures of what healing should look like but I have not found any pictures that look like this. In most i’ve seen its almost as if the edges of the existing gum get closer and closer closing the hole. Instead, I have this huge growth that seemingly appeared from no where. Also, it’s been 8 days and I still have the same level of pain as day 1. Inneedofdentalhelp: It is hard to capture this in 3D but it is overgrowing the size of the gum quite significantly, feels really tender and soft (I try my absolute best not to touch it with my tongue) and that side of my face is generally quite sensitive. It is growing, and has been since that last photo. drlolk: relax its take anywhere from a week to 2 weeks for the extraction site to recuperate, the actual healing part that includes bone takes about a year. This is the normal blood cot that forms. so you are in the clear for dry socket. try to ice it and sleep upright also try not to bend or do any strenuous workouts. I find that it is best to tell patients to do slat water gargles with room tempo water.  Happy healing and hope you feel better"

Long story short, he makes my temporary and I see that the bottom of the bridge isn't seated all the way down on my gums and there is actually quite a bite of space underneath. I asked him why it looked like this and he basically said for cleaning purposes. I have family and friends that have dental bridges and NONE of theirs look like mine. He said he told his dental lab to not bring the bridge all the way down and to leave \"3-4mm of space for cleaning\". Does anyone know what kind of bridge this is? And is this legit? It's not aesthetically pleasing whatsoever and I've tried to ask him to please not do this but he insists that I need this. My gums are a bit \"droopy\". Not sure how to describe it other than it kind of sags a bit but I still don't see why the bridge has to be open. Again, I've looked online but can't find anything on it which makes me feel worse about it.\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks Busybee: Sounds like a great trap for food waste and bacteria.

Pieces of food have been getting stuck underneath the bridge, fortunately I have a Waterpik to get it all out. \nThe entire situation is very discouraging. Busybee: it does not sound right at all.  Is the bridge now permanently fixed or did they put it in with temporary cement so you could try it? Cece Rocha: Currently have on temps. I have an appointment today for a fit in (dentist said they will have one of the employees from the lab come and bring the bridge for me to try on so I guess that's where I will be able to see what it looks like). I will take a picture and upload it so you can see. Cece Rocha: This is the bridge. I think it looks awful. I asked them to take it back and fix the space between the teeth because it looks so fake. My husband also thinks it looks really noticeable. If you look at the bottom you can see what I mean with the bridge not touching my gums. When they put it in the try it felt okay but I just can't get past the look. I'm so disappointed and actually dreading the final cementing part. Busybee: It looks pretty poor workmanship. MattKW: Temporary bridges can be a bit rough. The porcelain will be much smoother - you should consider a try-in without anaesthetic. I try to do fittings of crowns or bridges without LA so patients can feel better, especially the bite.\nThere are competing schools of thought sometimes when it comes to whether to contact the gums or not. You would have quite a lot of porcelain to touch the gums in your case, and cleaning could be difficult. Primarily, the patient needs to be able to maintain the supporting teeth with good hygiene. So some bridges are designed to be easily cleansed. Of course other factors come into it too. For example, do you show the gap when talking normally? If you're not sure, maybe ask for a temporary bridge down to the gums to try before committing yourself to the current bridge."

The dentist was saying he had the beginnings of periodontal disease and would need a $300 deep cleaning and they could fit him that day but his rance did not cover it. He told them that he could not afford that right now and asked for just a basic cleaning and was told that they legally could not do that. I've also been reading forums and have heard this complaint several times about it being illegal.I'm in Florida is this the same in other states.  What is the law they are talking about? or how would i find it if it is a law? honestdoc: From my state, the dental board will drop the hammer on the provider stating \"unacceptable treatment based on diagnosis\" and the provider will have the board disciplinary action for all to see.  That is why dentists & hygienist refuse to just do a simple cleaning. MattKW: I think that would be unreasonable. We all have patients who can't afford or want certain treatment that we deem necessary. As long as it's explained and recorded, and I am at least doing no harm, then there is no compulsion on me to refuse treatment in such a case. But i must not do that treatment to an unsatisfactory degree. So, if you want a simple scaling, but I tell you you need a root planing etc, then I'll do a scaling for you. Better than doing nothing. If the dentist feels uncomfortable however, he can refuse to do treatment too. It's a two-way street of consent and understanding. honestdoc: I agree with Dr. MattKW that when patients cannot afford full treatment, we can reasonably accommodate them.  Here in the US, where if you spill hot coffee on yourself and the cup didn't warn you \"contents are hot,\" you can sue McDonalds or Starbucks, etc. The legal system is flooded with hungry lawyers.  A particular case involved a non-compliant periodontal (severe gum disease) patient who refused advice, treatment, referrals, and appointments later sued the dentist and won for teeth loss.  The jury found for the patient because the \"dentist did not adequately prove to the patient his deteriorating gum disease.\"The licensing board in my state is very strict on appropriate \"acceptable treatment\" which can be vague. We will have a large group conference with a board investigator in a few months and it will be interesting what his views on that would be.  I anticipate it to be reasonable like Dr. MattKW mentioned."

    "dialogue": "GiddyG2001: Went for my first root canal treatment a week ago,they did half and said they'd complete it next week as I have a \"wicker curve\" in my root.\nWent back today,took 5 hits of anaesthetic and could still feel them prodding. But wanted to get it done so told them to continue. They still couldn't finish today as they spent 30 mins trying to numb me up.\nThat was at 9 this morning,anaesthetic has worn off and I'm left with a sinking feeling I've developed/got an abscess in that tooth. Its throbbing and sore when I press down.\nAfter the first treatment,my whole mouth was sore for a few days,but this is a different pain and isolated to the the tooth.Is it possible to develop an abscess that quick? I'm panicking quite a bit as I suffered with abscesses a few times in the past and honestly,the pain was that bad,I'd rather go through child birth again! I'm hoping against everything my tooth is just sore from all the prodding around but it feels exactly like it did all those years ago.I have a fear of the dentists anyway so this is not helping.Any advice? GiddyG2001: Anyone? honestdoc: Ask to be referred to an endodontist (root canal specialist).  He/she may be more expensive but that is all they do and will have all the latest and greatest equipment.  If costs, time, convenience etc are prohibitive, consider extraction."

I had few more fillings along with this on the upper side.\nI had some pain and discomfort and I went in for a bite adjustment. The sharp pain while chewing went off. But there is a pressure like feeling on the tooth#19 and pain in the left end jaw starts after the day of the fillings. It keeps on hurting on the left side jaw. I am not sure which tooth causing this issue as I did fillings on the lower and upper left. \nI called up my dentist and he said I need to redo the filling in the lower left as it cause the pain on the left lower jaw. And said that it's not bonded properly. They could be reason. But didn't confirm it though. I had white resin filling.\nI had the filling on tooth number 19 mentioned as posterior one surface O.

    "dialogue": "TOM42: Curiosity question. My 4yr old, 7months, just lost her first tooth, top center left, rather quickly. Took about 3 days to go from solid to out... which seemed fast. She mentioned her bottom tooth, 2 off the center line was sore last night. Upon closer inspection this morning I noticed a VERY small white \"tooth\" that was loose in between her front left baby teeth. It's exactly where you would find your gums extended between the teeth, about the size of a pencil lead. It's very loose, and appears to be almost like a micro tooth pushing up between her baby teeth, not in front or behind. Imagine the broken tip of a pencil max, it's about that size, seated in her gums between her 2nd and 3rd lower front teeth. If she would let me touch it, I bet it would come out. The 2 surrounding teeth are still firmly seated. If she continues to express discomfort I will take her to the dentist immediately but I was just wondering if anyone has seen anything like this before. Just seems odd... any information is appreciated. Thanks~ honestdoc: Could you provide an image?"

If you can't get the prescription, use topical numbing gels and the lesion should go away after 7 to 10 days. honestdoc: Correction \"canker sore\"  sorry for the scare."

    "dialogue": "Charlene352019: Hi I have a front crown due to a injury when I was a teenager. This crown as now moved and has a grey gum line . Because I grind my teeth in my sleep  it has chipped my front two top teeth .  My regular dentist wouldn't do anything as he says they are healthy and because i grind my teeth he wouldnt feel comfortable doing it. Does anyone have any advice please .  They don't look healthy and  I feel I don't want to eat as it might make it worse and they feel weak.   I use a nightguard at night so I dont actually feel like I do grind my teeth now I think im clenching my teeth now in my sleep which I can't help doing which is now making me not want to sleep.  If i went to a private dentist do you think they would replace my crown and put crowns on the chipped ones .  Also does anyone know the costs of crowns privately. I would have to look at finance as I can't afford them really but it's really affecting me I don't want to talk to people as I feel that's all they see and judging me . Busybee: There's no reason why they would not replace a crown with a grey margin.  They might not want to crown the others though.   It does not sound as though you have a good night guard.  Is it hard or soft?   In terms of cost it depends where you are based.   In the UK you should be able to get a good crown from £200 to £900.   But for a front tooth it's worth paying more at a place where they use good technicians and getting it right (colour, fit etc).   There is always a risk of a root canal if you change a crown.  You should get your gums checked if you have recession.  Again recession can be caused by grinding.  It's worth investing in something like this at a reputable place, because you can end up spending three times as much by going to a cheap smile clinic type place.Just wanted to add that I think you will come up against the same issue as your dentist has mentioned - because you grind there may be reluctance to make any changes.    So what you might find is that you are given a night guard and kept waiting until your bite miraculously stops grinding (which it never really does if you're a grinder).  Catch 22.   Many dentists are worried about touching this type of problem for that reason.  They worry anything done will make it worse.  It' may be best to just say you are not happy with the appearance of that tooth and then deal with the grinding issue afterwards.  It's not like it will go away easily whether you change the crown or not.   It's a risky business and you may find that you are happier now than after any changes.  Particularly if they lead to a root canal or if you're still not happy with your appearance.   Dentists rarely improve on nature and there is a very wide variety of quality out there in terms of function, aesthetics, craftsmanship.    Have a few consultations and don't sign up to anything without a good deal of thought.   In particular be wary of anyone suggesting you have other teeth touched.   Once you start that's it."

    "title": "Upper wisdom tooth causing Eustachian tube dysfunction and sinus issues on the right ( x-ray )",
    "dialogue": "ionicle: Alright, gals and guys, here's my issue:About 4 months ago, I woke up one morning with a right ear that felt strangely congested. Slight congestion, that I first wrote off as earwax that needed to be removed at a doctor's office. Didn't think too much of it for about a week, then I finally got the ear irrigated, however, the slight congestion still persisted even though the ear canal was completely clean. By that time I had already started suspecting I got a mild form of Eustachian tube dysfunction - the tube, connecting the middle ear with the throat was partially plugged up with mucus and was unable to drain properly. I had not suffered any colds or viral illnesses prior to the day I started feeling this congestion though.The issue persists up to this day, and is only happening on the right side. When I move my jaw around in a certain way, I can hear crackling and popping inside the ear, as if something sticky is moving around. It's not getting worse, but not getting better either, and for the past 10 or so days I've been having pretty intense postnasal drip on the right side of the back of my throat, with somewhat thick mucus that is slightly salty in taste. Whenever I move my jaw around in order to try and open the Eustachian tube for better drainage, my right maxillary sinus clogs up almost immediately, which makes me believe the sinus itself is somehow affected and when swelling up, it also impairs the drainage of the Eustachian tube. Whenever I swallow forcefully ( this activates the opening of the Eustachian tube ), I can sense thick mucus at the back of my throat and I feel something moving a few centimetres below the ear ( should be my right Eustachian tube ). Can't really say if it's moving up or down, but down would be my guess, since then I can feel that mucus in my throat.I feel marginally better when walking around and doing any sort of physical activity - sinuses are opened up, and postnasal drip rate is very slim.Here comes the dental part:Since this whole issue is unilateral ( one-sided ), is it possible that it's caused by my right upper wisdom tooth? Haven't had that pulled out yet, but is it possible that it's somehow irritating the sinus cavity above the tooth, causing chronic inflammation, which in turn presses on the Eustachian tube, impairing its function? The tooth itself doesn't hurt at all, hasn't hurt before, and the sinus itself or the ear and tube affected are not painful either. The tooth feels slightly painful when I press on it with my finger, but the pain is not severe at all. Is it possible that that tooth is somehow traumatizing the area directly above its roots ( which seems to coincide with the area I am feeling the tube discomfort in )?I had a panoramic x-ray done of that side of my jaw. Here's the image:https://pasteboard.co/I6004hz.jpgCan someone with sufficient knowledge in reading dental x-rays take a look, and tell me if there's any indication of something in the upper right jaw segment messing with my sinus? I am particularly interested in that long black canal that starts right above the root of the upper wisdom tooth. A fellow dentist told me that's just an artifact, and nothing to worry about. Is that so?"

But I see the dentist name in the AGD website and I see the award as Pre-fellow. Do we need to choose only the FAGD or MAGD dentist and not Pre-fellow? honestdoc: Pre-fellow means the dentist has not completed fellowship requirements.

    "dialogue": "Du_deleted: Hi,I had 4 tooth cavity fillings in the month of June 2018. The numbers are 13,14,15,19.I had severe sharp pain after the fillings done and I went to my dentist and he filed down the high fillings. I went for four visits as I always feel some discomfort or some pressure in the left lower side of my mouth. He filed down the extra in my 3 visits and in the 4th visit, he said there might be bubbles inside the filling and the filling has to be replaced. I am always do nervous about dental visit and this was my first cavity filling done in my life. So, I was worried about doing it again. He told that it has to be redone to the tooth number 19.He didn't take any x-rays. I am so worried and didn't go back to the dentist. I still get the pain or pressure feeling in my lower left side of the mouth. I am not sure if it's because of the air bubbles in the tooth number 19 or the fillings done in the upper left side tooth too. I am not sure which one is causing problem. How to identify the air bubbles in the cavity filling? What should do I do now?kindly please help me with your advice. It really makes me nervous. Thank you! honestdoc: Most likely your dentist placed tooth colored composite fillings.  Unfortunately all modern composites shrink about 1% during light cure.  With the shrinkage, there could be gaps, voids, or sometimes air bubbles.  There is a new bioactive filling material called Activa which won't shrink and bonds naturally to teeth.  Ask your dentist about that product.  It is more expensive because it is relatively new to the market.

The filling will be white (more dense).  A gap or an air bubble with be dark (less dense).  Many times you may see a dark line around the white composite due to its light curing shrinkage.  You may post it for us to look at it. MattKW: The other possibility is to replace with amalgam. There is no shrinkage, and post-op sensitivity is rare.

My first dentist said he will do the refilling for free as the first work was not properly done. I know there will be out of pocket even for the consultation with second dentist.\nBut I am not so happy with my first dentist work and i want to make sure what's the exact issue. That's the reason, I am looking for second opinion. If the second dentist say that the refilling has to be done and can I go to the first dentist to redo the filling? In that case, I can save my dollars and I can be sure of what's the exact issue.Also, I got a chance to send my x-rays to my family doctor back in my home country. He said, I don't need fillings for these small cavities and he mentioned that 2 cavities were small and you would have avoided that. So, I am just confused why my new dentist in the US told me to do all the 4 fillings. I didn't look for any second opinion and filled it up. So, I am just wanna make sure with another dentist. honestdoc: I'm sorry to say, many dentist in the US can be money hungry.  You can try the 2nd dentist.  Hopefully it will work in your favor.

VishwasG: I have already shown the dentist. But she seems like can't find anything.  She says, it must be related to gums, because if root canal has been done, that means the tooth is dead and you should not feel any pain because of tooth or dentine. I am doubtful about it though. Because even if tooth is dead, it's roots are connected with gums. Busybee: I think it's like I said.   A bad crown margin will irritate the gum whether or not the tooth is root filled.    Exposed dentine can also let bacteria get into the root area and cause symptoms.  Nothing will show up on x rays but you end up with irritating symptoms.  Changing the crown could help but only if you go to a dentist who understands the need to have good margins."

These cavities have not penetrated through the enamel layer and can be remineralized (healed).  Use Over the Counter Fluoride rinses and floss between your teeth every night.  I don't see any need for fillings at this time.  You may see a different dentist if you don't feel comfortable with your present one.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Thank you so much for your reply @honestdoc . He also mentioned number 19. He said number 19 has lot of cavity and told me to get it done and don't wait till it gets to root canal.\nHe mentioned the numbers as 5,13,14,15,16,19. Does 19 have cavity? honestdoc: #19 has no cavities on the sides, maybe small ones on front (cheek) or back (tongue) sides.  This dentist must be hungry.  Find another dentist.  You don't need any fillings.  Use Fluoride rinse to help remineralized all of the small cavities still outside the enamel layer.  I have 3 cavities so much bigger and have been watching them for 30 years. You do need 2 upper wisdom teeth extracted.  They should be minimal trauma.

Oral surgeon removes wisdom teeth but many insurance companies may require referrals from general dentists to be covered.  The wisdom teeth you have should be easy to remove.  It is hyper-erupted (lower than other teeth) which will have less bone attachment and unopposed (no lower teeth to apply resistance) so the bone would be less dense.   Only request the 2 wisdom teeth to be removed or find another dentist. Jack23: honestdoc said:\t\t\tOrthodontist only does braces and straightening teeth.

I was having the pain or pressure like feeling in my lower left teeth since I had these fillings. I went to my dentist 4 times and he did some bite adjustments 3 times and in the 4th visit, he said that I have to refill the filling since it's giving me some issues and am coming for 4th time. I went for the 4th visit in the month of September. He said it could be air bubbles. He said he will do the refilling for free because it's just air bubbles issue. I still have the pressure like feeling in my left side and I want to get rid of it as it affects me everyday and my day to day life.  I am thinking if I should go for second opinion to check this issue and to check the bites. My upper and lower teeth not aligning properly. I wanted to check if I really should do the refilling. If I go to a second dentist, he will take x-ray and examine. If he says that I have to redo the filling, can I go back to my first dentist for filling? Because he said he will do that for free. \nWhether he identify or able to catch up my record that i went to another dentist for second opinion. Is that possible in US?\nWhy I am asking this question is, i have changed my  insurance plan this year and I have to do out of my pocket.So, if he does the refilling for free, it will be good for me.\nAny inputs on this ?

    "title": "Implant question",
    "dialogue": "Bazgriffo1967: Hi all.. Yesterday I had drilling and three dental implants inserted, i was told it went well.. I have a concern though, because with two of the three implants the surgeon used what I can only describe as a ratchet to screw down the implant nice and tight, but with the third he jeasily just screwed it in with his fingers, wasn't a tight fit at all, is this okay no ratchet required?\nThanks for any possible help. Oceansightdental: Lol, wow you pay close attention. There's two major reasons we put an implant in with our fingers insteda of using a ratchet: Bone is too stiff or bone is too weak. If your bone was too stiff then  this is not an issue whatsoever. If on the other hand your bone was too weak, then you need to be careful not to apply any pressure to the implants. Occasionally, when we're placing a dental implant near the sinuses (upper back region), we use hand torque to ensure that the implant doesn't fall into the sinus. My recommendation is to not stress and let your dentist handle this one. It sounds like he or she knows what to do. \nAli Jazayeri DDS Bazgriffo1967: Thank you for your kind reply Dr Jazayeri..\nAll three of my implants are lower jaw molars..\nI've had a thought though... the one implant that was screwed in by hand only, happens to be right nextdoor to one that a ratchet was used for, is that common practice? My thinking is, you can't torque off two implants that sit only mm's apart from one another, in case of fracture maybe?\nIm probably way off the mark but thought it might be worth mentioning.\nKind regards,\nBarrie Oceansightdental: Well the fact that the implants are in the lower jaw is great since the mandible has much higher bone quality for implant placement. The torquing has nothing to do with implant proximity. There's two scenarios here: (a) your bone was so stiff that your dentist was comfortable hand torquing it in place. (b) You recently had a tooth pulled in the region and the area still had softer bone. In these cases, we can't get enough stability on the implant so we just throw it in there and hope for the best. Hope this helps. If you attach an X-ray I can tell you exactly what is going on."

In theory, if you are not having a crown, then they could bill you the composite fee but not core bu.  Core bu is when you will have a crown.  The dentist appears production hungry.  Do you have dental insurance? Wesleyd123: Yes I have dental insurance. Met-life $2500 a year. My insurance brings the bill down to $552.60. However that eats all my dental for the year and I definitely need more work. However judging by your answer the bill seems somewhat reasonable? Maybe a bit over priced but not something crazy? honestdoc: I think if the dentist is going to put a crown on your tooth and charging core bu procedure code, that dentist shouldn't charge you for composite 2 surf procedure.  Ask your dentist to not charge you for it."

And, with having autoimmune diseases (One being sjogrens, thus taking saliva from my mouth, creating a terrible DRY mouth, & a breeding ground for cavities).....I am just already sick of this. This is the start of my second week. Right off, I got a huge cut, type bleeding blister, JUST from putting the partial in 4 times to make sure I could put the dental partial in and out with ease. Oh and I am faithful in my bioteen product use for adding moisture to my mouth. I use magic mouthwash prescription to aid in healing cancers etc.So, I kept it out, allowing some healing and after a week, I tried to wear it. I had it in, 3 hours, and WOW little did I know, I had a huge blood blister/cut bleeding in the same spot, but I have bleeding behind the first tooth the partial clips on to. Still slight bleeding, and the tooth now hurts And a tooth near where the second part of the partial wraps on to? Toothache! I had a terrible, terrible canker inside my left cheek. My jaw is off some too in lining up when I bite, due to my jaw being dislocated years ago. I wonder if this is just putting off me needing to eventually go to dentures. We have worked so hard trying to save my teeth .My bottom 3? I swear they had more fillings, would break, and then event the roots decayed. All that for nothing I guess.I want to add, I really love my dentist. I go to my local hospital's dental clinic, as Medicare does not offer dental insurance & no way could I begin to face dental billsAll ideas, thoughts & comments welcomed. Having Lupus also can make an ordinary day discouraging. \nThanks for taking time to read. honestdoc: Hopefully you can have your autoimmune condition managed as best as possible.  I would try to keep your partial denture as long as possible because you lose more function with full dentures.  Have your dentist adjust your partial dentures so they won't hurt.  Even show up in the morning and \"test drive\" the adjusted partial throughout the day especially during lunch and possibly have it readjusted before closing time.  Wearing the partial may feel awkward but never painful. Deborah Murphy: Thank you very much. I see the dentist Friday, and I will have my list of questions, and I will post a follow up to this. I am disappointed, but hoping for a solution. Fingers crossed."

    "title": "Tooth Pain, Cavities, X-rays - Need Advice Please",
    "dialogue": "EmBee: Hello!  (Please see x-rays below, in the next message)Recap - I have been having pain in my teeth, particularly my second to last tooth on my lower right. Also have some pain in my top teeth, close to the gums, on the same right side. I have had pain in my teeth for a few months now. Dentist thinks it's all from grinding my teeth. I have been wearing a mouth guard at night for months (since the pain started) but the pain is still there, particularly on the bottom tooth (second to the last, on the right). The pain sometimes wakes me up at night. It is not excruciating pain, but it is quite painful and it is there in the background 90% of the time. Hurts spontaneously. Hurts a lot after I eat.  I should probably mention that I also had pain in my head before, i.e. when this all started a few months ago... but once I started wearing my mouth guard the pain in my head reduced significantly. Now it's mostly just the tooth/mouth pain that I'm dealing with. The tooth pain also radiates to my ear, sometimes also to my temple. And it sometimes wakes me up at night.I saw another dentist today and took a set of full mouth x-rays. He said he could see nothing that would be causing all this pain other than grinding. Says I have a couple of \"tiny cavities\" on top of the lower teeth (last and second to the last), but he said even if I get those cavities filled, I will still experience this pain, since those small cavities are not big enough to be causing this kind of pain. He thinks I should just keep wearing the mouth guard and swish around with fluoride rinse a couple of times a day to help the teeth settle down.I am not sure if I should fill the small cavities on the troublesome tooth (and the one right next to it) now or not. If my mouth is in this much pain supposedly just from grinding, I am wondering if I should just wait for everything to hopefully settle down before doing anything else? So, I am leaning towards not filling the cavities yet since I don't want my teeth to go through more trauma and become an even bigger issue. On the other hand, the pain is very concerning, very distracting... and I am concerned that perhaps what looks like small cavities might be something much bigger that's just not showing up on the x-ray? When I take ibuprofen, the pain subsides... but I am concerned about taking ibuprofen almost daily for such a long time.What else can I do? I had considered a CBCT scan to look for hidden infections, but decided against it after getting advice here, and I opted for regular x-rays of my entire mouth instead.Could all this horrible pain really just be from grinding, or could there be more to it than this? Is there any other way to rule anything more serious out? If you have any advice for me, I would really appreciate it!Please see x-rays attached in the next message.Thank you very much!! EmBee:  honestdoc: Don't fill the small cavities.  They haven't penetrated through the enamel and can be reversed.  I'm going to agree with the 2 dentists that the pain may be related to your grinding and or clenching.  When your jaws are at rest, the teeth should be about 1/4 inch or 1/2 cm apart.

    "dialogue": "Manda: Hi, I recently had 2 fillings at the front of my mouth, with a dentist I had not been to before. While my teeth are by no means perfect, I felt that the colour of the new fillings looked greyish yellow on them. Also, they were not polished smooth at the time, and feel rough against my tongue. They have stained very quickly. \nShould I complain? Busybee: Yes you should because a dentist can choose to make them a lighter colour.   Modern composite should not stain so easily.    As a patient you put your faith in your dentist to make any work they do in your mouth look as natural as possible.  There are different types of composite and different dentists are more or less skilled at using the material.  Functionality doesn't always mean the aesthetics are pleasing unless the dentist has thought both through carefully and also has skills in more than just functionality. The roughness should wear off over time.  . MattKW: Many modern composites are very translucent, which can give a greyer look if you have normally dense teeth. Whilst you can buy composites in differing opacities (e.g. dentine, enamel, incisal), I always buy the opaque dentine shades because they work for more people. And I keep some extremely opaque liquid composites (flowables) for particularly difficult teeth. Go back and ask the dentist politely to see if he thinks he can redo better; and you need to have them polished because they won't smooth themselves off."

This means that you should be entitled to a free new crown if the work was recently done. As far as predicting whether or not a root canal was needed in advance, that is difficult to judge. Some teeth don't show any pain symptoms until a crown is placed on them. It could have been that the dentist shaved too much of the tooth, but there's no way of proving it one way or another.

Many dentists think this should be a hard guard, but I think a soft one is best if you are just wearing teeth.  I say this because I once cracked a tooth with a hard guard (which resulted in an onlay).  It's also really difficult for dentists to make a hard guard comfortable.   I'm not a dentist and you need to be seen by one to check but from what you say it's possible you chipped one tooth and your bite is trying to settle so that may be why you have some aches and pains.    I'd strongly suggest you see a dentist to make you a comfortable guard and put your mind at rest.   It's really unlikely your teeth are damaged.  It's easy to get anxious when something goes wrong with your teeth because it can make everything feel wrong.  But it can help to see a professional to put your mind at rest.

Thing is dentists seem to have been saying similar things about this tooth for years and yet it's still going with no pain at all. Any chance of filling it and it holding on?If I have to go for an extraction, do you think I should go to a specialist or would my regular dentist be about as skilled? I think my regular dentist is a good one and I've experienced some bad dentists in the past. Will this be an easy extraction or difficult? I've never had any impacted teeth.Also what is the time frame I should try and get it done in? When it was stated maybe I should get rid of it before or it might be a harder extraction in the end, I didn't think much of it... I thought who cares if the process is a little longer or more complicated compared to losing a tooth. I never realized I'd be taking on the risk of damaging the nerve, paresthesia, and other horrible complications that might be long-term. LifeIsHard: Another thing is that if I go in as a non-return patient, I am a random person in a big city to the oral surgeon, not someone familiar and local. It seems like since I'm a continual \"returning customer\" my current dentist would have more incentive to make sure it's done right. So from all of these things, it makes sense to me that my current dentist might be more careful, but if that's more than offset by the extra experience of an oral surgeon maybe I am better off with the latter? Cost may also be a factor, I don't know if an oral surgeon would be more expensive or not. Busybee: complex extractions are best done by an expert but get a second opinion if you have no symptoms.

Another thing is that the longer you leave it, the worse the extraction is likely to be as the tooth can go down very close to the nerve.When getting it out, the oral surgeon asked me what tooth was bothering me and he seemed surprised when I said none were and there was no pain at all. I'm a real advocate of \"if it's not broken don't fix it\", in particular with medicine due to some experiences I've had in the past. I prefer to take a natural route - even though the natural route may end up bad sometimes the medical route may end up worse and there's a philosophical element to it as well - how do animals deal with it in the wild and why they seem to rarely or never get such maladies is a major question. However I think I can safely say that this time it was warranted and worth it, not much point leaving it in.MattKW said:\t\t\tIt's a wisdom tooth with a huge cavity.

SEE ATTACHED PIC\nI’d like to avoid an implant and persevere with the crown and post.How did it become fractured? I do not know for sure except to say it may have been fractured from the very start due to the whack in my mouth.20 years ago.I’ve been warned of bacteria entering where the fracture is and it causing problems, but if the fracture happened 20 years ago over that period bacteria has not caused a problem yet so am ignoring the “be afraid of bacteria so you better get an implant” argument.  Even so, the fracture is well below the gum line and it has not been explained to me how bacteria can be an issue other than the argument just , well, simply sounding right.  After all, can’t bacteria enter down into where implants are installed anyway?Dentists have cleaned out the canal before re-cementing on previous repairs. I guess this makes the canal that little bit worse-of-a-fit each time this happens.  The last two times the crown and post have loosened after 8 and 4 months. Previously it lasted many years before coming loose.  Even with the fracture , if the canal is the right fit and the right glue is used it should stay stuck.  One dentist I asked couldn’t tell me how the fracture relates to the post coming out.So, what to do? A dentist simply cleaning out the canal and re-cementing will most likely result in a loose crown again. Unless they use a different type of glue?  Or,I can recommend other techniques.  Perhaps use a filler down the canal and re-drill a nice fitting hole to refit the post . Or drill out a slightly bigger hole and remake a new post for the crown that fits better.\nCan anyone recommend another method to make the crown and post stay in? PIC ATTACHED. David Ujcic: OP here again. Nobody around. Let you know I've made appointment to stick crown with Glass Ionomer cement this time to see how long she lasts. Hoping to get a couple of years out of it. joss: Well? Did it work? David Swenser: Yes. Many clinics in pattaya. Thailand didnt have glass ionomer. Finally the bangkok-pattaya hospital dentistry department had it. Again the dentist wanted to do implant as the best option. About 2-3,000 us dollars for implant. \nI was heading back to oz shortly so she got me to sign a waiver and went ahead with a permanent glass ionomer glue. She showed me the glue so I was confident. She wasn't confident it would last more than months. 1 and a half years later it is still super strong and feeling good too. Cost to glue wit xray 50 us dollars.\nI'm very happy and recommend glass ionomer glueing of crowns and for fillings or other repair.\nI've bought my own glue from eBay but haven't needed it yet. \nKind regards and thanks for your interest. joss: I've not heard of this glue, but good to know. I wonder if they use it in the states.\nA fractured tooth can cause problems [ I had one] seems bacteria can seep into fracture [ I rinsed constantly with peroxide] cause pain, and cannot be fixed [ so I was told] I like your suggestion of filling the canal [ maybe with this type glue?] Drilling a larger one might compromise the tooth, unless it's a large molar. At any rate, dentists here also like to push implants, and yes, they average 3k. Is it me, or has the cost of dental work sky-rocketed? \nWhat made you think the type of glue you used on your tooth would work? Do you deal with this in other applications?\nSo your saying implant in your country is just as expensive? I would have thought cheaper for some reason.regards David Swenser: I haven't got a quote in Australia.  I can only imagine close to 6000 bucks US\nThailand has them starting from around 1400 US\nI just was using reasoning to try and understand and understood that the common dentist cement worked on reliance of the stickiness of two close objects like how two glass panes close together will stick together, so i knew that a glue was needed that worked differently. Google threw up all the types and I felt glass ionomer fitted the bill best. They have fluoride protection built in too. \nI was amazed that 5 smaller dentists in Thailand hadn't heard of it or couldn't help.\nId ike to try and glue Random objects with it and see how it compares to other glues.Maybe one day I will need an implant due to decay or infection. Or maybe I'll get away with it for the next 40 years."

That presents with more folds on your face looking like wrinkles.  I'm not sure if you had your present dentures made before your teeth were extracted (Immediate Dentures) and delivered at the time of teeth extraction so you would have teeth to chew on.  If so, they don't fit as accurate due to the changes in you bone and consider new set of dentures.  If costs are prohibitive, consider a temporary measure of relining them."

I was worried about an infection coming up so I had an emergency appointment to get a temporary filling with another dentist in my area. (7th November)The dentist said that I had bad decay and he cleaned it all out before doing the temporary filling. I had no pain before this temporary filling. However, now I do suffer from a little bit of a pain. It’s not unbearable, and I struggle to drink a cold drink but I can drink hot drinks. The odd thing is, the pain sometimes is in a different tooth, I’ve read online that this is called referred pain but I don’t know too much about this. The pain is somewhat of a dull ache, with the occasional sensitivity. I’ve changed over to sensydone toothpaste which I’m hoping will help. The pain usually occurs when I first wake up and after I’ve eaten. Is it something that I should be worried about or should I wait until the 5th December? MattKW: Unfortunately you don't have a lot of choice. It could be the damaged tooth (most likely), or it could be another tooth. Either way, a toothache is a sign of moderate to severe decay, so prepare your thoughts for either extraction or RCT as most likely choices.

I’m ready for just to be extracted at this point. Do you know what could have caused my filling to go this colour? I used toothpaste prescribed by the doctor, brush my teeth twice a day and try to stay away from sugar. It’s literslly come on out of no where. I’ve heard that iron tablets can cause this, and I did start taking three types of iron tablets yesterday but I doubt that’s caused this? Also heard it could be to do with the type of filling used or a leakage but I don’t know what type of filling was used."

The best way to protect against real cracks is to not abuse your teeth with food or substances that should not be chewed.  For example avoid chewing boiled sweets, be careful of popcorn kernels that have not popped, do not use your teeth as a tool for holding pens and other objects, you have hands for that.  Check fish for any bones. When you do chew do it mindfully and don't just chomp down on food that may contain hard chunks.    If you think you are a grinder get your dentist to make you a nightguard.  You can control your jaw in the day but at night we all need help.I cracked a tooth crunching on a mint.  Thankfully it was repaired without the need for root treatment or extraction.   Well done on getting your teeth cleaned, but try to relax about the craze line because worrying can make you grind! DrPhilHellmuth: I totally agree with Busybee!"

    "dialogue": "Whatteeth: I have an unusually bad dental situation. Nearly all of my teeth need to be extracted; nearly half are broken at the gum line.My preference is to want to get implants for all of them, not to go to dentures.This is where it gets hard with the questions.In theory, I have some minimal insurance that would cover extractions, but in practice it has almost no providers. For example, one of the few providers accepting it is booked until into 2019. And bone grafts aren't covered anyway.So that makes it likely to just pay for everything. Calling local oral surgeons, the prices seem to range from about $220-$900 per tooth, plus about $750-$900 for a bone graft. One has an estimate of $900-$2000 for both per tooth.Some want $100-$200 for a consultation even to say their prices.Saying 15 teeth, that alone is perhaps $20,000 for extractions and bone grafts. Then the implants seem to be about $5,000 each from a quality provider - maybe $3,000 if you 'shop around' for value - another $50k-$75k.It's hard to know where to find value, how to find quality, even what questions to ask. You find there are a lot of things about quality you don't even know to ask.And then there's the international option. I don't know if providers in this forum have a bias against that as a competitor, but of course there are legitimate risks and tradeoffs and benefits with the option.But try to find the better options on that - it's easy to find many options, but not to feel you have found the 'good ones'. The resources mainly seem to be paid referral sites, and the providers' own websites.Which makes sense - who has actually gone to hundreds of offices to compare them around the world? That'd cost a lot and I know of no independent service reviewer who does that.Which leaves little but 'word of mouth' type info like someone saying 'I went there and here's my experience'.It's a lot to look at something like a $100k expense for this. I could be pretty sure of good quality with a local provider for that $100k figure. But if I could find as good or better internationally for less than half and save $50,000 that's attractive.Currently, I spent yesterday in some pain from the root/sinus area on the left with 4 teeth broken at the gumlines (I basically have the two front teeth left for biting upper/lower). Last night aleve/tylenol made the pain go away.And even if I spend a lot to do this, there's how long they'll last. I hear 10 years, I head 30 years... I wouldn't want to have to re-purchase this in 10 or 15 years.And then there's the question whether I should consider other options I've barely heard about in some cases - not only dentures, but things like bridges so multiple teeth use one implant.Don't really know the tradeoffs there in cost/quality/how long it lasts/etc.Clearly I've spent years putting off getting this done as more teeth have broken off. Just thought I'd share the experience of looking for the right option and listen to comments with suggestions.One other option is looking for places in the US that are good and more affordable - I remember a 'dental school' in North Carolina that did a great job on something if I could find them again, if they do this work (probably not).And then I see these 'low-cost implant' services advertising but don't feel comfortable with the quality yet from them unfortunately. And anyone who can be asked tends to have their own interests to protect. MattKW: If you haven't been able to maintain your natural teeth, then I would worry about giving you implants. You need to be absolutely on top of your diet and hygiene before embarking on implants. Apart from the obvious cost, it's like getting a nice car - the maintenance is higher. So, if you smoke, have a sugary diet, and don't maintain excellent hygiene, then you'll be wasting your time and money.\nI like all my implant patients to go to a periodontist for the purpose of getting good hygiene, assessing their risks, and for the implant surgery (they handle gums well).\nAs for overseas (tourism dentistry), the problem is that you don't know what you'll be getting. there are plenty of implant systems in the world, and if you want your implants to last you need to have big-brand types. Would you buy a Lada while visiting Russia? I've seen some patients come back from overseas with systems that I can't find parts for. asdf1234: I have several implants.  I have all of my teeth crowned except for 6 on the bottom which have veneers.As far as price I started out as a patient at a dental college.  Implants ran me $500 each there. I also learned a lot about teeth which helped me make much more informed decisions in the future as I have needed work done.As far as prices I recently had two extractions and three implants with bone grafting placed all in one surgery. This was at a private dentist. It cost me 3500$ total for everything without crowns, and I will have to buy my abuntments later for 100$ each.  I found a discount dental plan online and pay less than 450$ for pfm crowns, but there is a small selection of dentists who take this plan.I too did not want dentures, but I did have to wear a partial for a while. What you are wanting to do is very possible.  However you should know it is tough.  Half of my face is swollen up after extractions, grafts, and implants 2 days ago.  Yesterday was very painful, even with pain meds I could not sleep. Whatteeth: Thanks for the reply. What dental school did you find? I wonder how good an option finding one of those it.The main local one is the State University and they aren't really cheaper than private... asdf1234: Accurate prices over the phone are hard to get.  My implants were 1,000$ each at the graduate college if you just came in and wanted that.  However once I got assigned to a student and the implant was approved as part of my whole mouth restoration treatment plan the price dropped to 500 plus the price of a crown signed off as necessary, etc.If you want to go the private dentist route, which is what I do now.  You will need to Google discount dental plans, and study the various plans.  Then check the area where they have dentists who accept the plans.  Some plans are less for root canals, but higher for crowns. You can have multiple plans.  Then call the dentist to make certain they will take the plan, and honor the prices.  I have found nobody to take these plans for implants.  But extractions, crowns, veneers, bridges have been no problem.  These prices were often the same as the college.  Implants being the exception.I used affordable dentures and implants for implants.  I actually drove a great distance to go to more than one location.  I did read bad reviews about them, but it was people complaining about their dentures not fitting and so forth.  I did have to go in there knowing exactly what I wanted them to do.  I had to be a little pushy, and ask if I could get the crowns elsewhere. Whatteeth: It's worrisome to consider splitting up work all over. It'd be nice to find one place somewhere in the world to do all of it with good quality and value. asdf1234: Indeed it would be nice, but when you are talking about major restorative work it depends how determined you are. Most go with pulling all teeth and dentures, as implants, veneers, crowns, root canals are out of reach financially.  For those who can afford them they are not willing to go through the trauma and pain involved. DrPhilHellmuth: That sounds really bad! I am sorry to hear that :-("

    "dialogue": "MetalCountry: Earlier this year I had a cavity in my upper tooth in which th e dentist said was abcessed. First question is I suppose is should he have filled it? Because he never done a root canal or antibiotics just filled it.Because, the past almost 5 months I got misdiagnosed  as what we thought was a sinus infection till my 3rd ER visit and said I had 3 abcessed teeth. After 6 rounds of antibiotics I was able to make a dental appointment When I explained she basically said he set me up as a volcanoe effect the vaping wasnt the main cause but he filled it and it broke down. I do smoke but been vaping which she said really wasnt the problem it will just keep coming to a head and rupture until she does the root canal since the bone has gone around the entire tooth. Is vaping really a issue?Now silly third question, my boyfriend is flying in. I have antibiotics but sexually speaking and educational ignorance to this I will admit. Can I still perform oral and kiss him without worry? I know like any infection I am at risk, but for him is it okay? I have tried looking but not much luck. Busybee: If your dentist found an abscess then he should have referred you to a specialist for a root treatment.   Are the other infected teeth next to it or in other parts of your mouth?You cannot transmit a dental infection to a partner.  It's not contagious.How is your oral hygiene?  I've not heard that vaping affects your teeth. MattKW: Vaping nicotine products is still being studied, but early indications are that it is still a risk factor for gum disease. Cigarettes have more chemicals than nicotine alone. MetalCountry: Busybee said:\t\t\tIf your dentist found an abscess then he should have referred you to a specialist for a root treatment.

I've not heard that vaping affects your teeth.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Hygiene wise I brush regularly, floss, and use mouthwash. This was unexpected as the tooth he filled went numb. No pain at first then it was my upper face like a sinus infection and even the er doctor said so they wouldn't do a CT with as much pain as I was in. Then days later my main front tooth went numb then the canine was in pain. The new dentist she tested and done multiple xrays. I was scared being frontal I would have to have it pulled but she don't want that she said root canal. however have to call because it seems odd the next appointment for it is January and being my other teeth are impacted I don't see her wanting to wait so long and the fact I can use antibiotics it heals up then about a week or later it comes to a head and ruptures in my gums and leaks. So I have been now using sea salt regularly. MetalCountry: MattKW said:\t\t\tVaping nicotine products is still being studied, but early indications are that it is still a risk factor for gum disease.

Then tried the vape, but that's when this happened and the one er doctor was rude saying it was a  negative effect when vaping why the abscess keeps coming back. Tried patches but only seem to help first few hours. But the dentist Said that it was inevitable as until she does the root canal this will happen and antibiotics are like a bandaid."

    "title": "Infection?",
    "dialogue": "asdf1234: Hello...Male mid 40's Extensive dental work.  (Several Implants, crowns, one bridge)I had an implant placed in my lower left molar tooth 30 about 3-4 years ago.  Last year the implant got infected(I forget the terminology here) and it had to be removed.  This was very painful. Several months later I elected to have a 3 unit cantilever bridge placed on tooth 28-29 which also covered missing tooth 30.  All is great until last week.  The tooth slowly started to feel uncomfortable, then it was very sensitive to hot and cold, then it started hurting BADLY!  Yesterday I went to a dentist.(not the one who placed the bridge)  The dentist took x-rays, and saw no signs of infection.  Since I have not been flossing under tooth 29 I was educated about superfloss, and told my gums were severely inflamed.  They bled badly when floss was run through.The pain has since gotten better, but I cannot have anything touch 28, 29, or 30, or else I will scream in pain.  I tried some salt water, and that HURT!  I cannot put any pressure on any part of the bridge or it HURTS!The way this has been hurting, throbbing, and cycles of severe pain I am thinking infection or abcess as I have been through this many times.  I am contemplating a root canal for 28, and 29 with my bridge intact.  I thought about implants, but I simply don't have enough bone for an implant in 30, and what is the point of having implants placed for 2 teeth to end up with another cantilever bridge.I dunno really.  Thoughts?  I need to make a decision soon. MattKW: Cantilever bridge from 28 and 29 to make up for missing 30 is asking for trouble. Cut off 30 pontic, and hope that 28 and 29 recover. You can only replace the 30 with an implant, or not at all. honestdoc: I agree with Dr. MattKw.  If you can't have implant #30 due to past failure, consider partial denture or nothing.  Partial dentures on lower arch may feel awkward and difficult to get used to. asdf1234: Thanks for the Reply.  I was mistaken about the numbers it is 19, 20, and 21, but your reply still stands valid.  The pain has dropped significantly down to still hurting but I am sure to only mess with liquids at room temp.I have been looking through my old previous xrays.  I did go back to the dentist today, and my options are steering me in one direction.  Maybe some advice here would help some.  I will upload some xrays if I can.1.) I can have root canals done on 20, and 21 through my bridge.  If there is anything going on under the bridge I could end up getting extractions.2.) I can have the bridge removed in sections hopefully not damaging the teeth below, and then look at root canal treatment.3.) I am not an expert but it looks to me like my failed implant on tooth 19 has healed up nicely.  I don't see significant bone loss, but again I am not an expert maybe someone here can have a looksie. This pic is from 2017 right before the implant was removed for I think this is the right term( peri-implantitis ) asdf1234: Here is my xrays from last week.\nThe half moon circle thing on 21 is something with their camera I seen it on all my xrays. MattKW: The semicircle to the bottom left is some artifact of the Xray process and means nothing. I am a little concerned about the dip below the crown (yellow arrow). I would be pulp testing 20 and 21.  Then, cut off that false tooth. A cantilever bridge like that is going to cause damage to the supporting 20 and 21.\nIf that doesn't relieve the pain, remove the crowns on 20 and 21 and place temporary crowns.\nIf that doesn't reveal anything or relieve your pain, then maybe RCTs and single crowns. But I doubt if it's both teeth causing your problems. asdf1234: The dentist I seen today who took xrays Friday mentioned the same spot as you.  What relieves the pain significantly is to push down on the last tooth number 19, and hold.  Although I don't feel the bridge move at all when I do this.Looking at the picture more.  I wonder if the bridge has moved recently, and tooth a piece of number 20 with it.I do appreciate the reply.  I am happy to have some time not in agonizing pain to make a decision.I am going to see an implant specialist tomorrow for xray and consultation.  They only charge 1$ for the initial. \nIf I can have two extractions and three implants placed in one sitting I may just do that. They said very possible since the molar is already extracted/healed.  They quoted me between $3,000 - $3,500 for the 3 implants, and healing abutments if I get my crowns somewhere else.  $7,500 for 3 implants with crowns. MattKW: So, you've already had 1 implant fail, and you are taking a big chance by taking out 2 salvageable teeth and placing more implants? Natural teeth are the best \" implants\" you'll ever get. \nAlso, there's no need to replace 3 teeth with 3 implants when 2 implants with a bridge may do the job with less risk. I don't know where you are, but 3 implants and 3 crowns for $7500 is ridiculously cheap. honestdoc: I agree again with Dr. MattKW.  I'm concerned there may be miscommunication and expectations may not be aligned.  Getting the cantilever bridge especially with a molar pontic was a big mistake.#20 has possible external root resorption on the root tip and #21 has bifurcated root canals at mid root that will be a challenge to instrument (clean & shape) if needed. asdf1234: I appreciate the replies very much.  It is really great to get different opinions from real dentists.I visited the implant specialist today.  They told me 20, and 21 are no problem.  Implants are fine there. 19 however is risky because of the amount of bone.  A short implant can be placed, but bone grafting and a longer implant would be ideal.  I am ok with taking the risk using the short implant.I am going Friday too see my regular dentist to have a bridge made up top for 12-14.  I assume it will be better to have it made before having anything done to the bottom teeth? asdf1234: 20 and 21 came out rather easily..."

Otherwise your teeth could become loose over time. honestdoc: It looks like herpetic gingivostomatitis.  Have your dentist or doctor prescribe you some oral acyclovir.

    "dialogue": "Busybee: I thought I'd post about this in case others have had similar problems.   I have been using Sensodyne products for several years now with no problems.   However, recently I started developing a burning tongue and soreness inside my lips.  I had an ulcer, then another, which is really unusual for me.   I was really puzzled as to what was causing it as I hadn't changed my diet.     I then realised that it was getting worse every time I brushed my teeth.  The paste was really burning.   I stopped using it and resumed using the \"daily care\" version.  It got a lot better but now that version is also causing my mouth to burn.   The ulcers have gone since I stopped using the Rapid Relief but there is something wrong here. I looked online and apparently the manufacturer changed the formula earlier this year.   Many others have complained of the same symptoms on social media.   I was wondering whether anyone else has had any problems and whether dentists were aware of this issue.   After all it's a top brand that most health professionals recommend to patients.   Does anyone know which ingredient could trigger such a strong reaction?  I'd like to avoid it in other brands. MattKW: No idea. Perhaps you'll have to experiment with different brands and formulations. Look for a \"Plain Toothpaste\"; there's one called that here in Aust. that I give to dry mouth patients because it has no SLS; maybe there's something similar in UK.. Or even give up on toothpaste altogether for a while, just use a plain brush. My Dad used to make me brush with salt, but I couldn't do that nowadays! Busybee: Thanks MattKW, I was thinking of brushing with sonicare and water this morning, but tried the colgate total again and had none of the painful burning symptoms.   I've never thought of brushing without paste prior to this, we are so used to using it that it seems very strange to go without.Since I stopped using the Sensodyne \"Rapid Relief\" a couple of days ago everything seems to have healed.   I was looking at an old tube that I bought in a pound store a few months ago and they have completely changed the formula.  There is something called \"PEG-8\" that is a new major ingredient so perhaps that is causing the problem.   We don't have plain toothpaste in the UK but it's a real eye opener to look into some of the ingredients in paste.  Some child pastes even contain non-biodegradable micrcobeads to make it look pretty on the brush... honestdoc: We have a large naturopathic presence in the Pacific NW.  Stores like Whole foods and local organic markets sell all-natural products.  A well-known brand is called Tom's of Maine which is owned by Colgate.  I'm not sure if the UK have markets like this.  Downside is these products are 3 times more costly."

If you are continuing to traumatize it like a tic (chewing on nails, etc) it may get worse.  If you are grinding and occluding (biting) on that tooth more, may need to adjust it so it won't torque the tooth too much.Treatment options are to do nothing which is cheaper, less painful and traumatic, and the defect is not very noticeable.  Gum graft may be an option which is expensive and can be very painful and traumatic.  However, it benefits by reinforcing stronger keratinized tissue."

Some do it more severe with more damage/trauma. John Roberts: I had a sleep study done to see if I grind my teeth and I didn't that night.  I know for sure I don't grind or clench my teeth during the daytime.  The way they are, I couldn't do that. I do feel like my bite is off and it constantly changes.

Have had trouble with my teeth since a dental appointment for cleaning  and flouride  contentment two years ago.\nThank you for the comment and if you have any suggestions I am listening.  Thanks Busybee: I remember you John.  How have you been and how is the pain recently?    Have any of your symptoms abated?  Chewing cheeks is not unusual.  It's not worth having treatment because they might adjust your teeth and cause bigger problems. John Roberts: Hey Busybee. Haven't been on here in a while. I would say my symptoms are the same.  Been going to a neurologist who diagnosed me with trigeminal  nerulgia. I am on anticonvulsant medication.  I don't think I have tn, maybe atypical nerulgia.  The medication for bot is about the same.  What I am on has done  no good.  Teeth still hurt all the time and bite feels off and seems like it constantly changes.  It feels like it is more on the right side. I was asking about the cheek biting.  This just started a while back.  Very annoying and painful.  I may talk to the dentist about it and see what he says.  Anyway, good to talk with you. Busybee: John I'm sorry you are still in pain and discomfort.   It really is not easy to fix something like this and I know how distressing it is.   Anticonvulsants are pretty strong so if they are not helping at all speak to the neuro about getting off them. John Roberts: I am waiting for the doctor to call.  He is a out of town doctor. I am going to tell him the medicine isn't working and see what he offers.  He called just a while ago.  I have to go in next Tuesday.  All my teeth hurt but what is really bothering me is tooth or teeth 4 & 5  on the top and 28& 29 on the bottom.  They feel like they are high.  One minute it feel like the top is bothering me then the bottom is bothering me.  It switches back and forth.  It feels like the right side is where my teeth settle.  Right now sitting here it feels like my bottom teeth are high.  I am thing about going in and letting the dentist take a small amour off these teeth and see if it helps.  It has felt like this for a while now.  \nYou are right about the anticonvulsants.  If they aren't doing any good I need to get off them. This has been going on almost two years now.  Thanks for the advice"

    "dialogue": "Babyboo: My Mum is allergic to Lidocaine meaning she has to be given alternative anaesthesia. However, she is also allergic to many other things, including cobalt, chromium and a severe nickel reaction. Her dentist has not changed the tools he works with so she reacts every visit.I just wanted to know if there are alternative tools a dentist can use that are free from these metals?Thanks MattKW: It is almost impossible to be allergic to lidocaine. Usually it's other ingredients in the solution that cause the allergy. And many people say they're allergic when really they've had an adverse reaction. Mum should be tested by an hospital immunologist - lidocaine is widely used in dentistry and medicine. She should also get testing for the metal responses by a immunologist. Your Mum should have an Epipen at the ready.\nI just had my 2nd case in 35 years of an allergy to lidocaine with adrenaline solution - blood pressure drop, wheezing, and urticaria. After testing, it was found NOT to be an allergy to lidocaine, but probably sodium metabisulfite (couldn't be tested directly). So now the patient knows she can have plain solutions of lidocaine, prilocaine, and mepivacaine - all easily available in dentistry and medicine."

Do you prescribe opioids and if so what guidelines do you yourself follow in administering them? Dosing, numbers prescribed and recall interval are all possible follow up issues.3. Do you screen for substance abuse? If so, how? Do you use any screening tools (written or verbally; CAGE-AID)?4. What do you say and how do you say it in learning about any possible abuse? Verbal and nonverbal communication included.5. If a patient has a perceived or overtly shared drug abuse problem then how do you manage this situation? Advise? Assisting? Referral? honestdoc: 1.  I would diagnose the patient if it is tooth related or something else.  If it is tooth related, I would treat it appropriately such as restoration, root canal, or extraction.  If I can't determine the source of pain, I refer the patient to his/her medical doctor for evaluation of possible sinus pain or other conditions such as Trigeminal Neuralgia.  Dr. Jeffrey Okeson from University of Kentucky has great information on non-dental pain in the oral area.2.  I do prescribe opioids.  If it is an intial visit, I review the medical history and interview the patient.  I will usually take care of the acute problem on the same day.  I will prescribe opioids after treatment or if I can't complete the procedure.  I will not prescribe if the patient refuses treatment.  Dosing is usually 5.0 to 7.5 mg Hydrocodone, 5.0 mg Oxycodone, 30 mg Codeine.3.  I only screen suspected abusers.  We have a state opioid database.4.  Ask patients about their history of pain medication/street drug use.  It can be difficult to determine validity.5. Discuss drug rehab and NSAIDs use. ngheibid: You are truly my savior right now!

    "dialogue": "Lyle MacLeod: Does anyone know of any method for whitening your teeth at home? I'd like to try some of these out before I get them professionally whitened just in case I find them white enough afterwards. I've heard of eating strawberries and oil pulling but are there anymore I could try? Cheers Busybee: I had a yoga teacher who cleaned her teeth by pulling coconut oil.  She had really white teeth.  I have no idea of the risks or benefits.    Seemed a lot of fuss though and you have to keep doing it. Lyle MacLeod: I guess it is but could be worth it.I've heard you need to do it everyday for 2 weeks and then twice per week afterwards. Busybee: I think she did it every day instead of brushing in the conventional way. Lyle MacLeod: Aw I never realised you could do it this way. I guess it could be more convenient. Uptown101: Try brushing with baking soda, baking soda has natural whitening properties, which is why it's a popular ingredient in commercial toothpaste. KVMCruces: Be careful about using baking soda, it can cause damage to your enamel. You should research what a safe amount to use is and for how long.The best way to whiten your teeth without causing any damage is using coconut oil and mixing it with activated charcoal. I have my son do this since he doesn't really need professional whitening (hes 13).If you're looking to get really pearly whites, then try Crest 3D whitening strips. I used them myself and my teeth were 3-4 shades lighter within a month. Be careful with these as well, my teeth were sensitive after using them (when used daily). Sensitivity wore off after a day or two. Try not to use them daily, should help with that problem. Lyle MacLeod: Cheers guys, I'll do some research into baking soda and I'll also check out those Crest 3D whitening strips. I'm not too bothered about getting really white teeth, just a few shades whiter than they are now - probs best to try the baking soda first. Burstoralcare: You should try to use toothpaste that have active ingrediant like Sodium Fluoride. I have found few toothpastes like Colgate, Burst, Meswak that have sodium fluoride in it."

    "dialogue": "Sam23: Hi,My gut is telling me they did wrong but I need to confirm.I've had bruxism for the past few years and I've just had a mouth guard for my front two teeth made for me. I've never had  to go to the dentist for anything like this before.I was late and the receptionist gave me the guard and said I can try it on in the toilets.  I was shocked and she noticed and said it's normal to try it on there and then go home.  I told her this doesn't seem right.  I walked to the toilet and opened the door and just shut it again.  Came back to the receptionist and she asked how the fit was.  I said it seems fine.She could obviously tell I wasn't happy and I was putting the guard in its box and taking my coat to go home.  She then walked away and came back a few minutes later to say the dentist will see me.The dentist made me try it on, asked how it felt.  I didn't expect it to be so thick and high and she explained it was because it only covered the front four teeth.  She then made a big deal about how my back teeth may move when wearing this gaurd after a prolonged period of time.Is this normal to try the guard in the toilets?  Surely it can't be because it is so unhygienic.Thanks in advance,Sam Busybee: Not it's not normal to try a guard on in the toilets.  You try it on in the dentist's chair.  The type of guard you describe isn't good to wear long term because some have found it can lead to an open bite on your back teeth.  You should only use it for a few weeks to see if it brings relief.  More as a diagnostic tool. MattKW: It's odd to try it on in the toilet - what would it prove? You still have to get the dentist to place and adjust it.\nBusybee's sort of correct - these are only designed to be short term use because the back teeth can overerupt (overgrow), and then you develop an openbite with your front teeth. For long term use, you need a full arch coverage splint (Michigan design)."

I have personally seen a sailboat arrive and send their kids ashore to give out BAGS of lollipops !A year ago we provided 10 electric tooth brushes and every child has their own electric brush head. The brushes are kept in the Helt Centa (Health Centre) and charged by a small amount of solar power.At 20 seconds in you can see an old guitar case that has been converted for storing 200 individual brush heads. All the positions are numbered and the brush heads are individually numbered for each child. We provide new heads every 3-4 months.The community has totally engaged with the project and we have increased this to 20 electric tooth brushes so each school day the children walk in groups of 20 from the school to the Helt Centa and solar-electric brush their teeth. Techo NZ:  MattKW: Fantastic job! Hope it delivers great dividends. honestdoc: Techo NZ, thank you for your services! Techo NZ: It cost about $1,200 for the hardware and freight to get it there which works out at $6 per child.Ongoing costs are $600 a year for 2 large tubes of toothpaste per week, and another $600 per year for replacement heads every 4 months (thanks Ebay !), which works out at $6 per child per year (12c per child per week) . That’s a pretty good bang for ya oral health buck Techo NZ: Sitting around the fire at night (swatting misquitoes) we blue-sky think about expanding it for everyone on the island, population 1,200.We envisage a cyclone proof cupboard off the back of the Helt Centa with 20 or 30 solar powered electric toothbrushes and 1,200 brush heads with stainless benches and water taps and sinks.The Helt Centa is central to the village so anyone at anytime can go and clean their teeth with their own brush head, and then we think we could duplicate this project in thousands of other remote villages around the world. Exciting stuff. Techo NZ: 6 of us leaving tomorrow, 2 days, 3 planes and a boat to get there. 200+kg of equipment and supplies, our personal clothing and toiletries is limited to our 7kg carry and to last us 2 weeks !We have lots of projects going on:\nWe have begun advocating for cleft palettes with several successful operations already done.\nWe have 200 new toothbrush heads and more toothpaste and even after just 12 months of the 'Sola Leckie Pikinini Klin Tut Project \" (Solar Electric Child Clean Tooth Project) we look forward to the data showing some oral health improvement.\nAnd with our new portable mini X-Ray we can do high quality digital developing.Another exciting project is underway to build a (cyclone proof) solar powered dental clinic on Aneityum Island ! so we can train the locals in oral health care and for visiting dentists to provide a higher level of care.We are also designing and building portable solar powered dental carts, with electric hand pieces for high-slow and a triple syringe and scaler. and a total weight of only 10kg per system complete with a mini air compressor ! Designed to be light and easy to carry and to run on small solar systems.We are super pleased to not just do 2 weeks of RoP and drill and fill but to build a legacy of a dental clinic and empower the island with a lifetime brushing program. Once we perfect this project we want to see it grow into the Pacific, or for that matter anywhere.\nNot bad for a bunch of kiwi volunteers ha ha.\nOur motto in Bislama is \"Sua, tricki bae hemi no impossibol \"  ('\"Sure is tricky but this thing is not always impossible \")\nHere;' a link to our page. https://afriendofkokorosa.org/ a few videos of different projects.If you like what we do there's even a donate button ;-) you're welcxome to sponsor next years toothpaste   'Tangkiu Tumas ' (thank you too much"

Any help would be appreciated.*I have insurance. honestdoc: I would start with a complete checkup with full mouth x-rays and a pano. Please fill out a thorough health/medical history...I had patients not tell me they are on blood thinners, had heart attacks, diabetes, stroke, etc...I always ask to make sure.  Your blood pressure needs to be controlled and provide a complete list of all medications.  Have a solid conversation with your dentist of sedation options...there are risks.  After 10 years, hopefully you don't have severe gum and bone disease.  If so, you may need deep cleanings, possible gum surgeries, and recalls.   I would do the veneers after all the fillings and restorative needs are completed.  If you grind and clench, the veneers may have a high risk for failure...consider a custom bite guard.

    "title": "Pain management/the rx craze... Please read and consider if you are a dentist!",
    "dialogue": "Synaptrix777: I found this site and read through posts on a patient who was refused a rx after an extraction, and went through the whole process of registering just to respond/add my experience to this - I think it's important to have a patient's experience/feedback on here!I had a lower rear molar extracted 2 days ago, and have had 2 other extractions over the years. My first automatically included a prescription for I believe vicodan. From leaving the dentist's to going to the pharmacy, some of the novicaine began to wear off. Painful. By the time I was in the sitting area of the pharmacy, waiting for it to be filled, I was experiencing the most debilitating, agonizing pain - more pain than i have ever felt. When the pills started to kick in, it was an immediate relief, and a manageable pain from there on out. The second extraction was done at a different place, at a dentistry school. I was told that pain treatment consisted of taking the staggered ibproufen/advil mix, and that this offered the same level of pain relief, and \"was the same thing.\" I dutifully followed these directions, and within an hour or so started to experience the same horrible pain as before. I hesitate to even use the word pain, because I don't think this really conveys the level of extreme, debilitating agony that I am talking about. I tried to tough it out, wait for the regime I was given to set in.. and could not stand it. I drove (!) in a desperate move to the previous dentist I had seen. He helped me, and I don't know if there was anything wrong with doing so or any risk involved but I cannot appropriately convey my gratitude to him for that. Having for any amount of time, this kind of pain, even in going to and waiting for the prescription (going through this in public, no less!), is  a horrific thing to experience. \nThis time, I approached it proactively, and explained to my dentist the experiences I've had, and made absolute clear that I could not and would not go through this again. The result was (very nicely) another explanation that the staggered ibproufen offered the same pain relief, that it was actually \"the same thing\", that opiates just take your mind off of the pain, and so on. The receptionist chipped in later that in her opinion, people are prescribed these things too much, and again the oral surgeon repeated the whole mantra. All this, and I had a prescription written and the extraction done. Again, as I waited in line at the pharmacy, the numbness was wearing off, and in the 45 minutes it took to get that bottle in my hands, the same agonizing pain had started to come one and only got worse. I have been taking one every 5 hours or so, not getting much sleep, and have had to go to work and manage a store since. It is not in any way nice to have to work while spaced out and sleep deprived, but I would not be able to stand or afford the alternative. I would go to the ER if placed in that position. I would find someone to buy \"street drugs\" from to not experience that. Isn't it a little crazy I would not hesitate to engage in illegal activities to alleviate this? How could I even be brought to think of that as an option, when the care I need is so easily possible to be provided to me? (I work hard! Pay a huge portion of my income, with that hard earned money, jump through the hoops I need to, deal with the on and off pain in my teeth, and live with a constant fear that I will never be able to catch up with the dental issues I face. I deal with more than enough, on my own end of my dental woes!)So, I understand the epidemic rise of prescription drug abuse going on right now. I understand doctors having a responsiblity to be careful, to avoid being a supplier, to avoiding possible charges, etc. However, this seems to be leading to an unacceptable imbalance. I have for the first time ever experienced what I would label presumed guilt instead of presumed innocence (guilty of seeking drugs vs. genuine need for care), experienced mistrust, suspicion, and implication. It is natural that I feel demeaned by this, it is in fact the right feeling in my situation. My stance now MUST be proactive to ensure I receive the care I need, and ironically, this stance also labels me as having potentially \"drug-seeking\" behaviors. In researching this, it is apparent that something must be done. I have no idea how, as a practice, network of practices, or even nation of practices, this can be addressed and resolved, but it must.I do know people experience pain differently. There aren't absolutes, only probabilities that what was effective for one is effective for another in a lot of these issues. There is science, studies and data (opiate vs. ibproufen in this case) that we can make decisions based on, but one's experience of pain is fact for them, and cannot be swept aside. The one point that came to my mind when talking to my current dentist, is that I suppose the prescription simply \"taking my mind off of the pain\" must in fact be a crucial part of pain management, for me. I can't understand that and it does not seem logical or believable that the prescription I got doesn't have a clearly identified, scientifically proven, higher, stronger dosage of pain alleviating properties. If this is absolutely true (I can't fathom it, at all), then there is an entire conversation that is being missed in the whole pain management debate, theory, what have you - isn't there?Thank you to anyone who actually read all of this (sorry it's so long!), and for any responses/suggestions/knowledge that might glean some light on this whole topic... I would really appreciate any information to help me understand or resolve this. Mona Lisa: I read the whole thing. I too, am having the same issues with my cervical spine and they have prescribed me only muscle relaxers 3xs a day which does not kill the pain and knocks me out. I have oral surgery in 2 days. In my whole life I have had close to your first experience. Extraction, and then given approx. 10 Tylenol 3 with codeine and done! Now, I am very concerned about my upcoming surgery. I totally see your point and think ppl are freaking out over this opiate addiction. I have never been an addict, but my bf was....all prescriptive! Dentists coming to my home delivering his drugs in a small brown paper bag or calling past 7 PM. He threatened to sue my dentist and told him, \"You cannot tell me how much pain I am in by law. I will pick up another prescription or you'll be talking to my lawyer. He was already on Methadone, Valium and Neurontin. The dentist gave him a second script for opiates. No lie. I heard his pain management doctor was under federal investigation. Now, everyone is suffering because of these addicts. An extraction cannot be handled with naproxen. Ask for Torodal next time, imho better than anti inflammatory. Stick with your first dentist!Better luck next time! MattKW: Synaptrix, yes this is a difficult area of medicine/dentistry. The low dose codeine/acetaminophen drugs here in Australia have recently been taken to \"behind the counter\" because of the dependence and toxicity problems. I can still prescribe heavier doses, but the patient needs a prescription. The accepted wisdom for mild to moderate pain is not the staggered acetaminophen/ibuprofen regimen you mention, but a combination acetaminophen/ibuprofen (e.g. \"Nuramol\" taken for 1st 24 hrs. An additional option to consider if you have so much pain after an extraction is to ask for a longer lasting local anaesthetic, e.g. bupivacaine or ropivacaine. I routinely give that to all my surgical extraction patients, plus the Nuromal. Good luck. And Toradol can have some serious side-effects.

    "dialogue": "Guitarzan1: Hi everyone!I had all my fillings changed out about 7-8 years ago (around 8). Had invisalign shortly after and finished that about 6 years ago. Ever since the fillings, then invisalign I've had issues with grinding. Never had issues before. It's causing some gum issues and general soreness from grinding. My theory is that my bite is off. After I did the fillings I remember we had to do a lot of work to try and make my bite \"right\" since so much work was done. The thing that made me uneasy was that the dentist relied quite a bit on me saying if it felt right or not. She'd shave down some areas etc, asks if that felt good. If not she'd keep going. She did use this paper to check on her side but again, I had to just bite on it, and I wasn't sure if I was biting \"properly\". Meaning, I could alter my bite and it would show up differently on the paper. I sound a bit loony tunes I know, but I've been dealing so long...A few times I'd say it felt good then realize after a couple days it didn't. Went back multiple times until eventually it felt good enough I guess? I thought that the dentist would/should be able to do this without relying on my opinion of if it felt right or not. It seemed like no matter what she did it didn't feel perfect. The intense grinding started shortly after. Dentist just said my bite felt weird because I was so used to the old bit and had to adjust to the new bite.Now all these years later I still grind and have some gum issues due to it. My bite still doesn't feel flush or whatever. I sort of feel it hitting on one side then the other side feels elevated. Dentist said it looks fine to her but she can try again if I'm not happy. I'm just at a point where I'm not even sure what right is anymore! I just wish it could be done objectively by her without me saying it feels good or not. I've had it so long I'm not certain what is right / wrong, or a correct bite or bite that is off.Anyone have any advice or words of wisdom? I've been suffering with this grinding for a long time now and would like my bite fixed but I'm not sure how to go about it? Maybe just a 2nd opinion? Is the bite being \"right\" almost completely dependent  upon my opinion if it feels right or not? honestdoc: When you bite together, does it feel off?  If it feels off, do you shift your teeth until it feels right?  Do you have frequent headaches, sore jaws, pain, pain upon opening?  When your dentist is adjusting your bite, does she recline you back or keep you upright (you bite differently laying back)?Hopefully your dentist can re-establish you bite as best as possible and afterwards, you could try a custom bite guard.  If you don't notice improvement, consider visiting a TMJ specialist."

Would they have to pull them out and put them back in again? Thanks Busybee: Your own teeth look nice and stronger than the ones in the picture that you say are a perfect smile.  The picture shows a woman's teeth that have clearly been tampered with to make them look round at the ends & bleached or photo-shopped.    The two central incisors look very worn and as she ages they will wear down more and she won't have much biting surface on her incisors.   She also won't have much lip support.  But whether that affects her appearance will depend on the rest of the features and her bone structure.    She looks as though she has veneers at the side.  Her teeth have been built out to make that wider look. It is not simply a case of changing your teeth to look like someone else's.   You have nice healthy teeth and a great smile.   The least invasive method to achieve more width is to have some composite veneers as they don't have to remove any tooth for that.    Don't whatever you do go for porcelain veneers as they have all sorts of potential problems and can fall off or break.   Not all dentists are good at composite veneers.   There's an art to it.  Some try to sell porcelain veneers as they make money from it and it's easy because someone else does the art work.    Once you have cosmetic work you may still be unsatisfied and that will cause a vicious cycle.    Everyone has different bone structure and no dental surgeon should move your jaw for such a reason.   You haven't finished growing yet and your jaw will widen as you reach maturity.  Give it a chance to do that. user400: Busybee said:\t\t\tYour own teeth look nice and stronger than the ones in the picture that you say are a perfect smile.

I have looked into veneers, obviously you can’t really give me an accurate answer but do you think my smile would look like / look similar the one I got of google images if I got veneers? They are pretty expensive but I suppose it gives me a nice smile without going through surgery! Busybee: They may give you a wider smile but it wouldn't look like the one in the picture.  Your teeth & bone structure are completely different and having teeth just like the photo would make you look awful.    If you decide to go ahead with veneers don't go for porcelain (go for composite) and don't touch your front teeth.    You cannot replace the dental material they remove to place porcelain veneers.   You won't understand how bad that feels like until it happens.   The composite ones don't need any tooth material to be removed.   But any cosmetic dental work is going to alter the enamel even composite.    Anything you have done can ruin your teeth."

    "dialogue": "jc1199: I believe there should be a publicly funded and organized dental care system in the US. The same way we have a publicly operated Police, Fire, and military service. A way better use of tax payer money than giant tax cuts for the rich, corporate welfare, nuclear weapons, pointless wars, fighter jets, and massive bank bailouts. MattKW: Please write to your Congressman. One of the biggest stumbling blocks for publicly funded dentistry (or medicine) is that someone (i.e. the taxpayer) has to pay for it. And then the government has to regulate the whole shebang so there's an even balance. Dentists want more money for less work, and governments want more work for less money. So, it's never got up and going here in Australia. But if Busybee is up and about, she'll be able to talk from the British experience with the NHS. honestdoc: All the tax cuts you mentioned benefit the interests of those who have the resources to put the politicians into office.  Like Dr. MattKW mentioned, funding will always be a problem at the federal level.  The US has many states that are \"Red\" for Republican or \"Blue\" for Democratic control.  I live and work in a strong Blue state with many community dental clinics and gov't assistance...granted my taxes are way more than in the Red states.Unfortunately the US is more divided than ever and I don't want to debate on who is more wrong...tax cuts for the rich or care for the lazy. jc1199: We dropped 3 or 4 TRILLION on unnecessary wars, 1.4 trillion on ONE fighter jet program (F-35), A trillion (at least) on nuclear weapons, 220 million a pop on F-22 fighter jets(no one knows the end), 3 billion a pop on new Virginia class submarines (no one knows the end), and the list goes on and on and on. But we \"can't afford\" wasteful stuff like education and basic health care. How is it that small countries like Cuba, Ireland, and Iceland can afford these wasteful things like healthcare and education but the richest country in the world just can't seem to do it? honestdoc: Do you know who benefits from all that spending?  The defense contractors that supply and build the weapons.  They basically funded the elections to their favor...always has, always will.  Big oil companies restrict renewable and sustainable energy sources from going mainstream...always has... and you know.  I'm sorry but I'm numb to all the BS of US politics and wastefulness.  I don't have any answers.

    "title": "4 months of debilitating pain and it was just an undiscovered cavity",
    "dialogue": "KapokLeGrand: This story is frankly unbelievable but I lived through it. I began experiencing severe dental pain in early May. I visited a local dentist who took x-rays and informed me that I had peridontal disease and my 11 remaining molars had to be extracted. Thinking this was a bit extreme, I was visiting my GP in a week anyway so I asked him about that. He examined me and said that it was likely sinusitis pressing on the top roots so sent me for a CT scan and referred me to an otolaryngologist. The specialist found no signs of sinusitis so he referred me to an oral surgeon. This specialist examined me said there was no need for extractions and prescribed Lyrica. Note that by now I'm in my third month of excruciating, debilitating pain. I went back to my GP asking his opinion on \"just take Lyrica\" and he referred me to another oral surgeon. This one said that 37 and 46 had to be extracted and booked it for November! I visited another dentist who took photos with an oral camera and found that 47 had a huge and very visible cavity in it. Note that this is after 4 months of specialists poking around my skull and this is the first time anyone mentioned this. He referred me to a third oral surgeon who agreed and extracted 37, 46 and 47. The IV sedation had barely worn off when I realized I HAD NO MORE PAIN (other than what would be expected by the extractions), It's been a week since and the 4 month pain adventure is over. All it was was a single cavity!How can it be that all of these experts missed a huge and very obvious cavity as the source of the pain? I went through 4 months of Hades and spent several thousand dollars for what should have been a single quick fix and am absolutely flabbergasted! honestdoc: What location are you in?  Any licensed dentist would be able to diagnose the cavity. KapokLeGrand: I'm in British Columbia, Canada. And these are the original x-rays taken four months ago. These were seen by all of the professionals I listed. And no one mentioned anything about this until last week. As I said, it's hard to believe! honestdoc: I'm very surprised that your dentist and various oral surgeons did not detect that lesion on the x-ray when you pointed out that area has severe pain.  Medical physicians would not know how to interpret dental x-rays. KapokLeGrand: What is even worse is that the original dentist right after informing me that all my molars needed extraction called in the hygienist and had her do a full cleaning. Exactly why you would want to clean teeth that were going to come out is beyond me. The cavity in 47 was so large and clearly visible you could easily place a dental tool in it and move it around... and of course still no one ever mentioned anything about that tooth specifically. Nothing but a money grab with no concern whatsoever for the patient condition. Unfortunately in this province there is no Dental organization to complain to, so I have zero recourse. I am totally disgusted. honestdoc: I still don't understand.  Something is missing.  Canadian dentists are very capable like in the US.  Did the original dentist wanted to take the problem teeth out? KapokLeGrand: Yes, generally I have had very good luck with dentists in Canada but I guess my luck ran out with these folks. As I stated in the original post, the first dentist took those xrays and wanted to remove all 11 remaining molars. That's when I started seeking second opinions which turned into the 4 month nightmare. The very first time anyone mentioned anything about that huge comma-shaped cavity in 47 was about 10 days ago. It's crazy."

We recently brought back some water samples and they lab tested at 3.5ppmWe are leaving in a month to go back and would like to take our own fluoride tester so we can test numerous water sources and advise the villagers which is the best supply for drinking and cooking.There are a wide range of meters available but we are all public health employees and are self-funding so hoping someone can give us advice so we can make the best cost/benefit purchase.Here’s a few examples of meters available from $50 to $1,000.https://hannainst.com/hi729-fluoride-lr.htmlhttps://hannainst.com/fluoride-portable-meter-hi98402.htmlhttps://www.ebay.com/itm/Apera-WS10...429979?hash=item3f99739adb:g:kr0AAOSwLlJa0MmQCheers MattKW: I never knew that such portable units existed. All I can say is that I use a Hanna instrument for testing the mineral content of my water going into the autoclave, and it's always been excellent. Therefore, which Hanna to buy? Well the cheaper one seems to fit the bill and with less expensive consumables. I don't think I'd trust the Chinese device without the ability to \"test\" it against a Hanna. Techo NZ: Thanks, likewise I never knew such things existed and have never had any need to know, but we got the lab results yesterday and we are leaving in a few weeks so I’m on a vertical learning curve.One of the team is adding data to the National Oral Health Survey for Vanuatu so we feel this information could be of value. Some other feedback has been the need for using distilled water as a zero calibration, and the chances of getting distilled water is zero, unless we steam a billy.  Apparently accurate fluoride results are potentially ambient and sample temperature dependent, and calibration is needed at various points ??   I don’t know how much of this is correct, just mentioning it. MattKW: I haven't read fully into the Hanna instrument, but with the one we use, it comes with sachets of a calibrating liquid. Maybe you should talk to Hanna about your requirements in the field? Who knows, they might even be willing to donate for a worthy cause? Techo NZ: Which Hanna instrument do you use ? the links I provided had a $50 Hanna and a $500 Hanna.Are you testing for anything specific or just total dissolved salts (TDS) ?

No-one tells me nuffin'! HM digital don't have a fluoride tester in their range that I could see.\nYes, have a triple osmosis unit and we test for TDS once a month'usually needs changing once a year.. We used to have a resin-exchange filter for same reason, and would fill up 25L containers. That was tested at every refill, and we'd usually have to change that type of filter every 6 months. Techo NZ: Thanks, modern TDS meters are very good and a dime a dozen, we buy them for like $5 each, if a customer has an alert on their autoclave such as 'water quality unacceptable' I don't even send a technician to investigate, mostly it is just an early warning alert and they can keep using the autoclave until resolved, unless the reading is too high in which case modern autoclaves lock out until sorted.I just send them a TDS meter and with advice over the phone they can usually sort it themselves, the courier costs more than the meter and I don't even care if the meter never comes back.Accurately measuring fluoride levels seems to be another kettle of fish.... vertical learning.As a tech and not a dentist  (techs earn more $$ ha ha !) is an inter-generational reading of 3.5ppm for ground water something to be worried about ? With only a few weeks to go I'm pondering how much effort to put into researching the best meter and if it is the best use of our limited funds. MattKW: I've found a couple of articles  (EPA USA, NSW Health) for you that advise a naturally occurring source of 4ppm is the maximum. I've highlighted the relevant sections and numbered the pages on the opening page. So it seems like 3.5 is acceptable. Techo NZ: The EPA link had a maximum of 4.0ppm and the NSW had a maximum of 1.5ppm, quite a variation. MattKW: Techo NZ said:\t\t\tThe EPA link had a maximum of 4.0ppm and the NSW had a maximum of 1.5ppm, quite a variation.One of the team dentists messaged that the EPA link at 4.0 was 'Fake News' .?\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Sorry, \"fake news\"? I think they misunderstand what these reports mean. In Australia, there are very low levels of naturally occurring fluoride in the water supply, so it has to be supplemented UP to a max of 1.5. In the USA, some areas have well over this, and the aim is to bring DOWN the level to a maximum of 4ppm. At the bottom of page 12 of the NSW Health article, it talks briefly about high levels of fluoride found elsewhere in the world without skeletal fluorosis, although I'd infer that dental fluorosis is common. Techo NZ: Thanks, I've removed the fake news comment, over here we use it as light hearted humor rather than any offense.All good and very interesting, even to learn of skeletal and dental fluorosis. I'll leave fluoride to the dental team and won't look too much for some portable testing equipment at this point, not enough time and we'll likely be back in 4-6 months.... For now I'll stick to wires n sparks.  Appreciate your help. Cheers MattKW: Have a good trip."

    "title": "Enamel wearing away on teeth",
    "dialogue": "thisisme: Hi everyone, hope you are all well.I've noticed that my top front teeth on the back side have a serious amount of enamel worn away from them. This looks like something that has been deteriorating over several years but I have only just noticed.I'm 34 years of age. In reasonably good health. I generally stay away from soft drinks and food which is bad for my health although I don't eat perfectly. I do eat sugar, chocolate and some things which are considered bad for your health.I brush my teeth twice daily. I've had sensitive teeth ever since the age of about 10 years old. My parents took me to various dentists around that age in an attempt to try and diagnose the aching in my teeth. One dentist told me that I had sensitive teeth. It seemed to be correct. Every time I ate and eat fruit, drink anything mildly acidic I get tooth ache. After consuming these kind of products I have to immediately rinse my mouth with water and sometimes brush my teeth, otherwise I will suffer 2 weeks of pain in my teeth when eating other types of usually harmless food.So I've been careful with my teeth every since I was logical enough to do so. Probably around the age of 10 as mentioned above.I went to a dentist at the age of about 28. He told me that I had the best teeth he had ever seen for someone my age. However, he expressed concern. He said I appear to be brushing my teeth too hard and possibly grinding my teeth during my sleep. He gave me a guard to sleep with to prevent damage from grinding but I found it too hard to sleep with so couldn't use it.I recently purchased an electric toothbrush with a pressure censor to prevent myself from brushing too hard. It is at this time I have noticed the enamel wear on the back of my front top teeth.That is generally my oral history. What can I do to fix this problem and what kind of treatment should I take? Ideally, I'd like to stay away from anything too invasive etc. I would prefer to take a natural approach wherever possible. I would like to stay away from Veneers and Crowns, specifically for my front teeth to avoid problems during old age.I've been reading about processes to restore enamel. I've seen various products. Do they work? My research suggests that scientists are close to creating a process for the regeneration of enamel, however, we currently do not have it.So what treatments do you professionally recommend?Any help is greatly appreciated.Regards\nMartin MattKW: Those products only help to restrengthen weakened enamel, but do not replace enamel that has been lost. There is no real hope for regeneration of enamel in our lifetime; come back in another life! If a dentist says you have good enamel, and you minimise acidic foods and drinks, then all will be fine. thisisme: Thanks for the reply. But is there any kind of treatment to increase the life of the front teeth? Once the enamel has worn off what could the life expectancy of the teeth be?

    "dialogue": "allkidd: For the last 8 years I periodically get extreme teeth pain starting in my front upper or lower teeth. At first, the pain occurred infrequently and went away after taking Ibuprofen. The last few years the pain is more frequent and severe. Typically, this only occurs after I ride my mountain bike, and thus breath through my mouth, when the weather is cool. Oddly, the pain doesn't start until about a half hour after I'm out of the cool and have been in a warmer environment. The pain never occurs when I exercise in the warm summer. Many times I've been to my dentist about this issue and she says my teeth are in great shape and has no idea as to the cause. For this same problem, I've been to a periodontist, endodontist,  neurologist and ear nose and throat doctor.  They all say nothing is wrong. Desperate to try anything, I paid my dentist to make a couple mouthpieces, one for sleeping and the other for when I exercise. I've worn these for about a year without any difference in outcomes. Also, without any noticeable difference, I regularly use sensitive toothpaste and fluoride mouthwash. Recently, in researching my situation, I ran across an article on the movement of fluid within the dentinal tubules. The described symptoms are similar to what I'm experiencing. The problem is that this articles solution is different types of sensitive toothpaste which I've already tried without success. At this point I don't know what else to try. I do have and appointment with a TMJ dentist in about a month but I don't seem to have many of the same symptoms of jaw issues. Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated! honestdoc: Hopefully the ear nose & throat specialist eliminated the sinuses as a source for pain.  Do you have pain bending forward and walking up & downstairs? Have you worn your mouthpiece when you mountain bike?  Do you notice similar pain?Do you whiten your teeth?  Many times after whitening, it makes the teeth more sensitive.   I'm sorry but based on the information given, I'm only able to guess. allkidd: honestdoc, Yes, ENT said sinuses in good shape and not cause of problem. No pain when I bend over. I do wear mouthpiece when ride but hasn't seemed to make a difference. Never have whitened my teeth. honestdoc: There is an Orofacial Pain Center at the University of Kentucky Lexington that specializes in unknown dental pain.  The director is Dr. Jeffrey Okeson.  I have his textbooks and attended his numerous lectures.  I'm not sure if it is worth your visit. allkidd: Thanks for the suggestion. I've already spend a lot of money and would definitely consider going to him. I've got an appointment scheduled with a new dentist and an appointment with a TMJ dentist. If neither of these seem to have a solution then I will look into the Kentucky dentist clinic. lolzita: allkidd said:\t\t\tAt this point I don't know what else to try.

    "title": "Problem with pressure/numbness in front teeth....help?",
    "dialogue": "SC1991: A few months ago, I noticed pressure in my front teeth top and bottom, as if they were being forced together. It would alleviate temporarily when I pressed my tongue against them or flossed but would return. I thought it was due to sinus trouble and didn’t mention it to my dentist. The feeling has returned, driving me mad. My teeth feel under constant pressure, and they start to feel numb without relief. One top front tooth hurts when biting down. I haven’t been to the dentist for 7-8 years due to anxiety but recently started seeing one. The dentist didn’t find anything wrong with my front teeth, and I need fillings and a hygienist session. My teeth usually feel fine in the morning but the pressure starts later in the day. I wonder if I’m subconsciously pushing my tongue against my teeth. I’m brushing, flossing more, and avoiding sugary foods. I’m worried about needing implants or dentures, which I can't afford or handle. Any advice? lolzita: I’ve had the same issue for 5-7 years. I need to floss immediately after eating or the pressure builds up and lasts for days or weeks. I thought it was due to crowding from my wisdom teeth. I removed all 4 wisdom teeth, but the pressure hasn’t subsided. Considering orthodontics to uncrowd the teeth. Any advice? John Roberts: I have similar symptoms with the front four top teeth being the worst. It’s been ongoing since 2016. I’ve seen various dentists who found nothing wrong, though one tooth has a slight crack and others have crowns and root canals. The pain isn’t from hot or cold but pressure and tapping. I had a sleep study for teeth grinding (none found) and a night guard that’s too tight. I’m still trying to figure out the cause. Busybee: Try consciously relaxing your jaw during the day so your teeth don’t touch when not eating. Stress might be causing clenching. It’s ideal to avoid unnecessary dental work and focus on changing habits and relaxation techniques. John Roberts: I don’t clench hard now, but the pressure and pain persist. I had fluoride treatment before this started, and some suspect it might be related, though dentists disagree. I’m exploring other causes. Y2K_o__o: I have similar issues since May. Clenching caused molars to wear down, affecting my front teeth. Grinding was alleviated by adjusting molars but pressure remains. Considering nerve issues. Sue66: My front teeth have a tight feeling and pressure, possibly related to sinus issues. Flossing and using interdental brushes haven’t helped. Any advice? Robert Bailey: Do you push your teeth with your tongue? My teeth feel better in the morning, but pressure returns during the day. I’ll see an orthodontist soon. John Roberts: I’ve been diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia, causing pain and numbness in my teeth. A neurologist confirmed this, and I’m on medication with an MRI scheduled. I feel somewhat better knowing the cause. Y2K_o__o: My dentist diagnosed malocclusion due to clenching and adjusted my bite. The discomfort decreased but persists. I’ve changed my diet, hoping for further relief."

    "dialogue": "W1991: Hello,2 months ago i had really bad pain on my left side first molar and also could feel a hard lump under it and if i pressed on the tooth it hurt. I took pain killers for 3-4 days and the pain went and i ignored it for 2 more weeks before going to see to dentist.He done an x-ray and there was indeed an infection and was told i would need root canal or an extraction. The tooth in question has gave me trouble before and 7 years ago it had quite a big filling done to it as it was really decayed. You can't see the lump you can only feel it, its hard but doesn't move.Done 2 course's of antibiotics ( amoxicillin & Metronidazole ) but the lump is still there but the swelling went down slightly and was told to come back in 2 weeks.My questions are can i still have root canal done if the lump doesn't go?\nIf i do have to have an extraction could the second molar move into its place to let the wisdom tooth behind it come through? \nCould it be more serous than just an abscess? Thanks! MattKW: You shouldn't be going through courses of antibiotics and hoping the lump will go away. You should either get it extracted or start the RCT ASAP. An analogy: if you had a splinter in your skin that was causing infection, do you take antibiotics or deal with the splinter? Don't delay any longer - if this dentist wants the swelling to go down, then go somewhere else.\nIf you take out this molar, the wisdom tooth may move forward, but it will tilt over and be fairly useless. They often have to be extracted anyway. W1991: Could i not use braces to stop it from tilting? what do you suggest?  RCT? he did say extraction is last resort as you should always try to save the tooth if you canI really don't want to have an implant or bridges... id rather leave the gap if i could do so without problems. honestdoc: After tooth extraction, the back teeth (2nd molar and wisdom tooth if space is available) tends to shift forward (towards the midline) and the opposing teeth tends to erupt up.  As Dr. MattKw mentioned, the back molar will tilt forward because of the crown shifts more than roots. You don't have to have an implant or bridge. Many times (not always) the teeth shifting will stabilize the opposing teeth and the bite will also stabilize. W1991: Thank you both for your replies. Do you think I should try the root canal first even if it could fail? I’m from the UK and it will cost me around £400.  All my other teeth are fine no fillings yet! honestdoc: I would go to a root canal specialist (endodontist) who uses a dental microscope. This tooth is very complicated and has very high failure rates.  Very common canal most dentist miss is the 2nd Mesial Buccal."

    "dialogue": "Cristina Montenegro: Hi all,First of all thanks to anyone that can provide me with some help.I got my right lower second molar removed in April. My original plan was to put a tooth implant after the healing of the wound, but now I realized that I can bite properly in that side of the mouth and the gap cannot be seen, unless I open my mouth a lot, so as far as I know, the loss of the tooth is not causing me any problem. My questions is, what are the consequences of not putting an implant and leave the gap as it is? Could this cause any harm to other teeth? I don’t want that this can cause the loss of more teeth in the future, but I also don’t want to implant a piece of metal in my mouth unless is really necessary.Thanks for your help! honestdoc: Unless you are in Class 2 molar Angle's malocclusion, the upper 2nd molar is left unopposed if it is present.  The unopposed molar will continue to erupt down until opposed (gums?)  This takes years to happen.  If you don't have the upper 2nd molar, you don't need an implant at that location.In my opinion, it is harder to place an implant further in the future due to further flattening of the bone.  An option is to wait until the hyper-erupting molar causes a problem and extract it. Where I practice, not everyone can afford an implant so this option seems to be the most followed."

It's not the chlorine itself that's the problem, it's the acidic compounds it forms and should be counterbalanced by other chemicals to achieve a neutral H of 7-7.4.\nGet a sample of the water and have it tested at a pool shop. I'd be interested to hear the results. If it's a public pool, then bring it to their attention.\nFor the sensitivity, get some desensitising toothpaste."

I went to the dentist the other day and it had ruined the molar in front of them also. I’m going to have them removed as soon as possible but had anyone ever heard of teeth causing such a problem as this? Even my dentist couldn’t answer this for me he didn’t know.

They bleed when I brush them and are very painful.  I am very frightened of the dentist but realise that I have to do something very quick before they fall out!  If I have to have them all removed and have dentures do they put you to sleep to do this as I don't think I could handle being awake and also do they fit the dentures at the same time.

    "dialogue": "Zaia: I don't know if I'm posting this in the right place but I have been reading about the possibility of using stem cells to regrow teeth. Could this eventually replace dental implants? Could it be done if a tooth has been missing for years? How far into the future is this? At this point, it seems too good to be true.. honestdoc: There was a discussion that they are developing embryonic stem cells from the rat's bladder to form a tooth bud.  Unfortunately not much else was discussed. MattKW: One of the problems are that teeth grow in a very unusual manner compared to other tissue. I've heard of some amorphous blobs being generated, but they'll be growing livers, hearts, etc well before they manage teeth. And there has to be a big cost benefit for the company which is more likely with liver, heart, etc...  So my career is not over just yet."

    "dialogue": "Mr_m_cox: Hi all, My first post here so hi to all the regulars!A few days ago, while eating, I felt an odd bit of flesh I my mouth. Upon inspection I was a small round lump on my lower gum right on the site of a year's old extraction and next to a tooth that has had lots of reconstruction.I gave it a prod and a poke and found that, with a little tear it came off! It was a small sack of skin with a fatty/fleshy inside. What was left was a small round patch of red which bled lightly for a few mins and then stopped.There as no pain at any point and no other issues to note. Anyone have any ideas what it could be and if I should be worried? My first, and probably over the top reaction, was cancer so now I am super stressed but can find nothing like it online.Any input would be amazing and yes, I will get to a dentist, but any reassurance in the meantime would certainly help me sleep.Thanks all. honestdoc: It is hard to guess without images.  My best guess is possible bone \"spur\" we call sequestrum which is a dead piece of bone the body is trying to exfoliate.  It is very rare (~3% according to the average of numerous sources) to get cancer in the mouth from just noticing a bump.  The only way to diagnose cancer is to take a sample and look at it under a microscope (biopsy). Mr_m_cox: honestdoc said:\t\t\tIt is hard to guess without images.

It is soft, no hard bone to speak of but it sounds very possible its that as behind where it was is hard tooth or boneHaving checked again there is no sign of it but I guess if it is that it will return as the bone is still pushing, correct?Do I need to treat if we assume it is that or will my body work its magic? honestdoc: Usually the mouth heals very quickly and any pieces of dead bone will exfoliate naturally or if deep internally, become resorbed.  Keep up with all your dental visits to minimize concerning surprises."

    "dialogue": "thelilyfield: So I posted a question about a faulty bridge, and went and got a second opinion.  The second dentist was looking at my previous bill and said he saw a ton of red flags and I'm curious if he's right.During my very first visit to the initial dentist:\n1. I was charged for root planing/scaling, for all four quadrants, on the same day.  Second dentist says my bone is too healthy for that procedure.  Is root planing not possible for some patients?2. Is it possible to do root planing/scaling on the same day that I had a bridge put in?  3. How long does root planing/scaling take?  I was at the dentist for about 4 hours total on that day.  According to my bill I had pics and xrays taken, a cleaning done, laser treatment, antibact something done, a partial tooth extracted, a bone graft done, two teeth prepped to support the bridge, and a temporary bridge placed.  The only section of my mouth that I remember being numbed was the bridge section.  My gums were sore the next couple days, but not sure if laser can do that also.  Does that sound like reasonable work or suspicious?  I also called insurance to ask questions and they were never billed for the work I had done, which definitely sounds suspicious.  Just trying to get answers and feedback before I submit a claim.  Thanks. honestdoc: I'm sorry but it appears like your first dentist was production hungry and he or she is over-treating you. There are many reasons why the first dentist has all that time to produce \"work\" on you for your first visit.  That dentist may have scared away many patients."

    "title": "Overcharged to re-cement crown after root canal?",
    "dialogue": "Caslontooth: My back molar crown came loose during a cleaning.  It was determined I needed a root canal. Afterwards the existing crown was reattached. There was a little build-up needed so the crown would sit correctly. I was shocked to have been charged $595 for this. Convince me not to choose another dentist. MattKW: I'm surprised that managed to retro-fit the old crown after the RCT. The fact that the crown came loose in the first place, and then they determined that you needed an RCT suggests that there was a significant amount of decay and tooth destruction underneath. In most cases you have to make a whole new crown, so maybe it was more a case of \"should've quoted more clearly\" rather than a rip-off. Caslontooth: Not sure why the crown came loose in the first place, I have a strong bite tho. Also the Endodontist  might have changed the top of the tooth while doing some drilling for the root canal.  Anyways, it took my regular dentist about an hour to build up the surface a little and cement it on. I'm glad she did what was necessary for a long lasting re-cementing of the crown (took ex-ray before final cementing to make sure).  Cement and some build up material and ex-ray and one hours work simply doesn't equate to just under $600.00 in my book. I'm not saying rip-off, I'm saying this dentist has priced me out of continuing with her as my primary dentist after 4 years.  I'll bet my bottom dollar I could have had the same care for at least $200 less. MattKW: It's unfortunate you feel this way. I think $600 to attempt and achieve something of this degree of difficulty is reasonable, when most dentists (myself included) might well have advised whole new crown at a higher cost. Caslontooth: MattKW said:\t\t\tIt's unfortunate you feel this way. I think $600 to attempt and achieve something of this degree of difficulty is reasonable, when most dentists (myself included) might well have advised whole new crown at a higher cost.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\n I should have had the endodonist temp glue the crown on, then made an appointment for the next day or two to come in where I could then ask about the cost. She fit me in spur of the moment.  However, it was she who told me to have the endodonist give her 30 minutes head start and I could come right over, which I did. I wasn't in any particular rush to have the crown cemented on.  I was almost made to feel that it was no big deal to have the crown cemented back on, which is why weeks before she just needed 30 minute prior notice.  I agree with you that the chances of the crown fitting back on perfectly isn't a given. Nor is it a given that it was merely the cement that gave up in the first place. It could have gotten mobility because of decay, like you said.Anyways, maybe I'll stay with her as my dentist, now that you replied.  I have to say, it was a real shock cost wise. Also, there's no telling how long her minor tooth build up job will last. She didn't prep me about how the crown might not fit back on perfectly. She made it seem like it was no big deal.  $600 is a big deal.Edit:  When getting my teeth cleaned the hygentist alerted the Dr. of \"mobility\"  of the crown. She (the dentist) was able to pop it off rather easily.  After reading your reply, I suddenly see that mobility of a crown is not a good thing. No, it's not just the cement giving up. I knew that  afterwards  by reasonable thinking.  Then again, what's best for the patient,  the patient doesn't always want to hear, cost wise.  One last thing in hindsight, I still should have let the endodontist temp cement the crown on. That way I wouldn't be crashing her busy day, which she just happen to be having, lol.  She made it seem I had a good chance of re-using the crown tho, when having my teeth cleaned.  I wish she wasn't so rushed that day. I bet you I could have asked for a lesser price.  She took a few ex-rays before the final cement. Very thorough."

    "title": "Crown Question",
    "dialogue": "fandabby: HiMy dentist discovered I had a craze line on lower molar towards end of last year (had a fractured tooth opposite side same tooth discovered eventually earlier that year - long story resulted in infection wouldn't clear, root canal attempt wouldn't clear and then it cracked through another attempt when clearing the canals, so tooth extracted, resulted in a lot of bone loss).  Now with that history I asked if this tooth could be crowned now due to previous experience, was told no wait and see craze lines are common.8 weeks later back to dentist with that tooth tender and earache and insisted on xray - confirmed early stages of infection. I pushed for a crown to protect tooth.\nAntibiotics cleared infection then was booked in for crown. 1st visit no infection present so tooth was prepared, filed down and shaped, visible crack across tooth so was told this was the best option.  Took impression and said I could go and rebook for 2 weeks.  I asked was I not getting a temporary cover to protect tooth and was told no, it's in a better position now as the tooth sits lower than other teeth so won't get knocked it'll be fine. Was told to be careful and eat soft food nothing too hot or cold on opposite side.Had crown fitted 2 weeks later.  Had to polish off upper teeth to accommodate the bite.  This in itself has left upper teeth feeling weird and sometimes achey.Anyway have had trouble on and off with crowned tooth being sore and one point loose.  Went back several times to check the crown and was told it can take up to 6 months to settle.  When it became lose went to an emergency clinic as couldn't see my dentist and xray showed nothing.  It settled and became solid again.  Waves of ok no pain no problems to not ok during this periodHad a mouth guard made 3 weeks after crown to protect from clenching.At 6 month point I had a lump appear side of gum of crowned tooth. Went back and dentist said likely the mouth guard rubbing doesn't see it looking like infection. (prior to all of this my teeth were in perfect shape, no fillings, cavities, decay etc.  It was a bout of high levels of stress and grinding teeth which caused the cracks in teeth).  Guard checked and said yeap there is the rubbing and cut it to shape.  I asked for xray and had one but dentist felt it unnecessary. Xray showed advanced infection.  Two rounds of Antiobiotics did not clear, told root canal won't work so extracted tooth.Question, I was infection free before crown prep, the procedure for crown, should a temp cap/cover be fitted as standard to protect tooth, especially knowing my history with other tooth and there was a visible crack across the tooth when he wore it down?  I did question couple times at the time are you sure and dentist convinced me I would be fine.  Not being a dentist and unfamiliar with procedures accepted what i was being told.\nIs it likely that the bacteria got in whilst exposed for those 2 weeks and caused this infection which has now results in this loss?Not particularly happy as thought crown would prevent infections and further damage.Based in UK.Thanks MattKW: \" 8 weeks later back to dentist with that tooth tender and earache and insisted on xray - confirmed early stages of infection. I pushed for a crown to protect tooth. Antibiotics cleared infection then was booked in for crown.\"\nIf you had infection at that stage, then that's when the RCT should've been done (or an extraction). It doesn't make sense to take antibiotics to settle the infection (they didn't clear it), then progress to crown. The fact that you could go without a temp crown but no pain shows that the tooth was probably dead and infected already. fandabby: Thanks for replyAntibiotics for 5 days following extraction and going back because still badly infected.I feel this could have all been avoided if the tooth was crowned when I asked last year. MattKW: Maybe, maybe not. A crown preparation can cause nerve death in 5-10% of cases anyway. On one patient, I had all 3 teeth die after crown preparations, and I was being as conservative as possible. That could also have happened to you. The dentist is also to be judged by their peers, not by the patients. So if he had done a crown for a tooth that didn't show a clear need, he could be criticised by the dental authorities for any adverse consequences. I would probably not have done a crown for you either. You are unlucky, and sometimes s*** happens to both patient and dentist."

There's no pain right now but I was concerned about how the crown looked kind of jagged on the xray, and I regret not bringing it up with the dentist. The shape of the crown is also way too smooth and round, not ridged like a natural tooth. Do you all see any potential issues?Image album of xrays (all of the same tooth): https://imgur.com/a/FOEFKSB MattKW: It appears that the dentist has placed the crown only 1/2 way down each side, so it finishes on a filling on the left side (as you look at the X-ray), and just beyond the contact point on right side. Usually we'd want to take it down all the way to the gum margin, but sometimes you have to compromise. So it could be better, but it's not terrible. The most important thing is that it's cleansable, and that you can easily floss both sides without tearing the floss. Should be OK from the limited images you show here."

So glad I stumbled upon it\nI need to make a decision and need help and advice to best decide as I don’t know who to trust\nWell here is it\nI have four quite argue amalgam fillings in my molar teeth . Been there for many years\nI’m 57\nDon’t remember having them\nSo could have been like 45 years ago\nAnyway I have a frien in Holland who has hers replace with white composite to get rid of the mercury as she’s a Holistic person\nHer husband did hers for free\nBut here’s the thing\nI have got a crack in my upper filling which at times I feel great sensitivity in\nWhen food gets in it\nSo my dentist has told me the best option is s crown\nI don’t know if that is the best way to go\nAs I’ve read that sometimes they cause more trouble to the filled tooth?\nSo my first question is \nIs I easier to drill out and simply refill tooth with a safer substance? And if so , will it hurt and is it toxic to do so?\nAnd is it as hard wearing as amalgam?\nSecond question is . Is it easier to get a crown?\nSave the filling already in there?If he fills it it won’t need s crown will it?\nHow big a job is it\nAnd are they different ways it can be  crowned or just the one?\nAlso  he said it’s 400 for porcelains n crown\nAnd free for cobalt chromium\nBut I’m not bothered about appearance as it’s not seen\nBut I’m worried about what they use\nAnd if it will cause me problems later in\nOr make things worseHe also told me he could if I want have all my amalgams out and newer stuff put in\nAlthough I tend to believe that if it isn’t broke then we shouldn’t fix it\nI wonder if it’s worth it\nCan anyone help please\nAs I have been pondering for too long now\nThankyou\nI have anxiety bad too\nThankyouThis is a picture of just the filing with the crack in that he suggested caping MattKW: You would benefit from a crown on that tooth. The filling might have to be replaced first for a sound foundation. Personally, I'd do a pinned amalgam. Composite offers no advantage, except it's easier for the dentist.\nAmalgam is not toxic. Holistic dentists are unscientific, and they make a nice living out of scaring people.Crowns come in many different materials. You could do nearly anything. Never heard of chrome cobalt crowns, but I suppose it's possible. I would suggest either ceramic (eMax) or a high precious metal (yellow or white gold). High precious will cost you $, but very nice material.\nWhy would you take out fillings that have been working so well and replace them with composite? I agree, \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\". I have a few amalgams that have been in place for 40years; composites aren't that durable. honestdoc: I favor the glassionomer core filling.  It bonds naturally to tooth structure and doesn't stress like amalgam.  Too often I seen amalgams intact while the tooth is fractured off.  Amalgam fillings can last a lifetime if it is kept small.  I also like zirconia crowns.  They are very durable since they are \"fake diamonds.\"  High precious metal crowns have more accurate margins against the tooth.  If costs are a concern, consider less precious (less amount of gold) metal crowns. mandymoore: Do not have your amalgam fillings replaced. As far as I understand it, removing them releases the unhealthy toxins. Amalgam fillings last forever. The white ones do not. Every time your tooth needs a new filling or you're told it needs one, the dentist will drill a bigger hole. Now you're guaranteed, and so is your dentist by the way, that you need more dental work later on and eventually a crown. Once you have a crown, your gum line above the crown will recede, your jaw bone will lose mass in some years (depending on your age) and now you need an implant. I have crowns but they were placed by the rare perfectionist (it took him an hour per crown when placing) in Holland in the days when making money was not the main goal of dentistry in a non-US country. I have had the crowns for 30 years. Two US dentists wanted to either pull them out or replace them. The first one uttered that suggestion 20 years ago. She also told me that all my filling were cracked and needed replacement and wasn't it nice that my insurance would cover most of the cost? I didn't trust her and consulted a dentist in Holland who said it was \"bogus\" in a nice way. After all he was talking about a colleague. In general you really only want the necessary dental work done. Because dental work on a tooth creates more dental work later on, leading to a most often ill placed crown which leads to receding gum lines in about 5 to 10 years depending on your age, loss of jaw bone above the crown because which dentist is going to take the time to properly set the crown? And now you need a costly implant ...People in third world countries often seem to have perfect teeth. I think our poor diets aka processed foods have a lot to do with getting cavities. IMHO the amalgam fillings last a life time, why sign up for bigger holes and more dental work that wasn't needed to begin with? If it ain't broke don't fix it."

I know the Nomad Pro 2 at $6k is very good but out of budget. \nThere are a lot of Internet listings for items like MyRay, MaxRay etc which fit the budget, and I know cheap and good in the same sentence is an oxymoron, hence why I'd appreciate any feedback if you have used anything. honestdoc: Sorry, I have no experience with your inquiries.  I want to thank you for your time and efforts with volunteering. Techo NZ: Well thank you, we are a team of 6 from New Zealand who make 2 or sometimes 3 trips a year to the most remote Islands. Most work for the NZ public health service and give up their annual leave time and largely pay their own way, airfares, food, travel costs.The last trip was to the island of Loh, one of the most northern and ‘forgotten Islands’ of the Torres group with the only dirt landing strip. From Vila it is 3 hours low and slow flying in a very noisy 1968 Britten Islander, the pilot said if oil was leaking from the engine that was good, it meant there was still some oil left, but to let him know if the oil stopped leaking as that meant there was no more oil They have never received oral health care before so when word gets out the dental team have arrived people walk for hours. Lots of RoP, extractions and infection issues to deal with. Techo NZ: Just prior to our first arrival there had been a fatal case of Ludwigs Angina.....Tragically it was a Nivan health worker, the one they relied on the most for their well being. Due to their remoteness and inability for diagnosis or evacuation for treatment the prolonged suffering and trauma continues to haunt the island. Techo NZ: Here is a link to the web site for our volunteer group,we are non religious, non political, non governmental, just a small bunch for kiwis who have a great time going to these remote and wonderful places. Being small and self funding we go where we like, when we like and do what is best without beholding to anyone. Nonetheless I must give a shout out to Rotary who help support us on some of the most remote trips.Personally I'm the electrician and a friend of the dental team, I go along to try and get some sort of power going from either the local solar or busted generators to power the dental equipment, then I'm the DA... Fuji 9 anyone ??We take 2 suitcase dental sets, 2 dentists work side by side with a a patient each but due to power restrictions you can only use 1 set at any one moment, so they have to tag-team trying to use one triple syringe on one set, then pause whilst the other drills on the other set, then pause whilst one suctions (max 20 seconds before it overloads), then pause whilst one uses slow speed... then pause again as everything overloads, wait for it to reset and go again, 2 weeks 300 interventions... the power sux but if ya don't laugh you'd cry The 2nd video under the Torres Island Oral Health Project link shows a STOL plane that gets us to some of the bigger islands, it's bigger than the 8 seater Britten Islander going to Torres, interestingly after we landed in the STOL the bent fuel cap fell off, the pilot is trying to put it back on ha hahttps://afriendofkokorosa.org/ Techo NZ: In regards to needing a portable X-Ray, we installed a 1980's wall mounted X-Ray and for 3 years it worked well, it must've taken 1,000+ exposures but due to power surges it died 4 days into a 2 week trip, Trying to treat 300+ people with no X-ray is hard. So we are looking to get a portable jobby to take between the islands. Next trip is August (in 6 weeks), we probably need to sort something within the next 2 weeks so any experience or recommendations appreciated. Cheers Techo NZ: We settled on a RayMe portable X-Ray from Korea, it was US $1,200 or NZ $1,800 , it's $800 over budget, but oh well we'll find the money somewhere. \nOrdered it on Friday, it was on the doorstep the next Thursday, wow 6 days from China to NZ, that's amazing. The team leaves for Loh Island in 2 weeks.https://www.adae.store/products/korean-made-portable-x-ray-machineI had a query to the supplier on the import duty, their reply was  \" don't worry dear, we make custom value look like low price, so now you can defraud tax \"\nIt goes in our Volunteer accounts at full price so we do end up paying the tax due but I laughed at \" look like low price... to defraud tax \" Techo NZ: The good news....\nThe X-Ray works very well, attached are some images. I used a 20mm fuse as a tester, it has a coil of wire inside the fuse to give depth, an interesting aspect is the coil at the very top of the fuse which is under a metal end cap. Slightly different time settings give slightly different depth and clarity Techo NZ: Here are some 'test dummy'  X-Rays... They may not be perfect as they were just tests and may need a bit of fine tuning, but good enough for a first result.Patient dental diagnoses are welcome... Techo NZ: The not so good news...\nOn arrival the internal battery was flat (which is to be expected) but the supplied battery charger was dead... zero, ziltch, nada, nothing... so the battery could not be charged.\nThe X-Ray has an internal Lithium Polymer battery, which requires constant voltage, constant current charging.  The sort of battery that if you charge it with the wrong charger then they die or explode, so it needed the exact charger to match the exact internal battery.The team were leaving in 2 weeks and the Chinese supplier wanted the faulty charger back before supplying a replacement.Further the original charger was marked to indicate the charging plug was wired as centre negative, (99% of chargers are centre positive, but 1 in 100 are centre negative), but with the charger not working there was no way to prove or disprove this . So after a few days sourcing a new local charger and connecting it as centre negative then both the new charger and the X-ray emitted smoke... Feck.. the X-Ray battery was really centre positive, the label on the supplied charger was clearly wrong.Long story short.. pull the x-ray apart, fix it, put it together.. new charger, we got it going... but could've done without the hassle. Techo NZ: And for a dental team update... they were due to leave in a few days but a volcanic eruption has closed the airspace to Loh Island. The pilot felt he could detour around the ash cloud but would then have to wait 3 weeks on Loh for fuel to come by boat to make the return journey.\nThe team are now re-routing to Aneityum ,the southern most island of Vanuatu. The first leg of the journey to Aneityum is via Tanna Island which is (or was) on the ATR-72-500 that crashed at Port Vila last week, smoke in the cockpit, emergency landing and hit 2 planes on landing, nil injuries, but the plane is out of action, so maybe that is now a new problem.The smashed Britten Islander in the background is the one we flew to Loh in December last year.1968 - 2018 R.I.Phttps://www.radionz.co.nz/internati...ne-makes-emergency-landing-at-vanuatu-airportIf any of you have been on a P&O cruise that stopped at Mystery Island, it is the villagers of Aneityum who boat across to operate the tours.Another trip to Aneityum is planned for October, I'll be there.. ask the locals to bring you ashore"

    "dialogue": "ruler1: Both my upper second premolars have been missing since birth.I was wearing Invisalign to keep the gaps open for future implants, as well as rubber bands connecting my upper first molars to my lower canines to correct an underbite, but the retainers haven't been fitting snugly.Recently, I've been having chewing pain in my upper jaw on the right side, and when I checked in the mirror, I noticed that my first molar was leaning inward toward my first premolar, resulting in a mild slant that decreased the gap size. I stopped wearing my rubber bands because I worried that they were the cause for the lean (since they were pulling on the tooth, but the tooth wasn't well connected with the rest of my teeth since the Invisalign didn't fit well). I was wondering if this was the reason for my chewing pain and whether it's a cause of concern. (Personally I'm thinking chewing is putting pressure on the teeth to lean even more and potentially unsocket)I haven't been able to visit my dentist or orthodontist because I've been dealing with anxiety and auditory hallucinations. Thanks in advance for any input. Busybee: You will need to go to the orthodontist, trying to fix it yourself isn't an option because your bite sounds complex.   Are you in your teens?Auditory hallucinations must be very frightening.  You should be on medication.  Have you seen a doctor about this?"

    "title": "X-ray machine and too many x rays",
    "dialogue": "tprudden: I just moved and have transferred to a new dentist. On my first visit they told me they would require x rays, fine. they started the X rays and after a few I asked, how many are you going to do? the technician said 18!! I was a little taken aback and thought, wow, that's seems like a lot of X rays. After she was finished with the 18 x-rays I started looking at the equipment. The x-rays were the modern, digital type that display on a monitor immediately upon taking them but, the actual machine that provides the beam of radiation looked a little dated. While the tech was out of the room, I glanced over at the machine and looked at the name plate: it said General Electric model 47-137200G2, and was dated 1978. I thought, 1978! that's 40 years old.my mind started wandering and I couldn't get the thought out of my mind, 40 years, surely X-ray equipment has greatly improved in the last 40 years? Also, I'm thinking, the dose of radiation from that machine, vs what is produced in a more modern version, surely is has to be greater or more scattered or something. I don't know, maybe these older machines are updated or something to fall in line with current standards? Or, maybe the standards are the same?Is this a cause for concern or is this very common and not an issue? I'm not one to get too overly concerned about this kind of stuff but, lets just say I'm no stranger to dental X-rays, I've had my share of cavities and other dental work over the years. I'm in my early 50's.Thanks in advance for any input? Techo NZ: I test and validate dental X-Rays including OPG’s. Contrary to popular thinking dental X-Rays are incredibly safe, 4 dental X Rays is the equivalent to the radiation you receive after 2 hours of flying. A pilot, or flight crew who clock up 1,000 hours of flying time per year (a mere 20 hours a week) receives as much radiation as 2,000 dental X-Rays per year, or 5.5 x rays per day 365 days a year. Do you see many pilots with 6 toes or wearing lead aprons when flying ?There is absolutely no epidemiological evidence the X-Rays are unsafe,  zilch, zero, nada, none, nothing. Were it not for the the Linear No Threshold Hypothesis (LNT) all x-rays, whether dental, medical or surgical would be deemed incredibly safe. The only thing that deems X-Rays ‘unsafe’ is the LNT hypothesis, noting that a hypothesis is an idea which is suggested as a possible explanation for a particular situation or condition, but which has not yet been proved to be correct.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_no-threshold_modelI have read the UN report on Chernobyl, only 40 people died as a direct result of radioactive exposure, almost all of them were the chopper crews who flew into radiation clouds dumping concrete on the sarcophagus. Everything else that happened at Chernobyl was a media frenzy and political scam. Never mind that the other 2 reactors that were only 100m from the exploded reactor, remained in service, fully staffed for 25 years after the event. Far more people died as a result of iodised salt poisoning.In regards to an old X-Ray versus the newer digital X-Rays… The only thing that now makes X-Rays digital is the reading and processing of the X-Ray (once it has been taken). The technical aspects of the actual X-Ray generator (the piece they stick by your head) is as old as the hills, even new improved X-Ray heads are as much about marketing hype then actual performance.We are required to validate X-rays and then apply a test label stating it complies, although rules vary from country to country. So if your X-ray has a valid test label then it should be fine, and even if it doesn’t, and even if it were giving 10 times the radiation dose, then unless the dentist wears 6 finger gloves, then personally I wouldn’t worry, you’ll get more radiation from 5 hours flying then from 18 X-Rays. Techo NZ: And to clarify… if you were to receive 2-10 times the required dose, then the X-Ray film (in your mouth) is also receiving 2-10 times the dose and it would be vastly over exposed and completely unreadable.So any dental X-Ray film that is readable has by reverse logic simply received the require exposure dose, no more, no less."

He wasn't able to do an x-ray for obvious reasons but when he looked at my tooth, he said it needs to be extracted. I asked him if he was sure and he said yes. Should I take his word for it if he didn't do an x-ray? I have an appointment in two weeks and he will look at it then once the swelling goes down and we will proceed from there. honestdoc: Have your dentist take an x-ray when your swelling goes down and discuss treatment options.  Your dentist will never extract teeth without a x-ray. Zaia: Ok thanks! I have another question. I know I'm jumping ahead here bit would it be possible to get braces or invisalign to bridge the gap left by the tooth if it needs to be extracted? It's a back molar. Behind it, I have another molar and a wisdom tooth honestdoc: It is really hard to close a molar gap and even harder if you are older than 25 years due to the density and hardness of your bone.  With that being said, I've encountered numerous cases when children lose their 6 year first molars to cavities, etc., and their 12 year 2nd molars erupt in their place.

If I brush normally on the area it starts bleeding; once it completely just gushed but it always stops after a few seconds of rinsing with water. I've heard of periodontal pockets, but aren't those typically referring the gum on the teeth? Like directly attached to them? Do I have something stuck between my teeth? Early gingivitis? Do I need to tell my dentist ASAP or will it go away if I don't irritate it further? I've heard from another forum that brushing normally and making it bleed also means that the built up bacteria is being released, is this true or should I avoid brushing harshly on the area? WHAT DO I DO SORTA FREAKING OUT. HangryPancake: I forgot to mention that I currently am wearing molar rings, and I feel like my bite has slightly changed because of them? I don't know if this changes anything, just mentioning it. Very soon, probably next week, I'm scheduled to get my braces on (I'm 15). If I have to treat this, will I have to wait to get braces? Will there be a lot of extra charges? I really hope I can sort this out before I go to the dentist, please help! honestdoc: Most likely you may be experiencing hormone fluctuations which can present in the gums as mild to moderate inflammation.  The only way to rule out gum disease is by your dentist.  The molar ortho bands do irritate the gums and shift your bite a bit.  Make sure you followup with your orthodontist.I would clean the area with gentle and thorough brushing and flossing.  Make sure it is not gum disease and if so, get proper dental cleaning and home hygiene. HangryPancake: Thank you! Guess I'll have to break it to my dentist lol. Gonna be a little upset hehe.

When I discovered the lump my dentist still wanted to crown it. It has now been just under 1 year with this lump. I have no pain. My dentist said it wasn't an Abscess but now she saying it is. I have had no antibiotics. She said my only options are have a specialist try and do the root canal treatment again which will cost around £600 or have it extracted. I don't want to loose the tooth but im not sure the re-root canal is 100% fix. I have never had an extraction before so don't know what to expect if I do go down that route. Surely eating without a Molar is going to be an issue? not to mention the actual procedure itself. I do have a dental fear so I am scared, I just don't know what to do as an extraction I guess is the worse possible outcome. Can I just leave it? im not in pain, the only reason I know I have an abscess is because of the lump I can feel with my finger. I can chew as normal. MattKW: You should go to the endodontist and at least get their assessment of the situation. It's just the cost of a consultation with Xray. Let them guide you to the better choice.

    "dialogue": "Pleasepullonetooth: Hi, I hope I'm in the right place for this subject matter. I have an upper back tooth that 3 dentists have refused to pull because I am taking keflex and by the time i get to the appointment the infection is gone. It usually flares up at night I go to urgent care get keflex make the appointment and they refuse to pull. When it's not flaring up they refuse to pull. When it flares up i brush and swish with alcohol that helps. The tooth itself shows no signs of decay only an old filling which may leak- or what ever. I figured out the problem but still no help. I had 2 extractions on the left back upper 1 wisdom extraction and the tooth next to it (damaged painful) well the 3rd tooth from the back has a triangular space between it and the tooth in front of it. Food literally gets shoved up into my gum line around that entire tooth and I feel it but i can't get the particles out sometimes even with flossing or those floss bristles. My gum is sore all the time. I dread eating anything but soft food (yuck) the other day I used the metal tip of the bristly little floss tool to dig under my gum AGAIN as usual and got 3 chunks of.. God knows what -it felt and looked like little pieces of cartilage but i dont eat cartilage so it must be something else.i felt the pressure gone! But id rather have this back tooth gone than deal with this pocket or gum issue another second. It starts to burn at night. If i jump up and brush with alcohol I catch it- sometimes. If the putrification of food particles in the gumline ensues my whole gumline, jaw, cheek head even eyeball burn and i run to urgent care get keflex and 5 hours later the pain subsides. Its such a hassle. I don't have insurance (I did and they only pay 15% of the common procedures that I need oh but they pay 85% of shit I never need so I cancelled). All I want is this back tooth OUT. So what if the tooth is good it's a problem. It's painful. It's expensive to remedy I dont want to go through any of it all I want is to never ever have to worry about the problem ever again and no one will pull it bc the tooth itself is not decayed. What do I have to do get my dremmel and dig my filling out then go back to the dentist with an ice pack on my face? I don't really WANT a power tool in my mouth but I've had it with the problem. The one dentist said awe all you need is a deep cleaning. ..  noooooo.. a deep cleaning will make the tooth clean ..hurray! But it will not stop food from getting lodged in my gumline DAMNIT can I just wiggle the tooth till its ready just like old times ? Its in there. or do I have to damage the tooth. I really cant believe this. 2 years of agony and infection. I cant take the pain till i get to the appointment once the burning starts i take keflex immediately it is excrucuating and I can't get an instant dentist appt the morning I call. So when my appt rolls around theres no sign of problem and the constant xrays amd exams are getting expensive HEY! Maybe that's The point huh? The pain and flare up is always at night. Sorry if you dont believe me that this tooth needs to come out. herein lies the problem. Tooth not worth it. Any advice from a NOT greedy dentist would be helpful thanks. MattKW: Rather than being greedy dentists, maybe they're more worried that if they remove the tooth as requested and yet the pain continues? On the one hand you have a burning pain which is resolved by alcohol (sounds like tooth nerve problem), or when you get Keflex (an infection of gum OR tooth), and yet dentists can't find reason for your pain. Perhaps it's a different pain altogether? A single dose of antibiotics that cures your problem sounds odd.  I have a patient with a neuralgia who is under care of a pain specialist, but just keeps coming back to check on the tooth. He really just hopes that it'll be the cause and taking it out will cure his problem, but we all know it'll not work, and just change the nature of his pain. He's OK again in a couple of days.

What else can I do , I'm 41 years old and my life has been on hold for the last few years because of my teeth , Any help I'd greatly appreciate or if someone had something similar \nThanks in advance honestdoc: I'm sorry for your serious condition.  I can picture what you are going through.  They had put a crown near your front teeth.  On x-ray, the dentist found an infection under the root tip.  The reason for this is the past dentist had to shave your teeth down to place the crown.  The drilling causes trauma to the nerve (root canal).  Over time, the traumatized nerve starts to die and became a source of infection.  Your 2 options are to get a root canal or to pull the tooth.The root canal is the only treatment to save the tooth and is costly.  With the tooth so infected, the root canal has to be done thoroughly and in multiple visits because all the micro anatomical areas are contaminated.  I would only trust a specialist or a very experienced general dentist because most dentists usually do not have the adequate skills or knowledge to fully treat a case like this.  However, the costs can be very high.The other option is to pull the tooth.  This is the most predictable option.  The downside is you will be missing the tooth on the esthetic zone.  You can have a temporary \"flipper\" which is a acrylic appliance with a tooth to cover the missing area and consider implant in the future.  I would stay away from a bridge because like a crown, the dentist needs shave down the abutments to fit the bridge in and you may repeat the experience in the future. Myself2018: Thank you for your reply I'm touched you took time out of your life , I asked the dentist yesterday if they pulled my tooth would it help the infection and they didn't give me a direct answer and made it out as if it wouldn't help , Would pulling my tooth help me with the infection , at the moment I'm laying down trying to bring my temperature down , I feel sick and dizzy ?Thank you honestdoc: Yes, pulling the tooth will remove the source of infection.  Possible difficulties are that if you are swollen, it may be hard to anesthetize.  You may also become resistant to the antibiotics if you were taking it too frequently.  I would have it pulled ASAP. Myself2018: I'm not swollen there where the tooth is its right at the top of my gums , What would they do with the lump that's there ? Because 3 sets of antibiotics haven't done anything will they drain it ? honestdoc: A possibility for the bump is the body is trying to drain it which is a good thing.  Do you notice any pus or foul drainage coming out of it?  You may be developing antibiotic resistance.  I'm from the US but I'm suspecting most of the UK NHS dentists are newly graduated and may not have experience.  Once they acquire that experience, they move on to more lucrative opportunities.  Just try your best and get that tooth pulled. Myself2018: No its solid lump no pus or anything its been there for now 3 months , after my face went swollen (unrecognizable) the hospital gave me antibiotics and the swelling all over my face went down but I was left with this lump I have now ,I'll defiantly will get my tooth pulled asap \nThank you ever so much for helping me , I feel much more at ease after your advice , I've been so worried , I hope the universe brings you good things Thanks again Busybee: I really do not understand why A&E did not refer you for emergency dental treatment in a hospital.   This is something you should have treated as part of A&E services.  Which part of the UK are you in? Myself2018: Really ? , I'm in wales ,\nI've had to ring NHS again just now to beg for a emergency appointment for tomorrow , because the health board booked me one for Friday , and I'm feeling so unwell I don't think I can handle another few nights laying in bed feeling dizzy and sick and in pain till early hours , The woman who booked me the appointment for Friday was not very nice to me , she seems annoyed that I wasn't happy with the dentist I'd seen telling me the bones in my face could crumble and I need treatment ASAP but couldnt give me any advice I'm so thankful for the info on here as now I'm able to tell the next dentist \"take my tooth out\" Busybee: I'm relieved that you have an appointment.   There are definitely emergency dental units in hospitals.  Just looked at Cardiff and Vale and they have a dental helpline.  They also have a note on their site to say you can have free supervised treatment by dental students.   I guess if you're in a more remote part of the country then access to services will be far more challenging. Please let us know how you get on.  Even after they remove the tooth it will take a while for such a serious infection to subside.  I am really concerned that the temporary dentist didn't do more.  After all it must have been a pretty bad infection at that stage. honestdoc: I am fascinated with how UK dental system works.  Please don't mind me, I love learning from you guys. AJK64: The nhs is in a really bad mess with regards dental treatment. I have had problems with a root canal after a badly botched nhs procedure and have had to take a loan and put myself in debt in an attempt to get it fixed privately. It's such a shame as about 20 years ago nhs dentistry was very highly regarded.I really hope you get it fixed fast myself2018. It's scary to feel out of control and that no one can help. Myself2018: You are right about the NHS , I also had botched up treatment , when I would have my check up I'd say that a certain tooth was sensitive and I'd always end up booking an appointment after ending up with toothache and there solution was ....take the tooth out , I wasn't given an xray , and my dentist who i saw would change every few months , so there was clearly something going on at that dental practice , \nWell here's an update , Thursday night I was in AnE hospital at 1am , I felt pressure on my heart , dizzy , high temperature , thirst , It was over an hour before a doctor seen me and then had to answer stupid things like \"have u banged your chest , or had any falls\" ?? , the most ridiculous questions , I had a blood test , he did my blood pressure and he mumbled it was low , ( something I've never had if anything its usually high) ,I had a ECG done (didn't tell me anything) , said I had to wait for a doctor , after 4 And half hours (it was daylight outside) and seeing this elderly lady who had been left in the waiting room in a wheelchair and was falling asleep , I felt so sorry for her , the doctor said to her \"I'll be back for you in half hour\" ,An hour and half later she was still there , I was so disgusted I walked out and went home , my partner told reception and they said I could ring my GP for results ,Friday \nWent to the dentist , she gave me anesthetic to numb it , and then pulled it out and sent me on my way , I asked her should I have any antibiotics and she said \"No the source where the infection was coming from has been taken out now so you should be fine\" ,I pray and pray that she is right , and I will start to feel normal again , and not have nights where I feel like I'm dying , I'll be so happy Thanks everyone for your input it has helped me a lot Myself2018: And I rang my doctors and they said no results yet , why am I not surprised ! I was at the hospital on wednesday night (early hours Thursday morning ) Busybee: Were the symptoms that led you to A&E related to your dental infection?   I am sure that if your EEG was abnormal they would have told you.  From what you say you may have been dehydrated.  It has been pretty hot lately.  Are you drinking enough water? They should really have put you on a drip.I'm pretty surprised that your GP would get any results from A&E.   That doesn't usually happen unless you are admitted. AJK64: Hopefully now your problem tooth has been removed your immune system will take care of any residing infecton. Sending you lots of positive thoughts. Please keep us all updated. AJK64: Any updates on how you are doing now ? Myself2018: Hi , All I was happy I seen a doctor that explained things to me and was more thorough than any doctor I'd seen before , I've been to the doctors for years (more so in the last year) about my stomach being swollen and I felt was pressing on something , a few months ago I went for a lump in my breast and the doctor said \"its very small and its just an infection \" and sent me on my way without even a prescription ! ,What I thought was weird was he said he couldn't access the hospital blood test and xray results ? , he said that he would need a number to access the pathology lab ? So he disregarded all the things I'd had done , He has sent me for a blood test to see if I have helicobacter pylori , he said it could be that , that is making me feel pressure by my liver and heart , he said \"your very tender by your liver and gall bladder\" and if the test result is negative he said they would book me in for a magic eye , I did say to him \"but the hospital took a few blood samples for testing and that might have been one of them I was tested for\" but he disregarded it ,He said my blood pressure was normal and my lungs were clear , he also put me on this medication that is a drink I have to drink twice a day to help me go to the toilet , it hasn't done anything yet ,I'm still having waves where I start feeling dizzy and get hot , really quickly , but the dizziness subsides but me getting hot stays and I haven't felt the pressure by my heart (touch wood) , every time I get hot (even my skin reacts as if I've been sunbathing , it goes red ) I also feel my heart beating , it feels like its hammering my chest , But that could well be because I'm stressing and worrying that I'll start feeling really Ill and won't be able to sleep ,I feel I'm getting better because I'm realising now that I am a tooth missing by my front teeth and being unable to afford a implant etc , it makes me feel so sad , because the dentist I'm on the waiting list for will be months again waiting , I have only 10 teeth on top of my mouth and 9 on the bottom (chewing food is a nightmare because I don't have any back teeth) , \nWhen my teeth started playing up years ago and the dentist said \"stop drinking coca cola because your teeth are suffering\" I gave up drinking 4 Litres a day , I brushed them 3 times a day and used mouthwash , gave up smoking , I just had the unfortunate dentists for years where I didn't even get an xray , its such a shame because if I'd spoken up years ago instead of trusting what they said , I might still have had full set of teeth , \nAll I've EVER wanted is a nice smile , my teeth weren't perfectly straight I had 2 teeth that needed pulling further front , and would smile behind my hand , \nBut that would have been fixable now I have nothing to work with  , even dentures cost a lot of money ,\nThank you all for your input it helped me so much x"

The new dentist also wants to do 4 implants after reviewing extensive x-rays.  This is a chain practice with a large staff and a lot of fancy equipment.  Even with the insurance these implants would cost $10,000 (this is not covered well by insurance) and correction for the overbite would be $5000.They say I have other problems too and are proposing $35,000 worth of work over the next few years.  If this is work I really need, I am tempted just to get dentures.I know none of you have specific details of my case but has any one run into this and do you think they are just trying to rip me off? John Roberts: I think I would get a second or third opinion.  Go to another dentist and don't say anything about what the first on said.  This is what I think.  Dental work is crazy high.  I am 71.  I have insurance on everything except my teeth.  I do believe some of the dentist are RIP off artist. honestdoc: Unfortunately most to all dental chains place pressure to the dentists to produce.

    "title": "A crown conundrum",
    "dialogue": "Cassandane: I had a very large filling on my upper molar (tooth #3) done 3.5 years ago. I would feel a jolt or electric feeling whenever I ate something hard beef jerky, etc. The feeling only occured at a specific cusp. The dentists I saw all said the filling was so big & a crown MAY fix it. Some of them said it may have a tiny fracture. I got a temporary crown put on a few weeks ago. Last week I went to get the permanent one placed but I told them that I still feel a small jolt feeling lasting like 1 second when i eat hard foods on that tooth. They examined the tooth said the bite was high. They adjusted it & told me to wait another week & see how the tooth reacts. My appointment for the permanent crown got pushed back for next week The adjustment was 6 days ago, I still notice the jolt is still there but less than it was b4 the temp. crown. When I bite down on the inner cusp thats where I feel the sensation - not felt anywhere else. Also, If I press my thumb against the tooth I can feel the jolt.  Its not painful. There is no sensitivity to cold or heat & no pain at night. On a scale of 1-10 its a 1(very very minor). The sensation comes on for 1 sec then disappears as I continue to chew.Questions: \n1. Do you think putting on a permanent crown will solve this jolty/electric feeling? Or maybe permanent crown with temporary cement? My crown is ready for placement a brand new porcelain one ready for me. But will it really solve this feeling once it is put on?2. Dont you think doing a root canal for such a small sensation is too extreme? Why kill a viable nerve for a small jolty feeling that is insignificant? A root canal was mentioned in the beginning as an option if the temporary crown or permanent crown dont work. They probably would do the root canal before placing the permanent one though. But to me a root canal is too radical for the small insignificant sensation I feel. What do you think? MattKW: 1. Permanent crown should hopefully settle it. One of the problems with temp crowns is that they can flex, and they have a temp cement which can leak, so can still have sensations. It's good that at least your symptoms have settled. The idea of a permanent crown with a temp cement has 2 problems: (i) you're still using a soft cement that can leak a bit, (ii) a good fitting permanent crown with even a temp cement can be a bugger to get off, and you risk damaging the perm crown.\n2. You can usually still do an RCT through a crown if it becomes necessary later, and still keep the crown in place. It is a bit of a pain, but doable.I agree that for the minor discomfort you're having right now, an RCT is overkill. Just ask the dentist if he'll be able to get through the crown later - some crown materials (Zirc) are almost impossible to cut through. Cassandane: Its been a month since the temporary crown has been placed. This past week I went to get the permanent crown placed and they asked me how the tooth is feeling sknThere is still a very minute feeling in the tooth. Its a 1 out of 10. The tooth is 98-99% good. Its just that 1% sensation i am feeling. The dentist said its up to me to decide what I want to do. He is fine with putting the permanent crown OR doing a root canal. He was also baffled and didnt know why the sensation is still there.He said the sensation may be very minor now but it could become worse if the crown is put on and in 3 months, 6 months, 1 year the tooth may need a root canal. I just dont understand if this sensation is from the nerve or from something else. It literally lasts for 1 second and goes away as I continue to chew whatever hard food I am eating. I can chew other foods normally. The analogy I can give is when you put the key in the ignition of an old car. The car rumbles for a second and sounds like its turning on and off but after that second passes the car turns on normally and you can drive it off.Again, the sensation is only felt on the inner cusp of the tooth and I can also feel it when I insert the floss and remove the floss. Im attaching a photo showing a red dot on the location of where I feel the sensation. If I chew on that specific point thats where I feel it. So is a root canal even warranted for this? I told the dentist I want to wait another month to see if the sensation goes away. The temporary crown is still intact. He said when he sees me in a month I have to have made my decision about either doing a root canal or placing the permanent crown. Is this really a nerve issue? Busybee: I am having the same problem Cassandane.  One dentist wanted to send me for a root treatment, the other wants me to wait a couple of months as he can see no sign of nerve failure on the x rays.    I am convinced that it's down to either the preparation or the temp crown letting in some food debris or bacteria.  The thing is that it was hurting last week but has now settled.   In the mornings it feels fine after wearing a night guard.  The dentist adjusted it down slightly the other day and for a couple of days it was painful but today I have no symptoms at all.  Flossing in a more thorough way seems to have helped.  I'm totally confused as to whether to cancel the endo and wait another two months or not.    Can a poor preparation or leaky temp crown cause this? Cassandane: My problem of this \"minor sensation\" existed long before my temporary crown was placed. Which leads me to believe that the temporary crown has nothing to do with this....My sensation emerged after a dentist did a filling on my tooth due to a cavity. The filling was pretty large and some dentists may attribute this sensation to that filling. My sensation is not even classified as \"pain\" its more of an annoyance.Can anyone tell us if this sensation is coming from the nerve or from something else? If its truly the nerve then my tooth should be going through excruciating pain since its been 3.5 years since my feeling arose. MY SENSATION HAS DIMINISHED OVER THESE 3 YEARS. At first it was a 4 out of 10 pain level, now its like a 1. I swear to God this does not feel like nerve pain at all. But who I am to judge. I aint no dentist to know....My sensation is so minute. Its just a tiny jolt when eating hard foods. The jolt lasts 1 second and I can continue eating that specific food. Does this warrant a root canal? I have no idea.... maybe I need to get a second opinion from an endo. to see whether he thinks this is a nerve issue or a totally unrelated issue maybe arising from the crown buildup. Maybe my filling in that tooth was too big... Maybe in a month things will settle... too many maybes. If anyone can provide feedback about whether this small sensation is nerve related, it would be great to hear!"

    "dialogue": "HarryJW: I was having problems with my right rabbit tooth as i thought it was coming loose and too make sure it was fine at that moment i would often gently put my top front teeth and bottom front teeth together like and edge to edge bite to see and i would do this alot through out the day and a after a couple of days my tooth got better but then noticed that when i spoke and ate my front teeth hit each other then i realised that i had edge to edge bite when i just relaxed my mouth which i never had, to make my teeth touch like that in the past i would have to move my jaw out but now it is just like it all the time. Would love some help as i can't get into a dentist until august. honestdoc: Usually people do not have an edge to edge bite.  A slight overbite would be ideal.  The top teeth moves the cheek and lips out of the way while the lower teeth moves the tongue away when functioning.  An edge to edge bite runs a very high risk of chipping teeth especially up front.  Unless you dislocate the TMJ joint, your teeth should bite into its normal position. HarryJW: Hello, no when in it's normal position my front top teeth sit on my bottom front teeth and when i eat or talk they something hit each other, this only recently happened and never used to be like it.Also its really uncomfortable or me when my mouth is doing anything even when its relaxed. Strange that i never had this before until a few days a go Busybee: Have your wisdom teeth come through yet? HarryJW: No they haven't Busybee: Do you mind me asking how old you are? HarryJW: 18 Busybee: Your wisdom teeth may be coming through and causing changes to your bite.   You'd need to post an x ray here if you would like the dentists to try to analyse a cause.  But at your age things can move about for that reason.    If your bite is uncomfortable you should see a dentist to see whether they suggest removing the wisdom teeth or whether there is any other cause.   It could be why your tooth felt loose. HarryJW: Oh right well thankyou, only problem is i cant see a dentist until august. Busybee: when did you last have x rays? HarryJW: I never have, not at dentist or doctors. Busybee: Ok in that case maybe post some photographs of your teeth coming together showing the problem. HarryJW: of my front teeth? (edge to edge bite) Busybee: Yes of your bite at few different angles HarryJW: ok give me some minutes. HarryJW:  HarryJW: I hope this is ok, the right tooth (in the pic) slightly goes over but not enough and my left is on top. If you need more angles then please say Busybee: The dentists here may need side views. HarryJW:  HarryJW: i hope this is ok"

    "dialogue": "alethea: Hello, I am not happy.  My own dentist is off having a baby for the last year.  I have not had a check up for a year but I had been at the dental hospital about one of my teeth and had to go back to have work finished.  This caused problems with the dentist and eventually they discovered the dental hospital had looked at the wrong tooth and decided they would need to take that tooth out.  A very heavily filled tooth had the filling fall out around Christmas and I have several times been back as the temp filling which was put in has fallen out.  It was supposed to be suitable for a crown then.  Then another filling fell out.  I had some pain in a lower tooth which I thought was an absess and as I was due for an operation in a few days which would have meant I could not visit the dentist I went to get it checked - no absess was found.  I did mention to her that I had pain round all my teeth but I have had that for 30 years. The dentist got a denture for the tooth she was going to take out but could not get it out because she could not get me pain free.  She then decided she wanted a full teeth xray - she did say that she did not want me to have one denture and then to have to keep going back for more.  I saw her today and she wants to take out at least half my teeth.  When I asked why she said because they have 'poor prognosis' nothing more.  I am wondering if she is taking them out because I have been going back and forth but that is mainly because she keeps putting in temp fillings which keep coming out rather than getting the work done.  I don't know what to do/  Any ideas?  I am 68 years old. honestdoc: Please provide a panoramic x-ray.  Try to find a dentist you trust and stick with him or her.  Tell the dentist you want the least traumatic, most predictable and practical options. alethea: I don't have the xray.  It is at the dentists.  I am in the UK.

    "title": "Damaged enamel=decay?",
    "dialogue": "karl222: I have white spots on my front teeth signalling weakened enamel, no doubt from poor brushing habits as a child. Considering I brush, floss, mouthwash twice a day, is it likely that the worn enamel will still lead to decay in the future? Thanks in advance. honestdoc: It is difficult to predict.  Dentists consider risk factors.  There is a triad of major risk factors for teeth health.  First is home care.  Your friendly hygienist can help you with good home care.  Second is diet.  I find that sugary and acidic beverages can really damage your teeth because it bathes all surfaces.  The longer the beverage gets in contact, the more damage.  Third factor is adequate Fluoride whether in the toothpaste, topical application in the dental clinic, or systemic in the water source.  Other factors can include inadequate saliva flow from medications and or radiation treatments.  Worn enamel may not protect as well as intact enamel so you need to take more effort in reducing your risks.  The areas in teeth that tend to get cavities are in between teeth, occlusal (biting surfaces) and along the gum line.  The natural cleaning ability of the tongue and cheek as well as adequate saliva flow usually protects most of the teeth's other surfaces. karl222: Thanks very much for the reply.I'm fairly well-covered regarding those risk factors. Little sugary food, little alcohol, I use fluoridated toothpaste and I don't suppose there's anything wrong with my saliva. One more question if you don't mind: is whitening treatment a poor idea under my circumstances? honestdoc: Whitening will not alter the strength of enamel.  It may make your teeth and gums more sensitive.  It won't whiten any restorations and may make them not match up.  Whitening is only temporary and your teeth will slowly go back to its original color."

    "dialogue": "SarahVictoria1988: Hi, I am desperately seeking some advice! I am not a fan of visits to the dentist but had some toothache so eventually bit the bullet (ba-dum-tish) and made an appointment with a dentist based on a recommendation by my mum. I went for the intial consultation, had an x-ray and a poke around, and was booked in for the following week for a filling. When I went back for the filling it was gone closing time by the time I actually went through. He gave me a mirror so I could see what was happening, that I tried not to use because I didn’t want to know what was going on! He told me the filling was quite deep, and tried to show me the nerve (no thank you!), and it was really close to the next tooth so some discomfort and sensitivity should be expected for a few days. He filled it in and was out of the room, leaving me with the nurse, before I could even sit up. When the injection wore off that night I felt awful, like I’d been punched in the face, but felt a little better the next day. Just over a week later I still couldn’t expose the tooth to hot or cold, or chew on that side of my mouth. The pain was constant but not debilitating, but enough to need pain killers once or twice a day. So I called the dentist and they saw me that afternoon. Another x Ray later and she tells me the tooth should come out!! This was totally unexpected and quite a shock. She did say I could try a root canal but “these don’t always work” and can “cost up to £750”! This was a different dentist than the first one I saw as he was off, but she came across as very defensive of him and kept telling me he hadn’t done anything wrong, even though I’d never suggested he had. Sorry for droning on, finally to the point - what do I do? The tooth is close to the front on the bottom I really don’t want to lose it. I’m in ALOT more pain than I was before I went to the dentist so now I am wondering, has something gone wrong and they don’t want to own up to it? Or is this normal and I’m just being an idiot? Is root canal a better option than extraction? Or is it a costly endeavour that could lead to extraction anyway? Or should I be getting a second opinion? And should the filling of been put straight onto a nerve in the first place?! Thank you! honestdoc: Saving the teeth with root canals and crowns can be expensive.  You alternative is to extract the tooth.  Some teeth especially the Upper first molars tend to fail with root canals due to its complex anatomy.  It is best to talk with the same dentist who you feel most comfortable with and go over your options.  Many dentists will refer complex root canals to specialists but the costs may be astronomically high."

I went about a week ago for a cleaning and a few days later I have noticed that I am experiencing a burning/tingling sensation in gums/tongue. I usually don't pay too close attention to what my gums look like and I want to know what healthy gums look like. Is this a picture of healthy gums? Is the white towards the bottom where the roots of your teeth would be normal? honestdoc: According to the image, the gums may have some isolated inflammation and redness.  The white areas are normal for they cover normal bony projections.  A more accurate image is to take Bitewing x-rays to capture the internal bone levels.  With periodontitis, the bone gets irreversibly damaged and recede.  As long as bone level is solid, get a thorough dental cleaning and keep up the recommended homecare and dental visit intervals.  If there are bone damage and bone loss, you will need to have deep cleaning, more frequent maintenance and followups, and possible gum surgery,"

Busybee: It's impossible to tell what caused your cavity.  But you can always rinse your mouth with water instead of drinking it.   Maybe use a straw with sweet drinks or avoid them.If you have gastritis it's also possible that you may have had acid coming up into the mouth at some point.   That sort of thing can really damage enamel.  If you have thrown up because of gastritis that's pretty bad for teeth too as it will include some acid.  Is the gastritis chronic and were you tested for H pylori?Are you sufficiently hydrated before you eat?     Saliva is really important to preventing cavities and maybe your mouth is too dry if you have to wait to drink."

I have been to countless dentist, several general practitioner doctors, ent, oral surgeon, and a few more I can't think of.  None of the dentist had any idea what was wrong or if they did they didn't say.  One of the dentist did want to do tens type therapy and a 6,500 orthic type device but didn't really say what was wrong.  The rest of them gave me no clue.  I finally went to a neurologist.  He said it was in my nerves and diagnosed me with trigeminal neuralgia.  I don't  necessarily think I have the symptoms some people have but I am sure it is some type of neuralgia. He is having a MRI on my head and spine.  I have been having a lot of neck, teeth, eyes and some facial pain but my teeth bother me the most.  He has me on a anticonvultant type medicine.  He said the dentist couldn't do me any good.  I am just glad I didn't start having root canals, fillings replaced and such.  He basically said I am subconsciously changed my bite because the pain in my teeth moves around and it does.  I would just say that if anyone is having trouble with all their teeth and the dentist can tell you anything you may want to see a neurologist.   All my trouble started after a cleaning and fluoride treatment at the dentist. MattKW: Sometimes it's the other way around. Patients have gone to GPs, hospitals, neurologists, and it turns out to be dental. I hope you are finally getting better. Busybee: The trigeminal nerve does feed into most areas of the jaw, sinus and TM joint and eye socket so if you have a problem with it you can be sure to feel pain in similar areas to dental pain.     Even if they work out what's causing it doesn't mean it's easy to treat.   But they can at least help you with pain management. John Roberts: Matt.  If it is or was dental you would think one of the dentist I have been to would be able to figure it out.  I think I have been to one of every kind and none of them told me anything.  The last one said he couldn't see anything wrong on the xrays.  He said it could be some type of nerve problem which the way I feel I agree.  I don't know.\nBusybee.  I know it isn't easy to treat and I think I had a problem with it in my eye and forehead a few years ago.  One of the doctors then said I had some type of neuralgia and tried to treat it with no luck on the medicine he tired.  I got off all medicine and it eventually got better on its own.  I have heard there is no cure for it.  I know they have gamma knife surgery but I am hoping they can control the pain with medication.  I know I am trying to doctor myself but I think it may be in my neck where the trigemianl nerve starts because I am having trouble top and bottom.  Just a guess.  Maybe the MRI will tell something. I do feel better hopefully knowing what it is instead of the doctors saying they don't know.  Very frustrating.  I will post along.  Thanks for the comments. Busybee: John, I've had problems with my neck and shoulder and I suspect that it's down to that area for me too.   But what I have found is that when my bite was really off the neck and shoulder hurt too and my posture felt off too.    I'm sure it's curable but with so many variables it's impossible to pinpoint what exactly causes the pain.   One thing leads to another and then your body compensates and somehow ends up pressing on the nerve.  I know you are going to look at neuro forums but please do let us know how you get on with the neurologist. MattKW: John Roberts said:\t\t\tMatt.  If it is or was dental you would think one of the dentist I have been to would be able to figure it out.  I think I have been to one of every kind and none of them told me anything.

Thanks for the comments.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Unfortunately, the longer that you have the cause of any pain undiagnosed, the more it will start to refer to other places, and the worse you become. Dentally, I had a patient 3 weeks ago where he'd been seen by another dentist, then had the run-around including neuropathic drugs and heads scans at the hospital before I found a cracked tooth which had never been filled; very, very rare. Even then, I wanted to be absolutely sure before I extracted, so gave him a long-lasting LA, then he returned in relief, so I took out the nerve as an emergency measure, and when that continued the relief, I took out the tooth. You have to be very careful to avoid aggressive treatment as this will often cause pain of its own, and \"muddy the waters\" for subsequent investigations. Sometimes a nerve block can help isolate the cause to a general area. John Roberts: Thanks Busybee and Matt.  I am going for the MRI n the 28th.  I will post on the results.\nI agree totally about being diagnosed and I have been trying.  The dentist tell me they can't see anything.  If they did miss a cracked tooth would it make most all of my teeth top and bottom hurt.  I have a jaw tooth that only had a partial root canal done it and at one time it was bothering me the most but it was contacting the top tooth.  I did not have the root canal done and it bothers me no more than the rest of my teeth, maybe less.  For now I am going with the Neuralgia diagnosis.\nBusybee.  I have definately had more trouble with my neck than usual and I know my posture isn't good.  Head to far forward and I know it pulls on my neck.  Hope the mri shows something."

In the US LA cartridges contain 1.8mL, so the Maximum Recommended Dose (MRD) would be about 13 cartridges. The MRD is half the toxic dose, but there are records of people having even more."

    "dialogue": "Creeseh: HelloI will try to be short and to the point.  Dentist did a root canal (2004) on left upper #16.  It stayed infected with pain for a year using off and on antibiotics. I had fistula the last 4 months even with taking two antibiotics.I then get an apico from a surgeon.  He reopened it two times in two years because infection would come and go.  Finally he opted to pull the #16 and all was ok for  a year.  I did have pain still there though up in the gum area.  After a year it started all over with swelling and pain.  Then it would leave and come back months later.  I felt nauseated alot with face and ear pain.  Same surgeon decided to go back in again.  He said the bone was mushy and soft.  Debrided and scraped infection out and stitched me back up along gum line.  I had to go back several times throughout the years with recurring issues.  Currently he says there is nothing he can do since he cant see anything on cone beam scans.  I have seen ENT, family MD, neurologist and list goes on.  I had #15 pulled because of pain there when they said it needed root canal.  Currently upper gum #16 swells up then goes down.  When it decides to swell like the picture I am adding I get nausea and sick.  Joints hurt a over like I have the flu or something..They see this and scratch their heads.  I need help!!!!!  In pain and going numb sometimes.  Any suggestions!!!???   Please! Busybee: Perhaps you should see an implant specialist or periodontist. MattKW: Go to another surgeon. Any surgeon that attempts an apico on a #16 is very strange. Where are you in the world? Creeseh: Hello MattKW,I live in Nashville, Tennessee.  I checked the numbering on the teeth to be sure and identified it is #15 & 16 area.  My GP is setting me up with a Surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.My Neurologist is on board also after assuring me the swelling is not a nerve condition.  I had a sledding accident in 08 which caused me to get fused at c3 and c4 but this condition had already begun.  At the most irritated hours my gum will extend longer than my teeth with a white area at the tip.  As in the photo, it sometimes takes the form of a cone and is very painful.  Thank you! Creeseh: Thanks Busybee!  I will take that into consideration."

But my grandson also has the same type of connective frenum on each side of his upper teeth, between his canine and first molar. Is this common?  He has his first pediatric dental appointment scheduled for a bit later this summer,  but I wondered if we should be concerned. honestdoc: I believe it is normal.  Check his bite.  There should be a slight overbite across all his upper teeth against the lower.  This is designed so that as one bites, the top teeth moves the cheek and lips out of the way and the lower teeth moves the tongue away.  This also creates natural alignment.  As long as there are enough room, the top teeth will be aligned by the cheek and lips while the tongue pushes the lower teeth to proper position."

    "dialogue": "Fazzio349: I went to get a cavity filled about 3 months ago. It was pretty deep, almost to the nerve. It was extremely sensitive for awhile. For the most part, the sensitivity has gone away but when I bite down on something hard like let's say a pretzel, it really hurts. It even hurts when I floss in between the tooth. I never felt any pain or sensitivity until the cavity was filled. I went back to the dentist who then grinded it down a little bit too fix the bite. It did absolutely nothing. She mentioned it could be awhile before everything feels normal but this doesn't feel right. Do I just need to wait it out or is something else wrong here? honestdoc: You mentioned the cavity was close to the nerve.  That means the nerve is traumatized after the filling.  The nerve will either get better or not.  How you will know is if the pain is getting worse.  That means the nerve is damaged.  Another way to know how the tooth is doing is the cold sensitivity.  Healthy nerve will feel cold and the sensation will go away.  Damaged nerve will make it unbearable and can wake you up at night.  A dying nerve will not feel cold and many times will not feel pain.  You may feel better and have no pain.  However, you may have swelling and that means the dying or dead nerve became infected.I would monitor the pain and if it gets worse or too intense, go back to the dentist and discuss a possible root canal treatment. MattKW: Three months is more than long enough. If you have X-rays available, pls post up here. Some options to consider:A very deep filling and the nerve is not going to recover. It happens, even if you weren't in pain before the filling. Consider an RCT.The tooth has been filled with a composite, and the bond is not secure. Leakage can occur, allowing bacteria to infiltrate. Consider having the filling redone, either in composite, or preferably in amalgam (doesn't leak). Talk to the dentist."

Researchers are developing teeth buds from the embryonic cells of the bladder in rats but have yet to advance to predictable and practical applications.Restorative wise, there are a new generation of bioactive materials such as Activa that are very promising.  Previous generation materials are biocompatible.  Bioactive materials are such that it thrives in the body and cells such as cementum can regrow over it as oppose to biocompatible which means the body just tolerates it."

When did it start?  Did you use a new toothpaste, mouth rinse, herbal supplements, cinnamon products, medications, food coloring, etc.?  It looks like a canker sore like Dr. MattKW mentioned but it is very painful.  A medication that would help is a corticosteroid in dental paste like Triamcinolone which will mildly suppress the immune system around the lesion.Under the tongue looks normal.  That condition is called migratory glossitis or geographic tongue.  If it is a tumor or cancer, the lesion would not go away in 3-5 days."

When it first broke there was no pain at all and I'm not sure when it actually broke I just found it by running my tongue over my teeth. Its been over a month now and all of a sudden I have a lot of pain in that whole upper side of my mouth. Since being an adult (40 yrs old) I have never had dental work besides cleanings. My question is can I have the tooth pulled by a regular dentist? I don't have insurance and can not afford to go to a surgeon. I'm also already very anxious to have it done. honestdoc: Usually the upper wisdom teeth are less traumatic to remove compared to the lower ones.  That is because the bone around it is less dense/bulky.  Factors that can make it more difficult is if lower tooth is contacting it which can harden the bone, and if the tooth has a divergent root anatomy.  Factors that can make it more risky is if you have any medical conditions such as severe heart disease, very high blood pressure, taking blood thinning medications, and close proximity to sinus.  Most likely you are not but if someone were to take bisphosphonate injections, severe bone damage can occur after teeth extraction."

Depending on the predictability of success, a dentist will tell you options such as root canal, root canal and crown or tooth extraction.A rare possibility is viral like herpes which does not respond to antibiotics or canker sore which is the body's autoimmune response.

I think he was remarking on this because of the wear and tear he saw on my teeth.  I have been asked the same question many years ago when I was in my early 30's.  I am now 58 years old.  I have read that teeth grinders are not good candidates for implants.  Any one have any thoughts.  (I may have posted this already.  I am new to the site and am still figuring it out.) MattKW: There's a lot to consider, and you haven't given me much info to work with. An OPG X-ray would be a good start. At 58, some wear and tear is to be expected, but whether it is of concern or not depends on how many teeth you have remaining, and how bad is the damage. If you partner doesn't complain of you grinding your teeth at night, then you're prob not a grinder. For true grinders, most crowns (including implant-supported crowns) can be at risk of fracturing. The best crowns for grinders are probably a gold alloy. Implants do not work the same as real teeth. Real teeth have a periodontal ligament - when you squeeze hard, you can feel your teeth will \"give\" a little. Implants have no \"give\", and the crowns are constructed to touch only at maximum pressure (if mixed with real teeth)."

I cannot understand why she does not do a root canal immediately and remove the whole lot?Thank you in advance. MattKW: Sounds OK. The endodontic specialist will give you a more detailed assessment of risks, but a good endo has success rates 90%+. It is nearly always important to crown these teeth afterwards, as they are quite weak. the endodontist will confirm this too. If it's a last molar, i prefer gold crowns so as to preserve as much natural tooth as possible. 2nd last molars can be crowned in something more aesthetic if you wish - discuss this with your dentist.

Athethos: Thanks for the feedback, I think I'm leaning more towards Sonicare, never used a sonic toothbrush before (they're quite pricey, if you want a decent one), but I guess this one's a pretty solid choice to start with. Arthur Fitzherbert: I myself have got the vitality precision clean electric toothbrush, for the price i'd say it was well worth it Busybee: You don't have to buy the most expensive model as some have unnecessary features.    I tried others but my teeth and gums are healthier with sonicare.    You do need to replace them every two or three years.  The motor on all electric brushes starts to be less effective after a while. lomo12: Is it better to use a toothbrush with soft bristles or hard bristles? I prefer the harder kind because I feel like it does a better job of cleaning but always wondered if it's bad for your gums or not. Busybee: The electric brushes don't tend to have hard bristles because even with the softer ones your can over brush your teeth.   For manual brushes I go for medium.  You don't need to scrub to do a good job and scrubbing can damage enamel. Uptown101: Hello Athethos,In order to select tootbrush here are the Tips,\n1. Any toothbrush you choose should have soft bristles because Hard bristles may cause your  gum tissue to pull back from teeth which can expose the tooth root and lead to increased sensitivity to heat, cold or certain foods and drinks.\n2. Select a toothbrush head size that can easily fit into your mouth and can brush one to two teeth at a time (the general size is 1\" long and ½\" wide).\n3.Powered toothbrushes don’t clean teeth any better than regular toothbrushes. However, if a powered toothbrush motivates you to clean your teeth more often and for the required length of time, it is worth the investment.\n4.Powered toothbrushes are better choices than manual toothbrushes for anyone who needs assistance brushing teeth, including people with arthritis (or any condition that may limit mobility), anyone wearing braces or people with misaligned or uneven teeth surfaces that make a thorough cleaning more challenging.\n5.Replace your toothbrush as soon as the bristles begin to look worn or frayed (usually every three months). A worn toothbrush does not do a good job of cleaning your teeth. Remember always to replace your toothbrush after an illness.\nIf you’re still undecided about which toothbrush to use, consult your dentist for advice. MattKW: Sonic toothbrushes aren't as good as rotary brushes in a technical sense. However, if it makes you brush your teeth regularly, then there's probably no difference; it's all about thoroughly brushing 2x daily. The Rotadent are great - my wife has used them for 20 years, but unfortunately i have to import from USA. The more expensive electric toothbrushes prob aren't worth the extra cost over standard models. Busybee: MattKW said:\t\t\tSonic toothbrushes aren't as good as rotary brushes in a technical sense.

The rotary are limited because of shape and action.  The one I had was great at getting rid of plaque, but not so great on gum margins.    Sometimes I think a good brush with a decent old fashioned toothbrush is helpful as a backup."

But to tear through the sinus lining into the sinus is extremely unlucky. Lower wisdoms have the problem of being surrounded by more thicker bone, and they are often at odd angle, so surgical bone removal may be required."

I'm not sure if they've always been like this but i've only just noticed. I'm 20 and I live in the UK but i'm on holiday in Florida for 5 weeks.I recently purchased some new tooth whitening mouth wash which I thought was amazing, you could see the results after using it, it was brilliant. After looking online I found this may be the cause of why they've gone so clear. I may also add my tooth paste is whitening too! (although it feels like it makes no difference)I have now stopped using the mouth wash until I can get a definitive answer\nAre my teeth damaged for life? is there anything I can do to help them. I've looked online but have got mixed opinions on the problemThanks all, greatly appreciated CrescentTooth: Wow. This is an old thread. You still deserve an answer though. Some of my teeth also look translucent. The tooth whitening can be an issue if it's extra caustic but what I've discovered is that it was caused by acid reflux in my case. Sometimes you don't even know you have it. Go to your General Practitioner and find out if you have Acid Reflux. I've seen some dentists have a remineralization program for the teeth but I'm not sure how well it works and it's probably very expensive. The only way surefire way is to get veneers, that's what I'm about to do"

My fork was on its side when I bit down and although there is no chip, I believe I bit down so that it \"lodged\" between my two center bottom teeth. I thought it was knocked back so i panicked and I tried (idiotically) to push it forward. I couldn't. The teeth did move somewhat forward so there is some looseness. Later I realized that that little bit of forward movement of the affected teeth didn't allow for the normal overbite and realized that the teeth probably was not knocked back. But it's a bit loose now, sensitive and painful if I chew on it, and there is a sensation that it was dislodged a little bit out. I went to the dentist here in DR, but they are closed because of a national holiday. Do you think it would be too late if I went to see the doctor tomorrow?

If this is ceramic crown, it cantc be discoloured at any cost unless purposely done, even while drinking soda, alcohol, strong tea, chocolates etc. Anyway crown may comes in Resin category too.\n  Types- metallic, resin, ceramic, metal ceramic.\n     Resin crown may loose texture and colour. It can be discoloured with time by rigorous use of strong tea/coffee, chocolates use, alcohol strong, hard brushing, more conscious about that crown to keep it clean and hard brush, not maintain oral hygiene, lots of soda drink use, pulp tissue damage/reinfection of treated tooth (RCT) etc.\n       Hence RCT fail may be a cause too. \n  1. If crown is darken due to resin made or low quality ceramic used (thin layer) then it can be replaced. No need of RCT.\n  2. If dentist insist on re RCT, it means that was a failure. Though you don't feel starting symptoms.\n     I suggest, change dentist (where do you live? I may search for another Endodontist/ experienced dentist).\n     * This time take ' Dental Insurance' policy. Ask your agent.

Example are Falling on your face, eating something with sharp edges, and even brushing or flossing your teeth too hard can bruise your gums. Bruises on the gums are usually dark red or purple, but they can also be dark brown or black. You may also have some minor bleeding and pain in addition to the bruise.

Dude you are suffering from Acute Apical Periodontitis. Your x-rays need to be studied properly. Individual &  lateral x-rays need to be checked. If it is then RCT is a choice. If dentist make precise pulp access opening with telescope or dental loupe, then no problem. You may get only post & core with composite restoration. Unless ceramic crown is better. Now your periodontal scaling and obviously ''Root planning\" may be required. Don't worry, just check an expert dentist nearby.\n     Pulpitis is inflammation of pulp tissues. This may be the reason. But as you say while applying bite force then pain aggravates. It is AAP.  Need to see x-rays, if apical root has any lesion unless pulp infection. Periodontal problem is related in this case. Get x-rays,,, lateral & individual of teeth region. Nothing to do with sinus. MattKW: Oh Lordy, where do some of these people come from?Sinus pain is possibly indicated if pain occurs when standing up, not if pain subsides. Nor will it be a perio problem. We're jumping way out into space with suggestion of AAP and needing X-rays.\nGiven that you haven't been treated for 7 years, and pain occured after several small fillings, then most likely simply the fillings. You can try some sensitivity toothpaste while you wait for dentist appointment. If necessary, perhaps a filling or two may be leaking and require replacement. I'm assuming you've had composite (white) fillings, and the seal on these tends to be poor if they have to go under the gum. Maybe you should ask if they need to be replaced with amalgam.

What can I use to make them more white as I have an event to go to and am very self conscious about my teeth.\nThanks Uptown101: Hello Babs82,To get rid of  your yellow teeth,  get them properly cleaned by visiting your dental hygienist every six months for a scale and polish unless your dentist recommends otherwise. Getting your yellow teeth scaled can remove any tartar build-up and then polishing the surfaces of your teeth with special instruments. You might be surprised at how much brighter your teeth appear after this."

    "dialogue": "User17: Everything was fine, until yesterday the right part of my bottom teeth started hurting when I drank something cold or ate ice cream, and this is really annoying.\nSomeone knows what can I do for my teeth to stop hurting or what can be the reason it started?\nThanks for your help. Busybee: There are all sorts of reasons.  Could be that you are grinding, could be erosion from fizzy drinks or from acid attacks, could be under-brushing or over-brushing.   If you want to try to mitigate this then don't brush too hard, get a night guard so you don't grind when you sleep, relax your jaw in the day (don't clench), avoid fizzy drinks or acidic food/drinks, floss, use a sensitive toothpaste, go to regular hygiene appointments.   Sometimes you just inherit this from parents.   If you look after your teeth and avoid triggers for a while it should settle.   Maybe your hygienist can show  you some brushing techniques. Uptown101: Hello,If eating ice cream and drinking cold drinks make your teeth hurt, you are probably suffering from cold-sensitive teeth. Cold-sensitive teeth are not uncommon, but it’s important to understand the difference between cold-sensitive teeth and tooth decay or gum disease. Cold-sensitive teeth occur when the nerves within the tooth are exposed due to receding gums or worn tooth enamel. To avoid Cold-sensitive teeth try to avoid biting into very cold foods—for example, lick your ice cream instead of biting into it. Also use a toothbrush with soft bristles and soft dental floss. A soft-bristled brush can help reduce the gum irritation that may make teeth sensitive. For your sensitive teeth you can use the Crest Pro-Health Sensitive Shield toothpaste it's designed to reduce the cold sensitivity in teeth by  covering up exposed dentinal tubules thereby preventing a cold stimulus from causing the fluid in the tubules to flow."

It feels almost like a somewhat sharp (not that sharp) bone/tooth piece, light brown color. No pain in gums or the piece when I mess with it.  I’ve tried to pull on it, but didn’t budge. I did have a root canal on this tooth maybe 7 years ago after a large portion of my front tooth was knocked out, but it wasn’t an extraction, so I don’t think it’s a shard? It feel like bone material that’s exposed. I noticed it a few weeks ago when my tongue pressed on it, now it’s driving me insane! It definitely feels foreign, who knows how longs it’s been there though. Any help is truly appreciated as I won’t be able to visit my dentist for a while. Busybee: Have you been to the dentist? That is probably the best place to start. MattKW: Doesn't look like bone. Looks like tooth fragment but how or why I can't tell. Just keep it clean and get to dentist when you can.

KVMCruces: Hi Samantha,If I were you I'd look for a periodontist or oral surgeon (both may be fully qualified to do your dental implants) in or near your area. It also depends on your situation and what you need - for example if you have something like extensive gum disease then a periodontist may be the best fit for you.\nMake sure you research the clinic, not all reviews are accurate (theres always a bad apple or two) but be sure you read through them as well. Also try to find out what you can about the doctors qualifications, results and previous patient cases. And lastly, if you're able to afford the costs always do at least 2 consultations.Best of luck!"

I’ve recently switched to predominately chewing on my right side now as to avoid this awkwardness / pain. I can only imagine that this is due to my wisdom teeth starting to come in? Should I be seeking to get them removed ASAP due to this happening or am I okay to wait until my physical appointment to get them out? I’m a 22 yo male. Any commentary would be useful. Busybee: Less than a month is hardly any time to wait so unless you are feeling sick with a fever or if you're in agony you may as well keep the appointment  you have.

My son s front teeth are also very yellow. Busybee: I'm not an expert on this but have you had your children tested for nutritional absorption issues/amino acid deficiency / pernicious anaemia etc?    It's possible that there's something blocking normal processing of vit D and calcium.   Can happen with gluten/lactose intolerance among others. Chez: Thank you for replying. I've not had my children tested no as I'm not sure how I go about it but I will look in to that thank you. I had antibiotics in my 4 pregnancies unfortunately though. Busybee: Go to a nutritionist.   They can advise you on tests.  It should not be too expensive.  Worth ruling it out, but it if they do find there is a defect they can remedy it with different approaches while the child is still developing. MattKW: The teeth don't look particularly chipped to me; it is not unusual for baby teeth to wear down a bit over time, but your photo is too indistinct. Hypoplasia in baby teeth is extremely rare, and the Mum would have had to have serious medical issues during pregnancy to affect baby teeth (and not affect rest of child in some way). It is certainly not a nutritional issue, and you would be wasting your money by going to a nutritionist or undergoing unnecessary medical tests; plus causing yourself stress. As for yellow front teeth - baby teeth are always whiter than adult teeth, so he may just be \"normal\". Have you been to a dentist? Chez: Thank you for your reply. I have seen a dentist but my daughter has a lot of dental issues and I felt the dentist fobbed me off ( absolutely thought he was lovely) and I told the receptionist this at the dentist's as I aaked to see if more could be done I went an appointment as arranged he shouted at me and refused to see myself and my children again ( although I wouldn't go back) but I am trying get in a new dentist Chez: This is my son's teeth yesterday his front tooth on the right has been repaired a boy threw a brick at his tooth.

I am based in UK and I also asked if my daughter could have her teeth capped (with  decay) its just spreading so bad I am genuinely at a loss at where I am going wrong  I know it doesn't look like that but I am honestly trying my best. Busybee: I'm not a dentist but your son's adult teeth look pretty healthy and normal.   Yellow isn't always a bad thing in adult teeth.   Don't blame yourself.  Have you asked about having their teeth sealed?   I don't think they do this any more as a matter of course on the NHS these days but a dentist can still do it and could avoid cavities in adult teeth.  It could be genetic factors but try to avoid acidic \"healthy\" drinks and acidic fruit too.   It's not just sugar than harms enamel.   A friend who was a dentist once told me that the worst thing to eat for decay is raisins.    Some people think that's  a healthy snack.   I've read that brushing teeth right after eating isn't good for the enamel either.  Apparently the enamel is more soft just after eating, particularly after eating anything than generates an acid attack.  Best to rinse with water and wait 20 mins to brush.    Avoid carbonated drinks even if they have no sugar.    I'm sure you know all this already. MattKW: Chez said:\t\t\tSorry to post again.

If you think the \"chips\" are the bumps on the teeth, then no, these are called mamelons and are a normal part of tooth growth. Mamelons normally wear down as we get older - you probably don't have them anymore. Tooth55 is same photo.\nTooth66 shows some minor decay around margins of front teeth, and a bit more decay around upper left 1st molar. usually no need to treat these as they are unlikely to get worse. Just make sure back molars are in good condition - you need Xrays. The dark upper front left tooth is probably from a bump as a toddler; no need for treatment unless pain or swelling, and it will not have caused damage to underlying adult tooth.Tooth montage ddd really hard to see clearly.\nIn general, damage to front baby teeth is treated conservatively. If you look after them, they will not worsen, and I would not suggest \"capping\" front teeth just for the appearance.Baby molars must be examined carefully for decay and treated promptly, sometimes with stainless steel caps. Just keep up regular visits to dentist.

I've dealt with repetitive strange decaying issues with all my teeth since birth (not necessarily cavities, I usually don't have any black in/on my teeth, but strange holes keep forming no matter how good my dental care is), and have had multiple appointments to reshape my teeth. Problem is, my upper front teeth on the right (mainly the canine tooth) are constantly hitting my lower teeth (also mainly my canine on the bottom as well, so both canine teeth on the right keep hitting each other), and the bonding resin keeps breaking off. My upper canine teeth are two completely different lengths and it looks ridiculous and it's made me even more self-conscious, because my lower canine on the right is slightly crooked and almost sideways (the only crooked teeth out of all my teeth), it grew in that way, and instead of my upper and lower canine teeth fitting side by side like most people, the tips hit each other.\nAny lengthening attempts have failed because I can't close my mouth properly once the upper canine is lengthened to match the left one, and like I said, the resin ends up just breaking off because of the constant impact.Would it be possible to get a veneer on that upper canine with this issue? Or do I need to get the lower canine straightened out? How would a dentist straighten one tooth out?

Can feel debris dropping on my gums and tongue . I need to swallow the saliva that was accumulating at the back of the throat and waited till she removed the tooth clamp and I rinsed my mouth after will all the filling out in the sink. During the time of the process I was swallowing my saliva to reduced the uncomfortable feeling and breathe through my mouth a few times. When I called the Dentist today the boss of the clinic claimed it is normal while filling up amalgam and the did not use the suction in fear of getting their tubes stuck with amalgam and dental dam might not be essential at this treatment . What preventive measures should Dentist use for this procedure to prevent injesting bits Is that true? .they also claimed not possible to swallow as gums and tongue are wet so it stuck to the gums and tongue .  Lol what an answer they provided. Should I go for a mercury test? MattKW: No, amalgam is an inorganic mercury compound that is not absorbed by the body. It's the inorganic compounds (e.g. ethylmercury, methylmercury) most commonly found in fish that cause mercury levels in your body. But you'd have to eat a lot of heavily contaminated fish. And the signs of acute mercury poisoning are not the vague crap you find on Google. Look up Minimata on Wiki if you really want to get scared.

But if enter my lungs as bits not vapor is it still hazardous? Busybee: If it had entered your lungs you'd have been choking at the time.   There is no vapour when you are putting in an amalgam filling.   The danger is meant to be when you are removing it.   So if you ever need to have it replaced make sure they use a dental dam. MattKW: Just to correct: I meant organic mercury compounds are the nasty ones, not the inorganic. A typo."

    "dialogue": "blowcake: I've been wondering about sugar intake in combination with brushing/rinsing teeth but don't know much about these topics myself, so here my question:For nutritional purposes (I'm a powerlifter) I add about 40g of dextrose to my protein shakes so I can comfortably hit the carbohydrates & calories I need each day. However, I'm a bit concerned about my teeth.Right now my oral hygiene looks like this:In the morning I brush my teeth, then have breakfast and drink a protein/dextrose shake. To my understanding, brushing my teeth before breakfast removes all (or most) bacteria that would otherwise immediately start metabolizing the sugars in my mouth. I rinse my mouth with water after breakfast, but don't brush my teeth again.\nThroughout the day I try to drink a lot. To my understanding, bacterial growth (and thus tooth decay) is minimal in this during the day, because of the higher flow of saliva - at least compared to the low production of saliva during sleep.\nIn the evening, right after dinner, I drink a second shake. About an hour after that I floss & brush my teeth before I go to bed.\nWhat is your opinion on dextrose intake and tooth decay and what would you change in regards to that about my oral hygiene?\nThanks in advance! lomo12: Hey I don't know about dextrose specifically (disclaimer: I'm not a dentist) but if you're worried about bacteria causing tooth decay you can try oil pulling with something like coconut oil after your evening shake perhaps. Basically you just swish it in your mouth like mouthwash. There have been studies that shows it helps reduce the amount of cavity causing bacteria in your mouth so maybe look into it. MattKW: OK, it's good you brush after the morning and evening shakes. You have to clear your mouth of the bacteria and sugars (including dextrose) . You don't mention what you specifically drink during the day; keep it to plain water, and stay away from any sugary drinks unless you're prepared to brush after each drink!"

My dentist told me my upper left back two molars had deep cavities, so I paid a lot of money out of pocket to have the filled. One by one the filling \"didnt take\" and I was in constant pain. I ended up getting them both extracted. Its been two full months now since I had it done and I still have constant pain there. I have numbness in my cheek and my nose on and off too. The gums hurt almost non stop and are super sensitive. It is definetely not dry socket as both healed up quickly. I switched dentists and she x rayed it and said theres no infection and it shouldnt be hurting. I rinse with salt water all the time and take excellent care of my mouth. I also flush my sinuses often as I get a lot of sinus pressure and always have. Is this just a matter of waiting for a few more months so the gums can heal or what do I do? I cannot put into words how annoying this is to constantly be in pain and have numbness. Any advice is more than appreciated, thank you in advance! Busybee: That must be so distressing.Perhaps you should try stopping the salt water for a few days.     The gums do best with just saliva and a healthy diet.   How is your bite since the extractions?   Are the teeth underneath touching the gums?    Some of what you describe can be caused by a dysfunctional bite.

That can cause pain and numbness as well as all sorts of uncomfortable sensations.  Think about getting a custom made night guard to wear so you don't grind in your sleep.   If you find yourself clenching, try to relax the jaw.   i'm just suggesting this because you need to rule it out as the cause.   If as you say you had relief from adjustments then it could be down to the sudden change.    But having adjustments doesn't really fix it because it's very hit and miss and the teeth start to try to meet in different places that set it all off again.   Do you floss every day?  If you had such large cavities it may be worth scheduling hygienist appointments every three months.   Get a good electric brush.

You just have to try different things and see if they help, try to relax the jaw, massage the jaw.     The other alternative is that the nerves were damaged when the teeth were pulled but you'd have to put an x ray up for the dentists to comment.

I went in last night for a cleaning and they confirmed no abscessed teeth no cavities that will cause me problems etc. The dentist seems to think its a combination of my sinuses putting pressure on the area that is healing as well as it takes a while to heal. She said can take up to 6 months to settle down. Im kind of worried there might be an infection or something, tough to not worry when this keeps happening, just want the pain to subside so I can stop thinking about it 24/7 Busybee: What you describe doesn't sound normal.  I am sure your dentist doesn't know what's happening.    Two months after an extraction is a long time to still be healing.   Do you have any x rays you could post of what was there before the extraction?How is wearing a night guard working out?  Ideally you should have one that is custom made by a dentist.    Have you tried relaxing the jaw?   It's pretty complicated to resolve such issues but worth trying different approaches and keeping a diary of when you have the most pain and what you were doing just before.    That might help identify triggers. Curtis1011: Busybee said:\t\t\tWhat you describe doesn't sound normal.  I am sure your dentist doesn't know what's happening.

Basically when I was 15-21 I wore braces and got them off, teeth were fine, then I did not take as good of care of them for many years. I never had so much as a toothache until I was 27 last year and randomly I started having almost unbearable pain. I went in to see a dentist and they told me my bottom right second from the back molar was abscessed and the back molar had a big cavity. They root canelled the tooth and fixed the cavity beside it (over 1600 out of pocket) and the pain never went away so 2 months later I got the tooth extracted. The pain STILL never went away so they said that I needed a root canal on the tooth in which I had a cavity filled, which I declined and said just pull it leaving me without the back two molars on the bottom right. Then I started having pain upper left literally the exact same situation with my back two molars (youd think I would learn my lesson) and a couple of thousand dollars later both those teeth are now out. As it stands now Im missing the bottom right back two molars and the top left back two molars, have 3 small and i mean small cavities and no other bad teeth. I decided to switch dentists went in for my new exam and a cleaning this week and they seemed a lot more thorough than the old dentist. She said originally the area should have healed by now but then she kind of changed it and said since I had two extractions it might take a whole longer. When I reach into my mouth and touch the top left gums they are not swollen but they definetely are sensitive to touch. I got those breath right strips to help breath better at night as well as got a mouthguard but nothing seems to help. No matter what I do on and off all day my left cheek and nose and even eyebrow area go numb and will sting really badly at times. Im pretty frustrated I think Ive spent just over 4k out of pocket in 8 months and havent gone any extended period of time without pain. My benefits kick in Nov 1st but I dont know what needs to be done since I dont know whats causing the pain. I could probably get my x rays will see what I can do. Thanks for all of the help I cant tell you how much I appreciate it Busybee: It does sound like the work you've done would knock your bite out of kilter.  So it's likely to be a combination of things.  Now I haven't had a molar extracted since I was a child, but I do recall for years the site was tickly when touched with the tongue or anything like floss etc.  Not painful but then someone else may have had pain where I had ticklyness.  Even know those areas although the gaps closed, the gum feels different.  I think the nerves retain a memory of the tooth when it's gone, maybe like ghost limbs etc.   Obviously you still have nerves and blood vessels going to that area and they used to feed a live tooth so it's likely that there will be some residual sensation.    I'm sure there's a term for that feeling.  A bit like if you've ever cut yourself in some accident when you were a kid and it was deep enough to go to the nerve.  When you feel that scar it can feel weird for years.   Not like the skin around it.  It's healed but it's not the same.  So it's likely to be a combination of this and the bite, but it's possible there is nerve damage.Hopefully it will all settle in time. It's one of those areas of medicine that has many \"experts\" but no solutions.By the way I had sinus problems years ago and I know those breathe right strips are a life saver.   Thankfully my problem was temporary and it only lasted so long because I was overdoing the nasal drops (otrivine).  I saw an ENT specialist and he gave me some different nose drops that cleared it all up in two days!  But it is really awful to have to go through sinus issues.  Getting a good night's sleep is such a challenge.  I can't imagine what you're going through with both that and dental pain.   Don't worry, this won't last forever.   It just feels that way for now, but you're out of balance. Maybe worth seeing an ENT specialist to check whether there is some damage to the sinus area.   It's all connected so whoever thought dentistry and ENT should be separated by an invisible wall should be discredited.

After seeing your post I kind of got thinking about the sinuses and I went to a doctor yesterday who said I have a pretty bad sinus infection on the side that has been hurting. He said its normal for that to cause tooth pain. I guess my ear was quite inflammed and I should have known as my nose and eye on that side only had been painful and leaking alot. I still think maybe 20-30 percent of the pain is from the gums healing after the extractions, Im a really slow healer apparently, but the doc put me on a special steroid nose spray and some antibiotics I had never heard of. I also had been using a nasal decongestant that he said to stop using as apparently they can do more harm than good when you over use them. Im hoping within a few days the meds kick in and things just improve. Im back in the dentist to get 2 small cavities filled at the end of the month but Im really hoping by then alot of the pressure subsides. Thanks sooooo much again for the help. It was your advice of seeing an ENT specialist that really got me thinking this might be sinus related. I still think I should see one and not just a GP doctor as I am prone to sinus issues, especially since my dad gets them a lot  and I have a deviated septum (broke my nose dirtbiking when I was 15). Thanks so much again, heres to hoping these meds help! Busybee: I'm glad I could help.  I do think it's worth seeing an ENT specialist.  One visit cured me.  What you've said about the nasal spray sounds so familiar.   Using that just makes the problem chronic.  They should put a warning on the bottles!  Please let us know how you get on."

Is there a risk-benefit analysis that needs to take place with respect to dental cleaning?  Specifically, my question is related to subgingival calculus and the removal thereof. This has a hardness that is comparable to cementum.  When it is removed, some cementum is also invariably removed.  If the thin cementum layer is completely removed, this exposes the dentinal tubules, allowing bacteria to enter the tubules more readily.  The literature seems to be unclear as to whether this can lead to pulpitis - but this is my concern.  Stated succinctly, can the removal of subgingival calculus actually increase the probability of pulpitis and the need for a root canal or tooth loss?I am hoping that the answer is no, but I cannot seem to see this addressed directly.

I could of sworn many years ago my gums were not like this and were 100% pink and thicker. people or fam have told me that my red swollen gums are do to age and my mom also has this problem. the red gums could be inflammation or a mix of inflammation and age, I really have no clue and I eat very healthy and eat mostly non gmo foods/drinks, brush me teeth twice a day, floss once before bed, I don't drink or smoke at all, no bad drugs, no candy, no fast food, no starches, no cane sugar, no high fructose corn syrup, no pizza or junk food either. WHAT is causing my gum issue? and how do I cure this gum problem all the way and NEVER have this gum issue again? can doing what this man is talking about cure my gum problem?>>> Busybee: If your mother has the same problem it's likely to be inherited.  It sounds like you're doing all the right things by going to the dentist for regular cleans and eating healthy.  If your dentist is happy with your gums why are you worried? pearly whites: @Busy bee, because of the problem I mentioned above about both my bottom and top gums being half healthy/pink while the other half's of my gums are red/swollen and thinner. The man in the youtube video I posted had the same problem and claimed what he did cured the gum problem I mentioned above so I want to know if I could do what he did if its lagit or have another option to fix my gum problem. my mom has it as well as me  however I think its possible the reason why we have that gum problem is not do to inheritance and I base that on the mans video I posted since he was able to cure that problem. I don't care if my dentist is happy with my gums, its not his teeth/gums, its my body and I own it so I can do with it what I want. I do have pictures of this gum problem so I can post them here if you like so you can better understand what I am talking about however its kind of a pain in the but to do that witch is why I did not post them at all. Busybee: My view is that anything that says it's 100% guaranteed on the internet is likely to be a tad suspect.   But if your dentist is happy with your gums then that is a good sign.  Maybe you could post a photo of your gums for the dentists here? pearly whites: Busybee said:\t\t\tMy view is that anything that says it's 100% guaranteed on the internet is likely to be a tad suspect.

I know 99% of the stuff out there on the subject or for example: exercise is false or a fraud and because of that the stuff that works is difficult to find and so people will not bother to search for what works as they think its all bs so I can see how you would think its just another scam. Here is pics of the gum problem I was talking about Busybee: By all means wait for the dentists' opinions, but I think this looks like it's the colour of your gums,   As in some people have different levels of skin pigmentation.  For example I've just checked my own mouth (and I must say I've never bothered to look at this area) and yes it's darker colour at the bottom in my mouth too.  Perhaps it's something to do with a higher concentration of blood vessels.   I actually find it really hard to see that high up because I really had to pull my lip up.  Yes mine are thin too.  You are IMO focusing on something that isn't a problem but perfectly normal.   But I do hope some of the dentists here reassure you. Busybee: By the way I don't think it's a good idea to go poking about in that area.   Best not to touch the inside of your mouth with your fingers and leave it to the dentist to examine.  I'm saying this because my mouth feels funny now I've been touching an area I never go near with the tooth brush!  It feels like I've hit my funny bone on my elbow."

    "dialogue": "John Anthony: Hi all, newbie here.  I'm a 71 year old guy with several broken teeth.  I've had a marginally successful small business for 30 years with no dental insurance, so there wasn't much I could do as my old fillings broke apart.  I've been semi retired since 2014, on Medicare with HMO Delta Care USA.I recently had Delta send me the Schedule of Benefits for my plan.  It's pretty good, actually.  I have a few $K to blow on my teeth so I went in for a consultation with a local dentist that accepts my plan.He worked up a 5 phase plan with 9 crowns, two lateral veneers, a removable partial, and a couple resin based comps.  His fee totals $29,600, my cost would be $8735.He wants to do porcelain to high noble metal on all the crowns, procedure D2750.  His fee for that is $1646, my cost on each is $295, plus $150 \"lab fee\", plus $150 \"zirconia material fee\".  I put them in quotes because I think these are B.S. fees.Several teeth he has $150 \"core buildup including pins fee\".  The procedure is D2950, which is covered by my plan.  Either his assistant made an honest mistake, or they didn't think I would look it up.In total, these 25 charges add up to $3750.  Removing those would get me below $5k.  Don't know if he will move on that.It turns out that one of my customers has had a dental lab in New Jersey for 44 years.  He says he makes crowns, etc for high end dentists in Manhattan.  He would like to do me a favor and make emax crowns, the veneers, and a fixed bridge for me for like $3k total.  He says all he needs is the full impression after tooth prep.He says ask the dentist if he will settle for what the insurance pays, total of $20,856, and let me pay him out of pocket to make everything for me.  He says the dentist won't like it, but he'll be losing close to $21k if I walk.  He says if this dentist doesn't go for it, I should be able to find someone in SoCal that will do it. I checked with Delta and they said sounds like a good deal, but he's not in the network, and can't go to a lab out of state.I would appreciate any advice.  Thanks very much. Busybee: Perhaps you don't need quite so much work?  Is there another dentist you can see that also covers your insurance plan? John Anthony: Busybee said:\t\t\tPerhaps you don't need quite so much work?  Is there another dentist you can see that also covers your insurance plan?\n\t\t\nClick to expand... Busybee: Hi did you mean to reply? John Anthony: Oh no, I need all  that work.  Several teeth are broken down to the nub, with just one side remaining, plus one of my front teeth is descending due to bone loss and will have to come out.Tooth #15 needs a root canal but I'm putting that off for now, at least until the antibiotics wear off.  It's also broken off on three sides.  My wife says just get it pulled.  The root canal is covered but the endodontist says there will be about $450 in extra charges, so saving that tooth will cost $1150 with the crown.  I asked the dentist to pull it but he wanted me to visit the specialist first.  I told him I only have $5K to spend and this tooth alone will eat up 20% of that, he looked at me like \"so?\"How much time does it take the dentist to prep a tooth for a crown?  Just trying to figure out how much of his $1646 fee is labor vs what he budgets for the crown.  My cost for porcelain to high noble is $295.  I know the $150 lab and $150 zirconia material charges are bogus.My friend said he uses 89% gold plus 11% palladium.  Or platinum, can't remember which.  He said \"high noble\" metal can mean as little as 10% gold.  So the dentist's actual cost can vary a lot.This dentist is 5 minutes away, just around the corner.  They did give me a referral to another dentist in the network that may be lower cost, but I want to try bargaining with this one first.  I know he's good.  Just a crook. Busybee: Preparation time depends on complexity.  It's usually about an hour to an hour and a half with the temp.   As well as his time, the crown material, lab costs etc,  his fee will include a portion of his overheads for rent, equipment, utilities, staff etc.    I'm not sure if it's still the case but zirconia used to have to be cut in a special way.   But I don't think it makes it more expensive at least not in the UK.  I think if you know the dentist is good and so conveniently five minutes away if anything goes wrong, then I'd value that above cost of work.Dentists have close working relations & communication with their technicians so your dentist may not want to use someone else or just rely on them to guess what's required for your particular issues.  They will have agreed tariffs and all sorts of arrangements in place with the one they use more often.   Don't forget that your customer is out to make money too.    If you insist the dentist uses that lab and something goes wrong because of the technician's work, then where would that leave you?   You could fall out with both the dentist and your customer.   Seems more than a bit risky because the dentist tells the technician what is required and sends it back if it's not good enough. How will you do that with a customer?  I'd steer clear of that but obviously up to you. John Anthony: Busybee said:\t\t\tPreparation time depends on complexity.  It's usually about an hour to an hour and a half with the temp.

That's quite a while in the chair, and I understand he needs to get paid for his skill and it must cover his operating expenses.My customer and I were thinking no temp crowns, just prep the teeth.  I could live on beans and rice for a week or so while he makes the crowns.  He says all he needs is a full mouth impression.  And he said, \"tell him not to skimp on the material\".  He said he can't understand why some dentists send him \"just barely there\" impressions, like the material is precious, when it's just a few dollars.He says the $150 fee for \"zirconia material\" is nonsense.  You have either a porcelain to metal crown, or you have a zirconia crown.  You don't add zirconia material to a PFM crown.He says the $150 lab fee is just padding the bill.  The technician's fee to make the crown is the fee.  The technician doesn't add a separate lab fee.Yes, my guy is not giving it away.  He's charging me the same as he would charge a dentist, about $3k for emax, vs porcelain to high noble.I think the dentist is very good but I object to being gouged.  If I had the money I wouldn't even look at the bill, but I can't afford what he wants. Busybee: No temp crowns sounds crazy.    Your customer doesn't know how a dentist runs a business and you don't know how much he charges the dentist.  There's no way to tell whether he's telling you the truth.  This is a really unwise course you are thinking of taking.   All I can see is risks for you and avoidance of liability by those you would be paying.   I don't know what kind of laws you have governing this in the US but either they are not sufficiently robust to protect the patient, or your customer is breaking them.  I'd steer clear of the customer.   This is unethical.Ask the customer what kind of contract he is proposing to write to cover liability etc.   What will he do if the crowns don't fit etc. John Anthony: Busybee said:\t\t\tNo temp crowns sounds crazy.

My Mother lives in Yuma, AZ half the year, and said lots of snow-birds go across the border to get their dental work done in Mexico for one third the cost.  He said don't do that, I'll come up with a plan.  I told him I didn't have much to spend.A couple of days later his receptionist gave me the proposed plan, of which my end is nearly $9K.  My initial thought was, not bad but still double my budget.I looked at my schedule of benefits and saw there were a couple crown types that were no cost to me, so I asked if we could use one of those types instead of porcelain fuzed to high noble metal.  He said our lab doesn't do those.Then I remembered that twenty years ago, one of my customers told me he had a dental lab and made crowns.  I called him to ask about the different types of crowns.  Then I asked if he would look over my paperwork.  I emailed him my x rays, photos, the proposed treatment plan, and my schedule of insurance benefits.Right away he asked what are all these lab fees?  And what are these charges for zirconia material?  You either have PFM or zirconia, but not both.  So right away we knew the dentist is padding the bill by $3750.  He started brain storming, and said I can do all your work for less than that.  Just have the dentist prep your teeth, send me the impressions, and I'll send  you the finished crowns.  I've never met him, he lives in New Jersey and I've never seen his work.  I just know what he's told me.  But I know a lot more now about my dentist, and I don't like it.So that's where we are.  Just talking about it.  I haven't been back to the dentist to go over the charges with him yet.  The last time I was there, I asked him to pull #15.  He refused, saying I want you to see a specialist.  We can save that tooth.  It was at that point I told him I have $5K to spend, and saving this tooth would eat up 20% of my budget.  And he gave me the wide-eyed \"so?\" expression, shaking his head.Most root canals are fully covered in my plan, but after consultation, the specialist said there would be $400 in uncovered charges, so I got out of the chair and left.  I'll go back to my dentist when the antibiotics wear off and it starts hurting again, and have it pulled. Busybee: John, I have porcelain fused to zirconium crowns.  So they definitely make them.     Maybe your customer doesn't do them just like your dentist's lab doesn't do other crowns.   If you don't trust your dentist go to another dentist, but don't try to make deals directly with a lab to try to cut the price.  You will end up regretting it.  You have no idea of the quality of his work and it appears you haven't discussed any form of contract.  It is always better to save a tooth than pull it.  $400 is not a big excess to try to save a tooth.  A tooth that is saved by a good specialist and left in situ is priceless.   But I'm sure you can find a dentist who will pull it for you.  Go back to your dentist and ask if there is any way to reduce the cost without affecting the outcome.   Bear in mind though that a good dentist is worth the money."

    "dialogue": "CMO: Greetings all,This is my first post. I will try to be brief with my question. I avoided visiting a dentist for 15-20 years due to an auditory problem.  I finally decided to see a dentist last year because of a brief episode of gum pain.  He did a full series of x-rays and (to his surprise) found no bone loss. (I brush 2X/day and floss.) In any case, he signed me up for a \"prophylactic cleaning\" to be done in two appointments (half of mouth each time). I was told this \"is not a root planing.\"Two weeks ago, I went through the first appointment.  It want OK, but there was a lot of tartar removal needed (some supragingival and some subgingival).  I asked the hygienist to use only manual tools. My question is this; in addition to some extra sensitivity to cold food/beverages, I have noticed that there is sort-of a dull background pain that comes and goes (and moves around) on the side that was cleaned.  is this normal? Could this be related to the sensitivity to cold?  It is present even when I am doing nothing. Busybee: Well done on finally making it to the dentist. It's normal to have some sensitivity after a clean and if you had a lot of tartar then over the years the gum may have receded a bit & the enamel eroded which can cause sensitivity after cleaning.   Use a sensitive toothpaste or they can put some fluoride paste on it at the surgery.  It can take a few weeks for sensitivity to go.  You may need a small filling somewhere but the dentist will wait and watch the area before diving in as it usually goes away.   Just mention it at the next appointment."

    "title": "Permanent Bridge, Temporary Cement, and Oral Implants question",
    "dialogue": "Will Geisler: I have a permanent bridge permanent cemented over my lower front teeth. Since the placement, the bridge is uncomfortable, irritating my gums, and causing a lisp. I am having the bridge completely redone next week (by the same doctor) to eliminate some of the bulk from the labial side for the purpose of improving the comfort and fit. In July, I am considering an beginning the process to have an oral implant placed (with the two adjacent teeth crowned) in that area as an alternative to having the bridge. The hope is the implant will be more comfortable, and that I will have an easier time keep the area clean First, a bone graft will be needed (5-6 month recovery), then the implant screw placement (2-3 month recovery, then the tooth placement and two adjacent crowns placement. The oral surgeon is recommending that when I have the bridge replaced I should use temporary cement instead of permanent cement. This is so the oral surgeon can take it off for the bone graft and take it off again for the implant screw. I am concerned that the temporary cement may cause the bridge to fall out during the 8 months or so it will be in use. Your thoughts? Busybee: They can do pretty strong temp cement.  It just means they have to wrestle a bit to remove it.  If the fit of the bridge is good it should not fall off.  If it does fall off then they need to look at the fit.  Obviously you have to be more careful if it's temporary cement but you should still be able to eat most things.   The alternative is that they do a temp bridge.  That can also fall off but they can put on much stronger cement as they won't be worried about drilling it off if necessary to remove it later. MattKW: Since you've already had a bridge done, I don't see there is any advantage by doing an implant. An implant will be harder to keep clean, and more likely to fail compared to the bridge. If the bridge was too thick labially, then the crowns would normally be about the same thickness, so see how you dentist goes with the new bridge. When he tries it in for fit, don't let him cement it if it's still too thick - he can always cut some back and have it reglazed. Even the temporary bridge he gives you between appointments should be close to the correct thickness and feel good. Photos of your current bridge from the front and above would be helpful to see."

Like something that really happens and can help? have u heard of it? MattKW: You seem to have had an apicocectomy. These can work OK if done by a very experienced dentist or an endodontist, but would not be my first choice of treatment as they bring in greater risks of failure.

    "dialogue": "Noodle24: In the last week or two i've started to get a dull toothache in a tooth that's had a RCT many years ago that's remained constant. After seeing my dentist he undertook an X ray of the tooth (Bottom Left furthest Molar) and saw a small black shadow which he said could be infection or inflammation. He recommended the tooth would need removing in future but insisted that it wasn't a problem right now. The filling on the top of this tooth did chip a few months ago when the tooth next to it was removed.It has since been repaired.This is where i get concerned. I am due to go abroad to Italy for a week in just 10 days time. I shall be going with a lot of friends and family to celebrate my 30th. I explained this to my dentist who said that unfortunately it was just a case of leaving the tooth and hoping it didn't get too painful, no antibiotics prescribed. I'm very anxious about this problem getting worse over the next 2 weeks.My questions are:\nShould i just go on holiday and hope the infection doesn't get too bad (if it is that) or should i push for antibiotics?\nCould the small black spot at the bottom of my root be anything other than infection? Busybee: Noodle you're only going for a week and the worst case scenario you can see a dentist as an emergency while you are in italy.  I was in Italy with someone who had a problem with a tooth a couple of years ago and even though we were in a remote location she was taken to see a dentist in town and they did really help her.  Try not to worry, there are good dentists there too.  Make sure you have insurance.  Take ibuprofen with you just in case.  But it could be that the dental work you had is a bit too high and it's making the tooth more tender or \"bruised\".   Could be your bite after having an extraction has shifted too much pressure there.   There could be other factors. A dentist saying it \"could be infection\" doesn't meant it's an infection.  See another dentist for an opinion.   There's no point taking antibiotics if there is no definite infection, in fact it's a risk to take meds for no reason.  I've had experience twice of being told I have an infection which turns out to be nothing.  Always worth it to see more than one dentist about that.  If your dentist was sure then you'd have been prescribed meds.  It's not always that obvious in the early stages.  See another dentist for an opinion before you go just to put your mind at rest.    A second opinion doesn't cost much. Noodle24: Thanks Busybee, I guess i just let anxiety get the better of me. I spent the best part of £1k trying to save the tooth next to this one which ultimately got a bad infection and came out. Just wanted to mitigate the chances of this happening again over the next few weeks as much as possible."

The gum specialist kept saying my teeth are not that  bad. Same with the dentist. But at the same time he says I should just skip the deep cleaning including planing and scaling, and go straight to flap surgery. I feel like the information is contradicting, my gums are \"not bad\" but then I have to go for the most invasive procedure? Is it unusual for someone to skip deep cleaning with planing and scaling and go straight to flap surgery?The gum specialist says that the reason he wants to do the flap surgery is because deep cleaning is not effective enough. He says it could miss a spot of tartar and then the bacteria could grow underneath without me knowing ie: the outer gums will look great but then inside could have bacterial growth. It will be a false indicator of my gum health. Have any of you people with 6mm pockets have just have deep cleaning (scaling and planning) and found this is good enough? Ie: what is the long term effectiveness of just this deep cleaning (5 years)? Do you find that the majority of the patients who do a deep cleaning end up having to do flap surgery in the end?

I'm having the same problem.Did you end up having the flap surgery?Thanks for any help, Uptown101: The flap procedure is necessary when severe gum disease (periodontitis) has damaged the bones that support your teeth. Healthy pockets  typically  measures  1-3 millimeters and it  may require some type of periodontal disease treatment.  Pocket depths that are deeper than  6 mm are usually an indication of more advanced gum disease.  You may need surgery for severe gum disease (periodontitis)  and it was called Flap Surgery.  A flap procedure cleans the roots of a tooth and repairs bone damage caused by a gum disease. The doctor will pull back a section of your gums to clean the roots of your teeth and repair damaged bone. Typically it takes only a few days to recover from a flap procedure.

There are always risks with any dental work but if you go to a good dentist they should do their best to minimise these. You obviously have to look after hygiene when you have such work.   The main thing is don't go for cheap and attractive special offers as you may end up paying double fixing mistakes.    Do your research on a good specialist. Athethos: Yup, what Busybee said, implants are pricey, but there are ways to fill multiple empty sockets without having to install the implants one at the time. Afterwards, it's a matter of using a special toothpaste for this kind of fillings. Admittedly, there's nothing to be scared of, if you can afford it."

    "title": "Unknown Pain - Advice Please",
    "dialogue": "Stephen80: Hi All, My first post, and to explain everything that's going on will probably take a while, so please bear with me. I visited the dentist in mid-February with shooting pain in what I thought was my lower back right molar (#7). The NHS dentist said there was a crack in the tooth and booked an appointment for the end of March. On March 5th, the pain worsened, so I had an emergency appointment on March 7th. The NHS dentist found the crack was in #6, not #7, and took an X-ray revealing my wisdom tooth was impacted and rotting #7. I saw a surgeon on March 9th who thought the wisdom tooth wasn’t the issue but identified decay in #6, diagnosing irreversible pulpitis. I saw a private dentist on March 13th, who did a deep filling on #6 and suggested the wisdom tooth might be a problem. I’m still experiencing discomfort in my cheekbone and tenderness under my lower right teeth. I’m considering a second opinion. Busybee: You’re getting conflicting opinions. Request all dental records from your NHS practice. Find a good dentist and get them to review your situation and provide a second opinion. Don’t rush into any work without different viewpoints. Your wisdom tooth might affect the root of the adjacent tooth. Complain about the NHS dentist and consider getting a report from another dentist. Stephen80: Thanks for the advice. The crack was in #6, and the NHS dentist didn’t catch it. I was charged £73 and £109 for the fillings. I’m concerned about having no.7 removed if it’s not necessary. Busybee: It seems they count teeth from the middle outwards, so #6 and #7 might be referred to differently in the UK. Make sure to get a second opinion. Stephen80: The private dentist said #6 had deep decay and gave a deeper filling. I’ve paid over £180 so far and will need a root canal costing about £350. I hope it goes well. Busybee: I hope it works out with the new dentist. Good to hear you’re feeling better. Keep us updated. Stephen80: I had the root canal procedure, which was painful, but the dentist said the overfill of GP is inert and won’t be a problem. He confirmed I need a crown but not urgently. Busybee: Was this a specialist endodontist? Usually, a crowned tooth is better protected. The GP going past the root tip might cause sensitivity, but if you’re feeling better, it’s likely tolerable. MattKW: The GP overfill might be tolerated by the body. A crown helps protect the tooth; some dentists wait to place it until healing is complete. If you have issues, return sooner. Stephen80: My tooth feels better, with occasional pain when chewing. I still have some ear blockage. I’m wary of needing a crown and want to wait it out. Busybee: Avoid chewing hard foods. If you experience more symptoms, you might need antibiotics. The abscess should heal on its own. A crown helps protect the tooth from future issues. Numbness in the lip should pass. Stephen80: I’m not in pain anymore. The sore throat and ear issues are easing. The numbness in my lip is occasional and might be psychosomatic. I plan to wait for the crown and will see my dentist for further advice. Busybee: Glad to hear you’re not in pain. Be cautious with your tooth until you get the crown. The numbness should pass. Consult your dentist if any issues arise."

Does this look like oral cancer? Robin Pandey: I am not a dentist and honestly I think it's nothing.. If there is no emergency and you are not in pain then I would ask you to wait for 2-3 weeks and then consult the doctor if the area hasn't healed.. Uptown101: Yeah you don't have to panic as long as you're not in pain, Just wait for a couple of days or weeks, if it's still there maybe you should consult your dentist. aqz: Thank you all for your kind words.

I am a mouth breather and always wake up with dry mouth i dont know if that had something to do with it? aqz: I am a smoker which i know dont help in healing Busybee: Well it's thought saliva promotes healing but you can't control how you sleep.   Of course smoking clogs up your blood stream with poisons your body doesn't need and stops your mouth getting as much oxygen and good things which keep everything in there healthy.   It's a bit like sucking on a car exhaust pipe and hoping to feel good.  But it's looking a lot better than a week ago.  How does it feel? aqz: @Busybee  really? You think it looks better? Looks the same to me and there is no pain as such just a lil uncomfortable at times. I dont know i will just have to see how it goes i guess. Busybee: It definitely looks much better than when you first posted.  It will heal in time but you should stop smoking, not just for the sake of your mouth but your overall health.    I used to get mouth ulcers when I smoked, but never since I gave up.   It's just bad for everything and especially your wallet. aqz: @BusybeeThank you for your kind words and advice.

I don't know much about cost but I believe they are wayyyy overcharging me for the work done. Is this true and if it is what can I do to get it lowered. Small claims? Busybee: What country are you in? Either you added a zero, or you live in a remote outpost where the dentist has to fly in by chartered plane or you live in a country where the currency is very weak. Devin M.: In the U.S. I'm in Michigan living in a big city. And yea $5,700. Idk if I should take them to small claims if it's worth it. Busybee: It's pretty ridiculous, but you should always ask for a quote before you agree to treatment.  In the UK the practice is meant to give you a treatment plan and be clear on charges, but patients don't always bother to push for this when they are in pain and distress. It's really up to the profession to police bad practice because it taints all dentists if one is a rip off merchant. Busybee: by the way you can't really take them to small claims if these rates are advertised on a website or in their practice.  They will say you should have asked how much it would cost.  So you may be able to make some claim but they would have a strong counter argument that you didn't ask for the cost. Devin M.: Ok thanks, i made sure to ask about what the total cost would be and some of the charges were not in the paperwork that I signed and agreed on. I keep getting random bills of additional fees so I think I'll call a lawyer to see what they have to say Busybee: Have you asked them why they keep sending you bills?   I don't know what the law is on such matters over there, but in the UK there are various consumer laws that stop this sort of thing happening.  You pay at the end of treatment, usually with a deposit part way through if treatment is in two or more stages.  You don't keep getting bills once treatment has finished."

It can be very sore for a few days but then it's like it never happened.  I don't know what colour it would be if live, but I'm sure there's nothing that can't wait until you see the dentist on tuesday.

For the past three years I've been getting opinions on how to correct it, all of which cost 10-15k.A cosmetic dentist wanted to crown all my back teeth (16) with emax. This wouldn't even address my open bite. My current dentist wants to build up the front first so my teeth can guide properly, and then work on the back. I recently had a filling break and become a root canal, which got me thinking about the 8-10 other similar fillings I have, all of which might have the same thing happen. This teeth twist me up and pre-occupy my thoughts and are costing me a small fortune, and they don't even look good. I'll probably spend between 10-20k to get the bite corrected (if that works), and then after that I'll be constantly replacing crowns for the rest of my life.

If you have veneers that means more tooth material would need to be removed so you risk compromising the health of the tooth.  The other alternative is orthodontics which is expensive, carries its own risks (see root resorption) and means you have to wear retainers every night the rest of your days.   The fourth option is \"do nothing\".  Your teeth look cute the way they are.  This is you and unless they are uncomfortable or your jaw hurts I'd leave them as is.  Too many people want to change things that give their appearance character.   Once dentists start fiddling with your teeth to make them look nice you end up with other issues.  It's ok when you're a child and it's all still growing, but once you're an adult it's not so simple.  Plus anything you have done now could be upset by the eruption of your wisdom teeth. MattKW: It's too deep for composite buildup without making a nasty plaque trap that could lead to decay between your teeth, plus the way you bite would probably be an interference. Orthodontically would be best way, and you could ask about simply fixing this one area of concern rather than full upper and lower braces. And wisdom teeth have no effect on front teeth - common myth, not supported by studies. Busybee: Wisdom teeth closed my gaps from three extractions.   Had I not had those spaces they would either have impacted or I'd have crooked teeth.   I remember being able to stick my tongue in a gap as a teen.   The trouble with studies is that every jaw is different, everyone has different dentition and there are just too many variables.    But I reckon that in the UK any dentist not trying to sell invisilgn would try to persuade a patient to have veneers/crowns for this problem.  I would say leave it be  - there is nothing as strong as a normal, healthy natural tooth. MattKW: No, your anecdotal evidence contradicts the studies. In your early teens, the canine teeth drop into place and the common midline diastema automatically closes. Plus, all teeth have a tendency to move forward during life - it's the mechanics of the jaw. A case arose a few years ago where the OS in question removed the wisdom teeth for a patient to \"stop crowding at the front\". Only problem was that the patient suffered nerve damage, and since the dentist couldn't justify the extractions for his purported reason, he lost the subsequent lawsuit. Crowns or veneers (or Invisalign) will not fix this problem, and you have no experience with these issues. Zuri Barniv: MattKW said:\t\t\tNo, your anecdotal evidence contradicts the studies.

Zuri Barniv: I've been on here for a few years now, you would be the first one....sadly. Busybee: As I said, I think the OP shouldn't do anything, this sort of imperfection adds character to the face and looks natural and there's no replacing natural tooth material.  Maybe I'm wrong about wisdom teeth affecting front teeth, but in my case a canine rotated after wisdom teeth erupted.   It's interesting about the court case, but scientific studies are just observations that have not yet been contradicted with different observations.    Dental studies of this type must be pretty cumbersome to execute and require a long term commitment.   Do you have a reference to the study in the court case? Godbotz: Hi guys i just got notified people actualy responded to my thread and you guys making me freak out i didn't know my case is that bad omg.... MattKW: You might think that Godbotz doesn't need to do anything, but he is feeling insecure and wants suggestions. When you get lots of scientific studies supporting the same conclusions, you have a consensus that develop into guidelines. It takes more than a single case to overthrow the weight of the other studies. And there are lots of ways studies can be conducted, some are better than others, and carry more weight, e.g. prospective Vs retrospective. Who cares how long these things take or how cumbersome they are? If we only relied on what \"we\" thought was right, I'd still think the Earth was flat. I can't remember any details of the court case, nor find it on Google - just keep getting malpractice lawyers toting for business. MattKW: Welcome back. In essence, take my advice from 10:34am posting. Best wishes."

My insurance provider like many others say they do not cover implants, yet no one at my provider can tell me what the following statements mean that I found under my Fee Schedule's codes:\"autogenous connective tissue graft procedure, per first tooth, implant or endentulous tooth position in graft\" and another that states:\"autogenous connective tissue graft procedure - each additional contiguous tooth, implant or edentulous tooth\"Of course just wishing, hoping here, but thought I should ask. Thanks for any help. MattKW: Autogenous (your own); connective tissue (supporting skin); graft (well, graft); per first tooth... (for first tooth or implant, or missing tooth). The second phrase is almost the same, but contiguous means for next-door teeth, implant, or missing tooth position. They usually pay a higher amount for the first graft, then a lower amount (a step-down) for a graft that is bigger and goes to adjacent spaces. Autogenous just means they've taken it from somewhere else in your body."

I am so stressed out that it serious becouse i went to dentist and he gave difflam which i sprayed for over a week now the pain is gone but this redness is still there. I went today and saw another dentist and she just says it looks like i scrapped it etc. But to wait for a few more weeks and if still there then will refer me to hospital. This has sent my mind and anxiety to another level. I am just so down, i just got back from gp and she said it looks like nothing serious and dont seem concerned. What should i do? And has anyone else been in a similar situation. Any advice will be much appreciated. Thanks Busybee: I had something like this about ten years ago.  I burned the area with some hot tomato soup.  In my case it became infected when I went swimming and I was in a lot of pain because it was right over a salivary gland opening.  I ended up with an infection that needed antibiotics.   Yours isn't over a salivary gland as they are more towards the back.  You should stop picking and prodding it and it should heal naturally.   I always take extra vit C if I have anything like this in the mouth, which thankfully I haven't for a long time.   If you smoke, don't for a few days.  If it gets worse, which from what you say isn't happening, then you'd need antibiotics but it sounds as though it's healing because it's stopped hurting you.   btw don't take this the wrong way, I'm not a dentist but you really should go for a hygiene appointment. aqz: @Busybee  thank you so much for your reply really appreciate it. To be honest i thought redness would go by now but my anxiety is just all over the place i keep checking it and taking pics with phone. Dentist did say if not gone in few weeks will refer me to hosp for further tests this is what is causing me severe anxiety i suffer with health anxiety. Its ok i know i need to have a clean up as i do smoke i know i shouldnt just want to feel normal again. Thanks for your advice. ☺ Busybee: Hi aqz you should relax and let it heal.  It just looks like an injury and maybe try to eat soft foods for a few days that aren't too acidic.   But if you care about your health you really should stop smoking, it's so bad for your oral health and will make you more prone to ulcers which will take longer to heal.  It also affects your gums.  Believe me I gave up many years ago and the difference is astonishing. aqz: @Busybee thank you so much for your kind and reassuring words, i hope it is just a thing that will heal. As i dont feel pain or discomfort that is what concerns me and its been there nearly two weeks. I will add i do eat alot of crunchy and spicy things. So thought maybe that has something to do with it. But who knows how long its been there as i only noticed when i started looking with my torch and camera. Health anxiety is just a vicious cycle! aqz: @Busybee would be so greatful if a dentist or oral surgeon can have a look and give their opinion. ☺ aqz: @drmins please could you kindly look and give your opinion.Many thanks"

    "dialogue": "Arealperson: Hi,\nI've spent time trying to form these questions so I could get a response. So, thanks in advance. I've also tried to keep it on point or it would be a book.Overview:\nThis extraction was on #31 (#30 and #32 were previously pulled years ago). I’ve never had any issues with any extractions. This is concerning a complex extraction by my new career Dentist (25+ years) (a non OS) on the first visit. 98% of the tooth was removed. The top of the tooth snapped off at the very start of the extraction process with the Dentist continuing. The process took 45 mins. This extraction was a needed maintenance extraction, there was no pain in the tooth, there was no infection. And, no explanation was given by the dentist as to why the extraction was performed the way it was. Scenario:\nMy #31 complex molar extraction.After the 45min. extraction, I was given stitches over the gum area of #30 and told to be careful not to spit the blood clot out. This was a joke as the entire socket had been cut out in a “V” shape and there was no socket or area to produce a blood clot (Much tissue was removed on top and sides from 30 - 32). Only the exposed white bone over a three tooth area. Also, all the gums over this 3 tooth area had been pretty much stripped off and removed via suction. The dentist had created a “V” shaped Jack O'Lantern cut (the correct term is unknown) in order to remove the molar.After about 3 months, the healing seemed to stop. And every sense (its been about 6 months now) I’ve have very little feeling (some feeling remains) in that lower quadrant of my mouth. It’s sensitive in that area also, and I have pain, kinda like a toothache also. Tissue has finally covered the area(s) but it feels like a goose egg in my mouth (Like only part of the novocaine wore off). Also the Sublingual Space of my cheek/mouth was opened and remained open for a long time.I’ve had a hard time getting answers on my questions. If you feel the questions are to vague or whatever, please just answer them on their own level of abstraction, the best you can, and provide your assumptions.Questions: (Some may seem redundant, but please, try to answer if in anyway you can.)1) Is the V” shaped Jack O'Lantern cut (correct term unknown), a type of valid or approved method, procedure or technique that is taught in dental school ? If yes, can you explain ?2) Is the “V” cut accepted as a practice for Dentist in extracting a molar but is not specificity taught as a method, procedure or technique (or other). Please explain if you can ?3) What is the criteria (if any) for determining when a patient should be sent to an OS (Oral Surgeon) ? This question asked within the scope of the scenario.4) On the actual extraction itself (removal of the tooth). Can a dentist (non OS) generally choose/do whatever they want, OR, are they required to use specific approved procedures.?  Example, just cut the tooth out, you should try to be careful, maybe use this procedure if you can (or want to), but the way you choose to remove it, is up to you as a dentist.5) Is there a specific method, procedure or technique to perform Sectioning during a complex extraction ? If yes, what is it ?I’ve been suffering, and it’s really been hard to get answers.\nSo if you can, please have pity on me and try to answer and/or help, because, I’m suffering and need some answers.Thank You for your help,\nArealperson MattKW: 1. Hard to say what you're trying to describe. It is not unusual to \"raise a flap\" with \"relieving incisions\" into sulcus for a surgical extraction.\n2. Again, not sure what you had done, just guessing.\n3. No specific criteria; some general dentists are just more experienced than others and will do all themselves. Others refer at first sign of trouble. Others get into trouble (maybe unexpected), and then refer to OS to complete treatment.\n4.Different methods can be used. Some methods might be judged better than others, but some techniques are preferred by dentist due to experience. There are some basic surgical do's and don't's in flap design to ensure minimal damage.\n5. Again, \"different strokes, different folks\". The end result is the main aim, as long as basic principles are applied, and no unreasonable treatment is undertaken.\nIf you're not sure about degree of healing, go back to dentist and ask questions, and perhaps ask for referral to OS for higher opinion.

On the jaw cross section I've colored it red so you can see it.\nThe cut is deep and flush with the bottom of my mouth.If you used this pattern around the whole mouth it would be a classic Jack O'Lantern pattern\nThats what I meant in my question. \n-----------------------\nQuestion 3 \n\"some general dentists are just more experienced than others and will do all themselves\"\nSo your saying that a general dentist can legally preform any or most, or some surgical procedures.. as in.. \"will do all themselves\"  ?They will do a surgery they feel they can ? That seems illegal to me. Is it ? Am I correct ? Or did I missunderstand.\n-----------------------I may be misunderstanding, so in the U.S, As long as a general dentist feels the can do an oral surgery\nthey may legally do it ?\n---------------------------------------------------------Thanks for your answers, MattKW: I'm not from the US, hence I'm not a Halloween follower and the sawtooth didn't make sense to me. \n1. and 2. It's still not possible to understand quite what you're talking about, as you don't have a post-op pic. That said, it is not always possible to close a flap up completely after an extraction - it would be ideal, because this would be healing by \"primary intention\", but quite a lot of dentistry healing is by \"secondary intention\". \n3. I don't know quite the situation in US, but it's prob similar to here in Australia. There is no single point at which a dentist needs to refer to an OS; all dentists are qualified to do oral surgery. When I worked in a country area, I did more oral surgery. Now that I in a city, I have access to an OS down the street, I choose to give him most of my difficult cases. Why should I try and do everything as a general dentist when he's doing OS all day, every day, and has a better setup? It's similar to Root Canal Therapy - all dentists are trained, some are better than others, some prefer and actively do more than others, and some refer all cases to specialists."

    "dialogue": "Crackedtoothguy: Hello Everyone,First time poster from Toronto and I'm at a loss trying to solve my problem that I hope someone can help.I clench my teeth at night and have been wearing a night guard (lower) for 10+ years. I wear it 98% of the time but occasionally over the decade I forgot it once for a trip and have fallen asleep on the couch watching tv without it on. On these occasions I crack a tooth that becomes unrepairable. I have 3 molar implants on the bottom and a upper that I just lost in December 2017. I feel another upper is cracked too but not all the way through yet. The one I lost in Dec 2017 the Dentist said when extracting she found it to be really brittle and was breaking of in pieces on her.I've been trying to re-mineralize my teeth using MI paste but not sure if this is wishful thinking that it will help.I'm thinking about a upper mouth guard as well like a Farrari or NTi-tss guard.Any suggestions how to make my teeth stronger or to armour it even more?Thank you, I'm afraid I'm going to be in dentures eventually :-(\nBrian Busybee: Hi Brian, have you ever had chemotherapy? Crackedtoothguy: Hi BusybeeNo I haven't, but I know acid reflux was a issue years ago for me and I regret using teeth whitening trays years ago too as both I'm sure weakens the enamel... Busybee: Did you go to the dentist to have tooth whitening or were these trays you bought on the internet? Crackedtoothguy: I did the Zoom teeth whitening followed by trays and liquid both from the dentist. Busybee: Reflux can really mess your tooth structure up.  I have two friends who have been affected.  One has had implants the other has been told that his back teeth are on their last legs.   I'm surprised you haven't had gold onlays or something to strengthen the structure.  I'm a grinder and wear a guard but I managed to crack one tooth with a guard!  How unfair is that.  The crack wasn't too bad and now it's under an onlay.   I also have reflux but it's totally under control now and I don't think it ever reached my back teeth although I could feel acid in my throat when it was really bad.    I've had all sorts of adjustments to try to fix my bite and at the moment I am not clenching because of the work.   But I wouldn't recommend bite adjustments because I've had such a terrible time with it all.   I think all you can really do is to have a healthy diet, look after your gums (do you see a perio?) and floss and always have a guard with you.By the way some dentists recommend botox to relax the jaw muscles but I've read that can affect the bone mass in the jaw causing it to shrink.   I think mindfully relaxing your jaw all day so you get used to not clenching and also having some dental physio with acupressure massaging or even maybe some ultrasound helps.  I've had some of the massaging and it really helped when I was clenching a lot. Crackedtoothguy: I'm finding that my 3 Dentists I've had over the years haven't given me the support to resolve the issue but ways to fill in the holes to make them money. I just found out about inlays and overlays recently through my research and may use it for the remaining lower molar with a cavity in it to strengthen it. I never heard of dental physio with acupuncture until you mentioned it, thanks Busybee: Well dentists don't usually like to put onlays onto healthy teeth  There is always a risk of root failure or bite problems.   It's also possible there is a reason why they don't want to suggest this to you.  Perhaps the tooth structure isn't strong enough to support an onlay?    It's an invasive treatment and it would be unusual to put one in before there's a crack.   You need to discuss this with your dentist.  At least your last dentist realises you have brittle teeth so she may be more sympathetic to trying different options.  Complementary therapies such as acupuncture/acupressure can help your overall health as well as making the jaw more relaxed.  I'd say with a problem like this it's really important to keep as healthy as possible and make sure you do all you can to keep the connective tissues supplied with blood and nutrients.   I found yoga really helpful.  I know it's theoretically nothing to do with the jaw but it re-balances the whole body and works on the neck and jaw too.   Really gets the circulation boosted.   I had a friend who had a similar problem to you.  She was youngish (in her thirties) and had lost more than one tooth due to cracking.  She said it was genetic as her dad had the same problem."

I do trust my dentist completely (he's awesome!) and I don't really want to go elsewhere for a second opinion, so maybe someone can share some insight here.About 3 weeks ago I started having a sharp (not excruciating or anything) pain on the top left side of my mouth when drinking warm/hot liquids. The pain doesn't linger too long and it doesn't hurt with cold liquids. (I do have sensitive teeth and the cold does hurt at times, but this new pain is different – in a different spot and deeper). I've been to my dentist twice since then and he's checked everything thoroughly – xrays, etc. and nothing shows up. He says my teeth are fine and nothing can really be done until there are more symptoms. And I get that, I would not want to do anything that's unnecessary, but I worry for two reasons...aren't we always told prevention is the key and to not let things get worse? And, I'm going on holidays in two weeks and I don't even know what I would do if things got worse while I was travelling...My dentist did tell me he could phone in a prescription for antibiotics if my gums became swollen. Are there any other symptoms I should be looking for? My gums around the area where the pain is coming from have been kind of red since this started but he didn't seem to concerned about that. And I've been googling tooth/gum abscess and I have don't have a build up of pus that they talk about and my symptoms aren't that severe.It doesn't hurt to bite/chew or to brush or floss – only warm/hot liquids trigger the pain. And I'm sure this is not the pain of sensitive teeth – I've been dealing with that forever (I've been using Sensodyne for years) and know what that feels like. And, the dentist put some desensitizer on the area when I was in and it didn't help at all..I'm at a loss – any advice or help anyone could give would be greatly appreciated! Busybee: I've had this type of thing twice and in both cases it was a cracked tooth.  One was then fixed with a new filling another with a gold onlay.   Every dentist has a different approach but based on my experiences I personally wouldn't leave any tooth I have with heat sensitivity untreated. momoftwo: Busybee said:\t\t\tI've had this type of thing twice and in both cases it was a cracked tooth.

He took an x-ray (attached) and it seems I’m losing the tooth and there is an infection. The dentist told me that there is nothing he can do and the tooth needs to be extracted before the infection is spread to the adjacent teeth. Before I get my tooth pulled out I would like to ask for a second opinion. Do I really need to extract the tooth? Is it risky if I leave it untreated? Since I don’t have any pain nor discomfort it really annoys me thinking about losing a tooth. Any advice would be much appreciated!\nThank you very much in advance for your help!\nKind regards,\nCristina MattKW: Sorry, that's probably a goner. It's pain free because the abscess has managed to drain out through the gum. But one day you'll probably develop a facial swelling that won't be fun to extract, plus it's destroying the bone around the roots which diminishes your chances of later implant. The only way of possibly saving it is to see an endodontist for possible retreatment. Get a referral for a consultation. Cristina Montenegro: Thanks a lot for taking the time to reply to my message, really appreciated! In case a retreatment can be done, do you think it would be worth it? Or would you recommend an extraction? Because the tooth is in such a bad condition, I'm afraid I do a retreatment and maybe at some point the tooth needs to be extracted anyway, and loose a lot of money (retreatment plus a future implant).

My dentist says I have great oral hygiene and that I shouldn't  worry if they go away after brushing but I would like to know what I can do to prevent this. I have included a before and after picture from this morning. Some days the stains are worse than this and some better. Cadmaro: Here is a second, better, picture of the stains this morning. I uploaded the wrong one. MattKW: Looks like old discoloured composite fillings to me. Have you ever chipped those teeth?. Sometimes the dentist can simply repolish the fillings. Cadmaro: Yes the bottom edge of both of those teeth were chipped. They were repaired in December of 2017. The center of them has never been altered. Busybee: There must be something wrong with the material they used.  I have composite fillings but they do not stain like yours.  I had some years ago which did stain, but you couldn't brush it out.  But dentists have told me the more modern composites stain less and are stronger.  Do you drink coffee or red wine?   Because I drink both and my composites don't do this.  It's like yours are porous or something.  It's strange that when you clean them they are really white. Cadmaro: No red wine and very rarely drink coffee. Porosity was something I wondered about. Some days the stains come back in less than 12hrs but I can literally wipe them away with my T-shirt or a napkin and some elbow grease. Busybee: and it's just these two teeth that are affected? Cadmaro: Yes just these two teeth. Busybee: Is the dentist you are seeing the same dentist who fixed the chip with the composite? Cadmaro: No he is not. My insurance changed on Jan 1st and he was not on the list of approved people. Busybee: You should go back to the guy who fixed the chip and demand an explanation."

My dentist took 2 X-rays and told me that they would have to remove the crown and repair the decay and take impressions for another crown.    When she started to fill the cavity she realized that the decay was to deep and to close to the nerve and the tooth would require a root canal. I then got in later the same day to the Endodontis. He took the same 2 X-rays my Dentist took and the an additional\n2 more , 1 during the procedure and 1 after. Does taking 6 x-rays on one tooth pose any risk as far as radiation goes? MattKW: Nope. In dental school, most new patients would have a full mouth series of about 16 Xrays as a general screening process. And we are always exposed to background radiation - a dental Xray is equivalent to about 8 hours of background radiation."

More dentists should use them as they have a very good success rate compared to a filling, but takes a bit of getting used to the technique. For girls I call them \"glitter\" or \"princess\" teeth; for boys they're \"robot\" teeth.  The number on the outside is to help the dentist know which tooth it usually fits.

While in some cases this may be true however, in other situations that isn't the case.About 90% of the time the swollen lip occurs from biting while numb. Patients (kids especially) may not be aware that they're doing this. 1. In general, allergic reactions do not produce a localized ulcerated area away from the injection of the alleged allergen. The appearance of this is simply not consistent with an allergic reaction.\n2. The injection site is nearly always located far away from the traumatized area – in some cases nearly two inches. If it were an allergy, why then is the injection site totally normal?\n3. Lack of systemic sympotoms; even less severe allergic reactions will produce other symptoms such as dry mouth, hives, and other findings. None of these are typically present in lip biting.

    "dialogue": "brancron: Colgate has this new mouthwash containing mineral oil and sunflower seed oil. The green liquid that floats to the top of the bottle is the oil. The active ingredient in the mouthwash is water-soluble cetylpyridinium chloride, which is present in an equal amount in Colgate's regular (oil free) mouthwash. I tried this stuff and it is gross. Even when you shake it up well, a mouthfull of the stuff coats the lining of your mouth with a thin film of oil. I contacted Colgate's customer service to ask what the purpose of the oil is. Here is their response:>The oil is comprised of mineral oil, flavor, sunflower oil and beta carotene. A hydrophobic material, such as mineral oil, is needed to form visible bits upon expectorating. As oil is not easily dispersed by common mouthwash surfactants to form a stable single phase product, the product was instead formulated to be delivered as a two phase, oil over water product.My question to /r/dentistry is this: is there any possible dental or hygienic reason you can think of for why they've added oil to this mouthwash? Doing so just for appearance seems incredibly bizarre, especially considering how gross it is. From what I can tell, a lot of people agree that it is an unpleasant product to use. One possible lead: the online ingredient list for the product indicates that both the mineral and sunflower seed oils are there to \"solubilize other ingredients in the finished product.\" Is it possible that the active ingredient is also soluble in oil, so that there's a benefit to the oil's propensity to linger and keep the ingredient from washing away? Page three of this data sheet states that cetylpyridinium chloride is \"more soluble in oil\" (more than in water?) but I good be reading that wrong and don't see such information listed anywhere else. Any thoughts or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! brancron: I finally got a followup response from Colgate. This is what they've said:\"The formula contains a water phase containing CPC and oil phase with the flavor (aroma) and other oils. Immediately after completely mixing the 2 phases, rinsing with the resulting emulsion gives the formation of particles (“bits”) that are seen in the sink upon expectoration. The resulting emulsion also gives a different mouth feel. The emulsion is necessary for lifting debris and bacteria form the mouth.\""

    "dialogue": "Sky_Nova_20: I had a dentist appointment. I went there for a check-up and made x-rays and teeth cleaning. However, the dentist mentioned that I had 9 cavities and I had to do root canal treatment for all of them and my family and I were shocked with the news. Most of my teeth don't even look like they have cavities and I'm really disappointed. I heard that root canal treatment is a very difficult and painful process for a lot of people, but others claim that it isn't as bad they thought, but I think it would be a hard process. So, I don't know how to deal with this anymore. I couldn't even pay attention to everything on the x-rays, since I was very upset. I wish I had the x-rays with me right now, but I actually don't have them. Busybee: you can ask the practice for your x rays and get a second opinion from a different dentist.   Do any of your teeth hurt? Sky_Nova_20: Busybee said:\t\t\tyou can ask the practice for your x rays and get a second opinion from a different dentist.

My mom and sister just told me that I had to root canal treatment for one tooth only, but I'm not sure about the other teeth. Busybee: Well twice I was told I needed root treatment when I didn't.  The last time was ten years ago.  Nothing happened and other dentists said it's all fine.  So forgive me if I don't trust such a diagnosis but I always say seek another opinion.  It's a big step and it's permanent. John Roberts: Good advice Busybee.  Second opinion in order. Uptown101: I agree, you should consult another dentist for a second opinion because it's not that easy to undergo a root canal treatment."

    "title": "What could be causing the rapid sensitization of my teeth?",
    "dialogue": "FalloutFan: Over the last 1 or 2 years my teeth have been getting increasingly more sensitive to breathing in and cold things. Whenever I breathe in, the front of most of my teeth experiences noticeable pain, and occasionally the pain is jarring and comes from inside the tooth (but this only happens for a few teeth).some general info: my top teeth crowd inwards and I need braces, I brush twice a day and floss about once a week. Busybee: Do you use sensitive toothpaste?  I had problems with sensitivity when I had a bite problem.   If you have too much pressure on teeth it can make them sensitive.  Try to relax your jaw in the day and get a nightguard to wear at night. FalloutFan: Yeah I've been using Sensodyne for the past 3 or 4 years. I do have alignment problems as my top 8 or so teeth point inwards. But can that really cause the fronts of my teeth to be sensitive? Busybee: Well I found it surprising that a bite adjustment made my teeth more sensitive.  The dentist said that if teeth are knocked about it tends to create sensitivity. Lyle MacLeod: You could try brushing once more per day and flossing more often. Whenever I feel some sensitivity, it usually goes away when I brush. However I feel your situation is a little more severe. John Roberts: Hey Busbee.  We have talked before and you had some advice.  I was wondering about you said you bite was off.  How did it get off?  And were all your teeth hurting and not just one or two.  I am still fighting all my teeth hurting.  I am getting to where it is hard for me to eat anything real solid.  It hurts all my teeth when I eat and I know I am not chewing stuff up like I should.  I just cannot get an answer.  I asked the last dentist I went to a few weeks ago if the could tell me 95% sure there is nothing wrong with my teeth.  He just says he can't see anything.  I do feel my bite is exactly right but I haven't had any thing to change it.  If you will remember all my trouble started after a cleaning and fluoride treatment.  I just can't believe my bite could be off so much that all my teeth hurt but I don't know.  I am wondering if it could be neuralgia.  I don't think I have trigeminal neuralgia or I would even be worse than I am.  Maybe so other type but I am just having a hard time excepting that.  I have been to 10 or so dentist.  You would think one of them could figure it out if it is dental.  I am at a point I don't know what to do.  I do know it is really effecting my health in general.  I have a new general practitioner and he put me on a antidepressant and I am having bad side effects from it to go along with the teeth.  He diagnosed me with burning mouth syndrome.  I may have had it three years ago but not now.  Just wondering if all you teeth hurt. Busybee: Hi John.  I've had a lot of problems with my bite since a botched bite adjustment.   Then others trying to fix it just made things worse and many of the teeth would hurt.   I wouldn't say all my teeth hurt, it was mainly the molars.  The teeth were more sensitive because there was too much pressure on some of them.   They tended to hurt more when chewing.  But if you have had a bad reaction to something like cleaning solution then over time the pain should reduce.  It could take a few months to a couple of years.  The body reacts in different ways in different people.   Perhaps they should give you a guard to wear when you eat to see whether it makes a difference (I mean in terms of avoiding any food touching the teeth in case that's making things worse).   Did you say you wear a night guard when you sleep? John Roberts: I have had two  mouth guards made.  One for the top which I could never wear because in my opinion it was made badly.  I did one of the boil and bite ones which I can wear and one of the dentist made one for my lower teeth.  My teeth hurt to bad to wear the ones the dentist made.  I use the one I made ( which the dentist was impressd) at time when my teeth are really bothering me bad.  I wore my guard every night for a month to see if I could tell any difference and I couldn't.  I have told all 9 dentist I have been to that my bite doesn't feel right and it seems like it changes.  I have been checked by mire than one with the articulating paper.  It looks like if my bite was off that bad they could tell and say something.  I still wonder about the fluroide treatment also.  Was the fluroide bad, did they use the wrong kind for someone that had crowns, did the girl leave it in my mouth too long.  I don't know but all my trouble started after that.  Keep in touch.  Oh, did you finally get your bite right? Busybee: Well what happens is they give you a mouth guard to see whether your bite feels good with the guard.  If it doesn't then either the guard is badly made (happens a lot) or it's nothing to do with the bite.   If you feel comfortable with the guard then it's totally bite-related.  If it was your bite every single tooth wouldn't be hurting.  You'd have a few that were symptom free.  But it might feel as though they were all hurting.   So from what you've said it may not be your bite, but you have to find another bite guard that's well made and adjusted to your mouth to know for sure.   Could you just remind me how long ago this happened?  I haven't got my bite quite right.   Once they mess with the bite it's impossible to get it right.   I'm still waiting for a crown to be made (a crown that I didn't need but was suggested to stabilise the bite).    My problem is that work I've had done tends to wear down and then I feel uncomfortable again.   Only takes a tiny bit of wear to shift it.  But when I wake up I feel ok and sleep ok because of the mouth guard.    However, I am in far less pain than two years ago when things were really bad after a botch job.   I have just the odd twinge in a couple of teeth.   The wrong guard can make your teeth hurt all day.   The wrong dentist can ruin your teeth for life.  Unfortunately they don't come with a label! John Roberts: Well when I put the mouth guard in I guess it does feel better because my teeth aren't touching so I guess I don't know how to answer that one.  When i think about every single tooth hurting my very back jaw teeth are not as bad as the rest but they don't touch like the rest. I am sure the bite of these teeth is not right. I had a crown come off of #2 back several months ago and if feels better with it off.  I have 600.00 in two dentist mouth guards and for sure can't wear one of them and the other is extremely tight.  It is for my bottom teeth.  I have worked on the boil and bit myself to where it slips on and off my teeth with little effort and it is not extremely tight.  I can sleep with it at night and it does not come off.  \nI forgot all this has been going on since November 2016.\nI actually put a small ball of dental wax in tooth # 14 and tooth # 4 to keep them slightly apart when I put my teeth together.  Helps me go to sleep.  I did wear my mouth guard for a month straight at night to see if I could tell a difference and I don't think I could.  Maybe I need to start wearing it again at night and as much as I can in the day and just see if I can tell any difference.\nI went to a dentist in a different town that has  T Scan or Tech Scan technology. She talked to me and I told her my bite, and speech weren't' right and I pronounced some words different.  I don't know if you are familiar with this technology or you know anyone who has ever had it done.  I guess if your bite is off a little it would work but I am afraid it won't work and then all my teeth will be adjusted on and like you said you can't put it back and I don't have thousands of dollars to have crowns put on everything.\nI have learned that just a hair makes a difference.  I told the last dentist it almost feel like my bottom jaw is forward or something. Feels like my bottom front teeth put pressure on my top fronts.  It doesn't seem like I can put my teeth together good and make a good swallow. also. I even thought maybe during the cleaning I help my mouth open too wide and to long and caused some problems with my bite.  I have had face ct scan, scan on my tmj joints, brain scan and sleep study done.  The sleep study said I have mild sleep apena but I don't grind my teeth which I didn't think I did.  \nAs far as the neuralgia thing goes.  I have been having some eye pain again but not bad.  I have developed tinnitus along the way also.  I'll keep you posted.  Thanks Busybee Busybee: You should go back to the dentist who made the mouth guard and tell them it does not fit and ask them to remake it.  You need a properly made guard if you are to get anywhere in working out how much of this is bite related.   They should make you a guard that's comfortable. It sounds like your bite is off but that makes no sense because you didn't have it adjusted.  It would seem that you have some TMJ but then you didn't say the x rays indicated any problems with the jaw joint (I have a clicky jaw on one side and that shows up on CT scans).    I have tinnitus in one ear (next to the clicky joint) and it comes and goes.  I only have it at night but I see it as an indicator of a problem with the bite.    It's possible that when they were working on your teeth the joint or muscle supporting it could have been damaged from having it open so long.  But I'm surprised that hasn't shown on CT.   The only thing I can think of is that maybe you had a large build up of calculus on your teeth and the clean removed that.   Does that sound possible? John Roberts: Up until all this started I went to the dentist for a cleaning every six months.  Been doing it for years.  The hygienist didn't say anything about my teeth.  It didn't seem like it took her long to do the cleaning.  So I don't know.  Like I said that was my first fluoride ever.\nI think the second guard was probably made right.  The first on was a hard guard and it didn't fit.  It was like it was for someone else.  The second one I had made a month ago was for the bottom teeth and it was a softer material.  It fits my teeth but they are so sensitive  ( if that is the word for it) than when I put it on it just squeezes my teeth and I can't stand it.  I would say it does fit though.  I am going to start wearing my little guard more.  I can stand it because it is loose enough.  Don't know if that's good or not but I don't see where it could alter or move my teeth.\nThe CT Scan of my face and TMJ joints were done at the VA Hospital.  I assume they have someone reading them that knows what they are doing.  At least I hope some.  I don't have any pain or clicking or anything like that in the joints.  My ENT and Gp and a couple of the dentist said I don't have TMJ but I don't know about that either.  I figure if my jaw moved a hair it would throw my bite off.\nAfter all this started and I went to a different dentist and I already had teeth contacting hard and he did adjust on them.  Something had caused this but I don't know what.  I realize after the fact I shouldn't have had any grinding done.  It looks like the dentist would have thought about it a little.  I told him I never had this problem before.  \nCould I ask you about your opinion of the T scan or Tech scan for oclussion adjustment.  I have watched several videos on youtube about it.  It seems like a wonderful thing and maybe could be of benefit.  I went to the dentist on Lafayette La. that has it.  No one here where I live does.  I was suppose to go back and she was going to do the adjustment.  I don't know how many times you have to go back.  Then she wanted to make a new mouth guard.  I got scared of it and didn't go back but now I am wondering.  The adjustment was 750.00 and the mouth guard was 750.00.  I didn't ask her what kind it was.  I don't have insurance but right now if it  would help I would be glad to pay that.\nI just read what I wrote and let me say that my bite was off before any kind of adjustment was done.  Let me know what you think of the T Scan thing.  Thanks    John Busybee: Hi John, I watched a T scan video on you tube.  My opinion of this is that it's totally reliant on the data that has been fed into it by humans.  So it will be based on the same pre-set notions of what constitutes a perfect bite (the text book bite).  In my opinion, and I'm not a dental professional but I do have a fair bit of experience of what can go wrong, the text book bite is a myth.  Every individual is going to be comfortable with a different bite because we are all different.  Some people are very happy with what a textbook defines as  dysfunctional bite.  They are not only happy but have no dental issues, decay or pain.   The brain is programmed to expect teeth to be in certain positions and once you start to adjust them the memory of that programming leads to long-term dissatisfaction whenever the jaws come into contact.  So the muscles contract more to try to find it and this leads to different bite problems and added stress.   So in my humble opinion dentists should not be adjusting down the bite unless there are exceptional circumstances.  You cannot replace what nature has created.  Once you start having crowns and other restorations you can start to build in a bite problem for the future, particularly when you have a large amount of work in one session.   If you then start to grind down the bite there's more pressure in areas that may be weaker than necessary to sustain it.  A dentist cannot feel the areas of weakness but your mouth can.   Trying to then go back and build up again can lead to cracked teeth as restorations are never the same as the original cusps.   Changing one thing in a bite affects numerous other areas.  There are too many variables involved to make this a regular option for a dental professional.  It can affect the TMJ and muscles, but also the neck, shoulders and back.   How can a dentist predict what it affects?   It takes an exceptional individual to understand the bite and make successful changes.  From what you've said your problem is sensitivity following the fluoride treatment.  This may have led to you changing your muscle action to avoid the sensitive teeth so it may now feel like you have a bite problem, but what you might be doing is changing all the behaviour of the jaw to avoid pain.  So you have maybe formed new habits that have affected your alignment.   Then you had a bite adjustment and we don't know how much that has contributed to your subsequent problems.You can have a bite guard that is soft inside and hard outside.  The hard outside bit is a good idea for diagnosis.   Bear in mind that it's extremely difficult to adjust a hard guard so that someone with sensitive teeth is comfortable.  Some dentists are gifted in intuitively adjusting, others are not.  Listening to the patient is important for successful adjustments. John Roberts: Well I am at a point that I don't know what to do.  Like I said one of the doctors said it was all a continuation of some type of Nerulgia I had two or so years ago.  I doubt it be could be.  I am still leaning on my bite or teeth alignment isn't right.  I am afriad to have more adjustments made for fear of making it worse than it is.  As much as I have read on this mess you would think I would know.  Is there a dentist that specializes in oclussion.  I didn't know who to go to when this started and I did go to a orthodontist.  I had one jaw tooth that was hurting the worst.  He did say something about roller coaster teeth and sent me to a endodontist to have the tooth looked at.  \nI don't know about the fluroide thing.  You could have a good point.  All my trouble did start after that.   I don't know if any dentist around here could diagnose that.  I have told everyone of them about the fluroide treatment.  \nI had thought about having the t scan done but you have a lot of good points on it.  I have no doubt in some situations it could help IF the dentist knows what they are doing.  That's another thing with the t scan.  Wonder how they learn to use it.  Oh well, That's enough for now.  Thanks for reading this and the suggestions. Emedee: Hi FalloutFan,The cause of the issue you are having may be most probably caused by receding gums. It may also be casued by other things such as worn tooth enamel. Try to avoid drinking soft drinks and grinding your teeth, do use fluoride toothpaste.i recommend you visit below website and read the articles carefully:\nhttps://crest.com/en-us/oral-health...ity/teeth-sensitive-cold-causes-home-remediescheers,\nEmedee John Roberts: Thanks Emedee.  I know my gums have receded some with age.  All this started basically overnight.  I would think if it was gum recession it would have taken a while.  I did go to a periodontist when this first started and he said my gums looked fine so I kind of ruled that out.  Two of the dentist recommended a sleep study.  I had one and I have mild sleep apnea and during the study I didn't grind my teeth. I am pretty sure I don't anyway.  I have a soft mouth guard I have had for several months.  I sleep with it at night sometime.  I think if I grind my teeth I would have chewed it up by now and it looks like it did when I started using it.   I don't really  have the symptoms of a teeth grinder.  I am kind of just the opposite. My teeth don't hurt any worse in the morning,  I don't have jaw pain or headaches.  Sometime my eyes will hurt in the morning.   I have had two night guards made by dentist and they both are terrible.  I use a over the counter guard some just to keep my teeth apart when they are really bothering me like today.  I do feel like my bite is not right but not sure what to do but I don't know if that is why my teeth are killing me.  Like I had said in a earlier post that they are not sensitive to hot or cold.  They are sensitive to the touch or tap or scratch them with your finger nail.  That kind of hurt.  Thanks for the suggestions.  I am listening you can be sure. Emedee: My tooth also hurted on tap. It turned out that it was a gum around a tooth that caused the pain as a matter of fact. Try cleaning the areas that hurt with a dental floss, I think that should help. For me it helped in 2 days. Then after some time I was too lazy to clean them and the pain in the tooth appeared again. I didn't recognize that it was a pain from gums and I went to a dentist and got scammed for 1435 sek = around 143 eur for two holes that he created himself and told me I had a loss of a filling. So try it out and see the effects. You can feel the dental flosss after use if it has an unpleasant scent if it does then you probably got it. Cheers Uptown101: Brushing too hard or using a hard-bristled toothbrush. This can wear down enamel, causing dentin to become exposed, or encourage gum recession."

    "dialogue": "John Roberts: Just wondering about opinions on boil and bite guards vs guards the dentist makes.  I have both kinds.  First one was a boil and bite.  Then the dentist made one.  It was hard and killed my already hurting teeth.  Couldn't adjust it to fit.  Went back to the boil and bite.  Another dentist said I could try a soft one on my lower teeth.  It is a little better but still fits too tight for my liking.  Back to my boil and bite I trimmed to fit.  It stays on my teeth but I can slip it off with my tongue.  I really can't see where it would hurt my teeth anymore than the dental guard.  I really can't see the difference of me biting into the tray with goop in it at the dentist or biting into the boil and bite at home.  Seems like both ways should conform to your teeth.  \nI wear it sometime because I have pain in most all my teeth.  Use it to keep them apart."

They had to scrap that one and gave me a new one with a substantially bigger bulge at the place where I rest my teeth and a different form of acrylic to compensate for the strong bite( the one in the pic), but few weeks later same thing happened lol. (Where you see the slight indents was where the rounded extra bulge was) Maybe it is a common occurrence and it's just my dentists that haven't seen it before, I find it pretty cool though and why could it be that my jaw is so strong?

I've never had anyone problems with it for the last 4 years. But now I have a throbbing toothache that will come and go on this tooth. I can't even push my tongue against the tooth without feeling the discomfort, it's very sensitive. I can't even chew on that side. \nI'm just wondering why now after all these years it's giving me problems? Will I most likely need a root canal?

I did not hit my head in the crash.On 1/18/18 my upper right tooth, #4, started hurting.  It has root canal symptoms including sensitivity to hot and cold which lasts longer than a minute, constant toothache, throbbing toothache, pain with biting and chewing.Now it's been a couple of days and two other teeth have started hurting.  So far it's just toothache and light sensitivity with liquids.  One is an upper left tooth and the other is a lower left tooth.I'm wondering if any of these teeth problems can be related to the car accident? Is it possible for symptoms to start a month or longer after something like that?I'm wondering if I clenched my teeth or somehow bit together and the teeth hit each other on impact.  I was stunned and shaken up for a couple of hours afterwards and had adrenaline running through me.  Even the neck and back pain I didn't feel right on impact.I'm scheduled to have a root canal treatment on #4 with an endodontist on 2/8/18.

    "dialogue": "Lizzooo: i had crown done a couple years ago that I had to have adjusted/filed down multiple times which resulted in no discomfort afterwards.  I have been doing Invisalign for about 13 weeks now and changing trays each week without problems.  Recently I went to pull out my tray and had pain and discomfort in my crown when taking the tray off.  It is not sensitive to cold or hot but just when pressure is put on it.  Kindof like a bruise it isn’t painful until touched and then the “pain” is more of an ache.  I am wondering if I should contact my orthodontist or my regular dentist regarding this? Busybee: yes you should because your tray may need adjusting.  You could end up cracking the tooth if it's too high inside.  I cracked a molar with a hard night guard and this sounds like a similar pain.  Easy for them to adjust it slightly.  I'd check with the ortho.  They have caused the pain."

    "dialogue": "Kait: Here it is in list form:\n1) it’s the molar directly above #19 (that’s 22 or 24??)\n2) had a root canal ~20yrs ago, filling (apparently) should have been replaced ages ago, miraculously it was perfectly fine at my last cleaning in Nov...but the new dentist said though not required it might be a good idea get a crown. I decided to do some adulting (first mistake, lol) and pay the $ to get a proper crown.\n3) major cold temp sensitivity during 3wks of temp crown.\n4) zirconia crown placement immediately felt not right. I “complained” within 1-2wks, they looked, assured it was fine.\n5) the problem was it felt as if it had too much curvature, and the base of my tooth slightly showed, which concerned me.\n5a) by curvature I mean literally half the food I ate would get stuck in between the back-most molar and crown. I’ve used an entire roll of floss and bottle of mouthwash in the last 1mo alone to battle this (my teeth are kinda important to me)\n6) I am pretty much fed up, and completely bummed that I’ve forever ruined my mouth, I’ve never seen so much food coming out of one tooth crease. And no matter how much I brush it and use mouthwash multiple times a day, I feel an awful taste (could be the epoxy? Prob bacteria, sadly). It feels unacceptable.\n7) tonight, low and behold, my crown fell off while chewing...cooked rice.\n8) there is zero pain or sensitivity (except maybe a faint dull feeling far below the surface....maybe it’s in my head - no pun intended). \n9) terrified to go back to the same dentist...I think they did a not so great job, and I don’t want to loose my tooth...but going somewhere new is not only expensive but also unknown.\n10) tangent info, part of why I went ahead and had the procedure for the top molar is because part of the filling of my #19 fell out (cracked when I was young) so somehow thought to just fix/update both with zirconia and call it a day. Unfortunately, temps were very ill fitting, in my opinion; lots of pain @19, “required” root canal by separate dentist 1mo later (was delay in crown placement for various reasons). Crown on 19 is too big (my opinion) gum at cheek interface bulges slightly more than opposite side of mouth, not painful there but, tooth is overall still tender 2mo later, esp when flossing (no blood), and has some feeling when pressing down on it.\n11) after 45m-1hr of trying to fix bite we settled at “almost there” during final visit (beg of Dec).\n12) to top it all off my the back molar now has two small brown spots where the crown ‘touched’. It was perfect before.\n13) my insurance changed in Jan 1st. Not sure how I feel about thatQuestions: Is it common for a perm crown to come off within 2mo? How do you recommend that I approach the dentist? I don’t want to hurt their feelings but I basically spent $1400 to botch my teeth (so it feels). I think they knew it to some extent because of the look on their face when all finished and with a concerned face said “you need to take very good care of these”. I don’t think they did it on purpose, but I’m not convinced they can fix it properly.What is the etiquette here?Thanks,\nKait Busybee: There is something seriously wrong with a crown that falls off.   Find a better dentist, get some legal advice."

    "title": "Jaw Pain After Fillings",
    "dialogue": "teeth9876: Three weeks ago, I went into my dentist for a routine scheduled cleaning, where they found I needed 3 cavity fillings. So, the next day, I went back and had them filled all in one day (it only took about 2 hours). All of the fillings were done on my back molars, both sides, and one was really deep and getting close to the nerve.I went home, and as the numbing wore off I took an ibuprofen to relieve the pain. Ever since then, I have had pain radiating in my jaw. It is the worst at night, usually waking me up in the middle of the night, making me take more ibuprofen. The pain killers work. I have to take one around 2:30PM in the afternoon, and one in the middle of the night around 2:00AM. The pain is in my jaw, not my teeth. It almost feels like the jaw muscle itself. Sometimes it even comes with an ear ache. I have no sensitivity to hot or cold, and it does not hurt when I chew, bite, or open and close my mouth wide. It is a very dull ache that becomes more active at night. When I wake up in the morning, it doesn't hurt at all.After two weeks, I called my dentist explaining the pain I have been feeling, and went in for a check in my bite. They did take some off my bite; however, it did not relieve the pain. They thought I might need a root canal in the tooth with the deep filling, and said to wait a week and give us a call if it gets worse. That night, it was bad! The pain in my jaw was excruciating! So in the morning I called them, and scheduled a root canal for the next day.The next night before the root canal, I didn't have any pain. I didn't even have to take pain killers, but I went in for the root canal anyway just to talk to them. After explaining everything again, we did some tests and x-rays. The x-rays came back positive, nothing was wrong. The cold and hot test was normal, meaning no sensitivity. My bite was fine, they had already corrected it. They canceled the root canal, since there were no obvious signs of needing one.Their diagnosis was that I have jaw pain from having my mouth open from the fillings. They said call back in a week if the pain is still hurting, and we will prescribe an night guard. I still have pain, especially at night. What is the cause of it? I have heard of TMD, but that hurts when you bite. Please help me. Thank you!"

    "dialogue": "bdpoop: I am booked in to have root canal work and a new crown on one of my upper front teeth.  The crown and the tooth it was on broke off a couple of years ago and there was just enough tooth left exposed for my Dentist (Who is very good by the way) to put in three tiny posts to refit the crown.\nHowever, since this was done about a year ago the upper part of my gum has felt tender to the touch.  Like a bruise when you press it.  Not painful at all but you can feel a slight pain when you press it.  My dentist x-rayed it and thinks there is slight dark area that’s probably an infection and he has suggested removing the crown and doing some root canal work to cure the infection then putting a single post in and fitting a new crown. (least I Think this is what he said).\nI am concerned though that it could be last chance saloon with this tooth and that something might go wrong and he may not be able to fit the post and crown.  Is there any other way this could be treated as the crown is fine and I do not want to lose my front tooth or be forced down the implant route?  Could I just leave it?  He has basically said it’s up to me but I am not really sure what the risks are.  Could it just go away or at best just remain as it is?  Will the infection if it is an infection get worse?  It’s been like that for a year and whilst it’s not got better it’s not got worse either.  If it was to get worse could I not have the procedure done then or would it then be too late?\nAny advice really appreciated. Busybee: I'm surprised that the dentist did not do a root canal when fitting posts.  But then I'm not a dentist.   If you have a soreness where the root is then that is an indication of an infection.  Get a second opinion but generally a tooth will feel weird if infected, the area around the gum will feel sore but you won't be able to tell quite where the pain is coming from.   There is often a blister on the gum by the root, but that's not always the case.  Sometimes the tooth just feels alien as it dies.   It doesn't go away once there is a root infection.   But you should see an endodontist to have a root canal done. bdpoop: Thanks. Its not even sore really.  Just as you say feels a bit odd like pressing a bruise if you press hard on the top of the gum.  As said my concern is if something goes wrong and the dentist is unable to fit a new post and crown.  I would rather leave it as it is but need to know what the risks are. bdpoop: That appears to be a map of Belgrade.  Thanks but Im not sure how that is helpful Dusan Cirkovic: I made mistake..sorry... cheers"

    "title": "3 month ordeal replacing 4 crowns on my front teeth has lead to an abscess",
    "dialogue": "Pam Thomas: I apologize, this is a lengthy thread but I'm hoping for some insight.I started my journey 3 months ago to replace my 4 porcelain crowns on my front teeth that were over 10 years old.  The crowns had become cracked over time and I had an accident over the summer colliding with my dog where I felt certain I probably broke my nose, although I didn't go to the hospital.  The crowns began to bother me a bit after this accident so I bit the bullet and started the process to replace them. I spent over 3 hours in the dental chair the first visit and the temporary they made for me seemed very tight and uncomfortable.  I left the dentist thinking once the swelling went down a bit the temporary would be fine.  This wasn't the case.  I ended up back at the dentist the next morning in excruciating pain.  I had to get Novocain shots again and the technician made some adjustments to the temporary.  The fit seemed better but still uncomfortable.  I couldn't tread dental floss through it without pain so my gums remained puffy.  I figured I could make it two weeks until my permanent crowns were made.  As it turned, out the lab lost my case and it took a month to get my permanent crowns back. Finally, I was able to go to the appointment to have my permanent crowns seated.  The lab had not done a good job of making them and the dentist wanted them perfect, so we did another impression and sent them back.  They went ahead and temporarily cemented the bad permanent set in.  They seemed much more comfortable than the temporary.  I actually got out of pain and was feeling good when I went in for my second shot at the permanent seat.  The technician had a really hard time getting these crowns out.  It was very uncomfortable.  Again, the dentist was not happen with the way they looked but, I thought they looked better than the second set so we temporarily cemented these in, then more impressions and more waiting. One of the two front teeth was much longer then the other and I had some pain when I bit down but I thought it was due to my bite being off slightly.  I had a lot of travel for work and pleasure so I just sucked it up.Last week, I flew to Dallas and on the way home I began to have a strange feeling that my upper lip was swelling and something just felt wrong.  By the time I woke up Saturday morning, I had an abscess.  My upper lip and left side of my face were very swollen.  I've been on antibiotics for three days and I still have some swelling.  I'm seeing my dentist today.Finally, my question, the dentist said my real teeth were not cracked, only the crowns.  We've done a lot of X-rays and no one said the roots looked compromised.  Is there anyway the dentist could have known three months ago that this might happen and had me see an Endodontist first to avoid the abscess? I really like my dentist but this makes me question their treatment.  I've spent a lot of money and now I'm not sure what this abscess means for my dental health.  Will it require surgery to drain or just a root canal, could I loose this tooth and have to get an implant. Robert Tucker: As I understand it, abscesses are not all the result of decaying pulp in the pulp chamber and roots. They can be more superficial and are well known to dentists as a possibility when crowns are fitted. You should find out the nature of the abscess to determine what treatment you may need. Pam Thomas: Thanks for your reply.  As it turns out, I will have to have 2 root canals on my two front teeth.  Obviously, this is not what I had hoped, but I'm happy that I won't have to worry about the health of these two teeth for a good long while after I get this taken care.  I think, before I agree to anymore crowns, I'll request a consultation with an Endodontist just to make sure the teeth I'm crowning are not dead.  The good news, these crowns I'm wearing now are temporarily cemented in and I have a brand new set waiting for me once the root canals heal. Busybee: I would go to an endodontist to have the root treatment done as you want any treatment on your front teeth to be perfect.   If you change crowns there is always a risk of root failure because of the trauma and because it exposes the underlying tooth to bacteria.  But I think it's your accident that caused these roots to die.   You don't see root failure on x ray until a few weeks after it starts. John Roberts: I too any having teeth problems with the front four top being the worst.  Three of the top four have  crowns and two of them root canals and they hurt worse than any of the others.  I guess my comment us why us a technician doing any adjustments on a crown.  Sometimes I think technicians do stuff they aren't suppose to.  All comes down to money.  Hope you get your problem fixed soon."

    "dialogue": "Victoria27: I recently had terrible pain in a lower back tooth. When I went to see my new NHS dentist (I've just moved) she said there was infection and decay and I needed a root canal filling. She did the initial part of removing the nerve and cleaning the tooth out and packing it. She then made me an appointment to come back in a month's time to complete the root canal. I've had a couple of root canals in the past and after this first step was completed the pain was always gone. However this time the pain only grew worse and I went back a couple of days later in agony. She redid the tooth, cleaning it out again and sent me off with antibiotics. Well this was repeated several times over the next 3 weeks, her cleaning out the tooth only for the pain to keep returning a couple of days later. After having the tooth redone about 4 times (I lost count) I finally asked her to remove it which she did as I was so sick of the pain. When the tooth came out it was full of infection at the bottom which was what was obviously causing me the pain. Now I was wondering if this was normal for a dentist to miss so much infection in a tooth when they'd been deep into it several times and taken two x rays? Or is common that infection can be hard to find in a root? I need to go back for further treatment at the end of the month and am nervous in case this happens again. The surgery has overall good reviews online and it's very hard to find a good NHS dentist in my area so am reluctant to change but if this isn't normal then will make the effort. Thanks for any advice you can give! Busybee: Firstly I am very sorry you lost your tooth.  No it's not normal and you should always go to an endodontist for root canal therapy.  Once the dentist could see that the root canal wasn't working out, she should have referred you to a specialist.    Please find another dentist.   I always go private because I have not had good experiences with NHS dentistry.   It can cost you more than you save, particularly as you have lost something priceless. Victoria27: Thanks for taking the time to comment Busybee. Unfortunately my financial situation is pretty dire and there's no way I can afford private dentistry. I called 3 private dentists and got quotes of £800 from all of them. I would never be able to pay this back, especially as I will be needing further treatment soon. I guess this is why poor people have bad teeth! I have had two root canals before with a regular NHS dentist which were both absolutely fine which is why I was so surprised that there were so many issues this time and was wondering if it was a problem with the dentist herself.

By the end of the month the pain had faded but was still there slightly.My dentist redid the white filling and now I’m back to square one with the sharp pain on biting.There is no sensitivity to hot or cold, the dentist didn’t see any cracks etc and told me to persevere as it is a small filling.Anyone have a similar experience?

I have had a look at other forums and advice online and most people say it might be a crack and to have it out but how am i sure 100% its a crack and that i should have it out? The pain is really hard to localise between the recently filled one and the one next to it (also has an amalgam filling which was placed around 3 years ago), i have even tried watching myself eating in the mirror when the pain comes but its really hard to tell which tooth out of the two the pain is coming from...\nAnyone got any advice or ideas what it could be? The pain is ONLY there when i chew \nThanks Busybee: If there is a crack that is serious then you would have a pain like an electric shock when you bite down on it when eating hot food.    It's a very distinctive pain that feels like it fills the whole tooth with the heat of the food.   If you can feel the cold in the tooth then the root is alive.  Minor cracks are present in many of our teeth without us realising and tend to settle into a balance.  It can take a filling a while to settle and you might find that in two or three months it no longer hurts.   Avoid hard foods on that side in the meantime."

    "dialogue": "Kaitlyn: Hi there,I've been dealing with agonizing pain for a few weeks now. It comes on gradually and just radiates through the entire left side of my mouth/jaw. I had a dental appointment where I had some cavities filled on the left side. The dentist needed me to open my mouth suuuuper wide, and I have a very small mouth. While she had my mouth open, my jaw started to cramp up a little bit. I also noticed that the fillings made my teeth sit differently. I've woken up a few times during the night with my jaw clenched. The pain also seems to move into my ear at times. My teeth themselves don't hurt (I think??), but my gums seem to hurt on the left side (top and bottom.)She did let me know that one of the teeth she filled could need a root canal, but I haven't noticed a lot of pain (besides a little sensitivity here and there) coming from it. Another tooth has a temporary filling while I wait for a crown, and it's a little sensitive as well, but I don't think there's any pain coming from it.It's just so hard to tell where the pain is actually coming from once it really gets going. The place where my TMJ connects is tender and feels different than the other side. I can tell that the left side of my face swells just a little bit when the pain starts. I haven't had any fever and my lymph nodes don't feel swollen. That's why I'm thinking the pain has to do with my jaw. But can my jaw really cause this much pain?? It's terrible if I try to bear it. I've been taking ibuprofen every 6-8 hours to keep the pain at bay. Ice packs seem to help, too.I have a dentist appointment this week, but I just wanted to see if anyone had any tips? Busybee: If it's an abcess you can usually feel it by touching the root at the front above the gum line.  The root is usually tender or feels different from the other teeth when touched.  Is the pain worse on waking or later in the day?  Try to relax your jaw during the day. Kaitlyn: Pain is definitely more prominent in the morning. The dentist gave me a steroid pack to take, and it has seemed to help a little, but there’s still pain. Has somewhat moved into my neck and shoulder now. Sometimes my neck will stiffen and feel like muscles are having a spasm. Today, I notice there is a tooth in the back that is sensitive when pushed on. It hasn’t been giving me any problems. Gums around it aren’t red, there’s no blisters or bumps around it, no real “toothache” ... I have no idea. Busybee: You might be bruising the tooth when you sleep.  Do you wear a nightguard?   Why are you still waiting for a crown to be fitted?  You won't really know exactly where your bite is at until you have the work completed.   Is the crown to be fitted next to the tooth that is sore when pushed on?  Or is it that the tooth to be crowned?It does seem that the work you had done has changed your bite.  The worst thing to do is for the dentist to start changing the other side.   I'd suggest you get them to make you a nightguard to take pressure off when you sleep (if you're waking in pain that means you're grinding at night).  Try to relax your jaw in the day.   Get  a second opinion.   It may be that you just need an adjustment or for the crown that's being made to be designed so that it stabilises the left side.I do sometimes wonder whether dentists have a problem with certain sides of the mouth because they often work from the right side and they will be either left or right handed.    Some dentists are just better at doing fillings and making sure the bite is aligned well than others.  They certainly used to train them better to do this.   Maybe it's just that composite is a lot harder to work with than amalgam but I didn't have any problems myself with amalgam fillings.   I'm assuming your fillings are composite.  A nasty material for back teeth I think but it's the only one that is used by most dentists these days."

It does say on the bottle I have that it has a antiseptic like in versions of listerine and because of that I am weary, also because by using chlorhexidine without knowing the truth about what it does to my gums or the body, I do not want to risk damaging my teeth/losing my teeth and major gum receedence to where I loose my gums all the way by using this. I think I already have gingivitis or something similar and my gums have wore down on some of my teeth. Uptown101: Chlorhexidine is known to treat gingivitis, just use it well. Be reminded that this will may stain your dentures, teeth, tongue or tooth restorations. pearly whites: Ok so let me get this straight. are you saying that it does cure/fix gingervites 100% completely after using it just once or a certain amount of times?  If not then what does it do? or what do you mean by \"TREAT\" it. Are you a dentist? Jagdeep Sibia: Chlorhexidine is an antibacterial rinse and therefore it does treat gingivitis in conjunction with brushing and flossing. Be reminded to use chlorhexidine only for 2 weeks at a time as it is linked to cause staining of teeth. pearly whites: Ok so does Chlorohexidine cure gingivitis 100% YES? or NO? that's all I need to know about that. either a yes or a no, it's simple."

I'd like to replace those fillings for aesthetics considerations and also to extend my teeth lifetime.May I consider ceramic inlays instead of amalgam or composite? can I fill my teeth with veneer? I want the best possibility regardless of the cost.Thanks. Busybee: They would normally replace with composite.  But changing so many fillings could affect your bite.   Amalgam fillings are extremely long lasting if done well. depaul: Thanks my friend.\nAs far as I know dentistry has evolved drastically in the last decade.\nDo you know that veneer/porcelain/ceramic is as much as strong as amalgam, and much much stronger that composite?Do you know that teeth crown are made of veneer? and usually last more than a decade? Busybee: You can't replace a filling with a veneer.  A veneer is like an eggshell bonded to the front of a tooth to make it look pretty.  It can be very strong when bonded by a good dentist but it is never strong like a natural cusp.    I think you must mean a porcelain onlay?  But a decade isn't a long time compared to amalgam.  Most people have/had amalgam all their lives if made well.    I'm sure there is a big industry in ceramics and restorative materials.  But at the end of the day it's all down to the skill of the dentist, the quality of the impressions taken, the skill and understanding of the technician.  Your bite, your self-care and genetics all play a major factor too.    The biggest issue can be changing the bite with replacing so much dental work.   It can totally mess up the equilibrium in your mouth.    There are risks to the health of the tooth.  You can end up with root failure when you over-treat teeth. John Roberts: I am having difficulty with my bite and all my teeth killing me especially when I eat or swallow.  Every time you swallow your teeth touch and mine hurt every time.  I have been to 9 or so different dentist and have had no help yet.  I guess what I am saying is I wouldn't do ANYTHING that could change my bite unless absolutely necessary. Jagdeep Sibia: I wouldn't recommend changing your silver fillings unless the fillings are falling apart and need to be replaced. I believe in the saying \"don't fix it if it ain't broken\"."

Getting braces will definitely help with your overbite though. If you just want braces for cosmetic reasons you could always look into getting porcelain veneers. Get a consultation with your dentist and they can discuss it in more detail with you and will probably have other options as well. drmins: Yes. You badly need orthodontic treatment.\nBraces in a case like this will not only help enhance your smile, but also help achieve a better facial profile. I would strongly recommend you not to delay your treatment. Jagdeep Sibia: From your pictures I can notice that you have a deepbite and crowding. You definately should get an orthodontic consultation and consider getting braces. It will improve your facial profile and you will be required to wear retainers after the orthodontic treatment in completed, therefore your teeth will not move back."

    "dialogue": "Chomp: Hi. My first post on here. Thanks in advance to anyone who can provide an answer.I've have had a dental implant (premolar) done over a few months, finishing today with the fitting of the crown,In grinding down the crown to get the bite right, my dentist has exposed the metal under the porcelain on the biting surface of the crown. He mentioned it while I was in the chair and said that it won't show. But it does show, it looks like a old metal filling, not what I expected from an expensive implant (this dentist is not by any means cheap and markets himself on quality)My query though is this, does the exposed metal present a potential health issue to me or a structural integrity issue to the crown itself?  I intend to ask him to put this right but don't know if it can be effectively repaired or if it will require a completely new crown. I have a follow up appointment in two weeks and will bring it up then.Thanks again, in advance. Dipsey: It's a mess he needs to give you a new crown. Structure is compromised and will harbor infection. KVMCruces: I'm a little late to this but that's definitely a big problem! You should NOT have a PFM crown that has metal exposed from your dentist adjusting the occlusion. He needs to send the crown back to the dental lab and have it remade. Not only can the crown now harbor infection but its also seriously harmful to your surrounding natural teeth.Also PFM restorations are old news. Dental technology and materials are advancing and there are PLENTY of full ceramic restorations available that will look better aesthetically and won't leave an ugly dark rim from the metal. Chomp: Thanks for replies. The problem was resolved when the crown came off and I swallowed it. New one made free of charge and all good now.Thanks again. KVMCruces: Glad to hear you got it resolved. I hope the old crown that was swallowed has also passed haha. Chomp: I confess, I didn’t go looking for it KVMCruces: I don't blame you!

It was a fairly large filling that covered nearly half my tooth as I lost it a good 10+ years ago from chewing on a skittle.Long story short, I am new to the area and haven't found a dentist and chose a place that was convenient for me location and time wise.I get in and she tells me that I can no longer do a filling (apparently too worn down or something along that line) and that a cap/crown is my only option. I unfortunately get suckered into it and just go ahead and let them prepare me for the work... fast forward to the middle of my appointment, she had noticed my front tooth had a root canal a long time ago and suggested I cap the tooth as well as it is pretty discolored now from being dead..I say nah thank you, I've lived with it for 20 years I'll be fine. Not taking no for an answer she all of a sudden says to me, throw that cap out the window, you need surgery immediately. She says I have an infection and need it drained asap.

    "title": "Bite issues, anxiety, no solutions seem practical",
    "dialogue": "Dental Impatient: This is a long story. I didn't go to a dentist for a while (from 18 to 25) and I ended up with a lot of large cavities. I'm 35 now. I went to a dentist who did all the filling work (19 teeth) at once, and ever since I've had bite issues. Over the years I would go back to him complaining of tooth pain, and he would do a bite adjustment and I'd be fine for a while. Over time, I feel like this made my bite worse. There are other factors that have led to bite issues, like nail biting and general anxiety. I'm more vigilant about care now, and have less general issues like fillings being needs, mostly I'm fighting the damage that was already done. Over the years my situation has gotten worse. I have three crowns on the upper and a lot of large fillings. I had a lower tooth, that had had two root canals, three crowns, over past 10 years and was finally pulled two months ago. After I needed my third root canal, I left that dentist and tried new options. The next place I went to proposed a grand plan to replace my bite. He wanted to crown all of my back teeth (16 at the time, 15 now) at once, giving me a new bite. Total for that would be around 13000 dollars, which is reasonable for what it is, but obviously I wanted some second opinions. This place boasted the CEREC machine and same day crowns, etc. He even claimed he could crown all the teeth in one session. This is neither here nor there, but I found him to be cocky and off putting, his billing department was very pushy, and he often delegated to dental assistants things I feel that he should have been doing. Anyway, needless to say I left and sought another option. The place I'm at currently, his plan sounds more reasonable, but I'm still wary about it. I want to get an implant (for tooth 19 which was recently pulled). He made me a retainer to wear in the meantime. He feels that my bite issues are complicated, and is proposing a 4000 dollar plan to adjust all my back teeth in one session to better alleviate my bite, but this would be \"stage 1\". He says that the last guy's plan to raise and crown all the back teeth was terrible, because my front teeth don't touch each other. \"Stage 2\" would be around 6000 dollars (and not at all covered by insurance since it's semi-healthy front teeth) and would involve some sort of crowning/veneering on the front teeth to allow them to touch and guide for the bite. On top of all this, I need to get the implant sooner than later to avoid bone loss. He doesn't want to do a crown for 19 with my current bite though.The tidal force of my bite is extreme. Multiple dentists have been shocked by it. I've bitten off crowns, I've bitten through the porcelain on the one that was on 19. I broke part of an empress crown almost immediately. I certainly believe I could loosen an implant.I'm at a loss for what to do. This guy certainly seems like he knows more what he's talking about, but my fear is I'll go in and have 12000 dollars worth of work, and in the process there will be new complications and new work needed, and it's going to just continue to cause anxiety and dental pain until I eventually lose all my teeth anyway.Is this new guy on the level? Are there any options for me that don't involve tons of work and tons of money? Busybee: HI Dental impatient.  You have my sympathies.  I too have a bite problem that's been extremely difficult to fix.  I too have always had a hard bite.  I haven't damaged any back teeth myself but dentists have damaged them.    I'd say from my own experience that your current dentist is right about the first guy.   Sticking all those crowns in same day would have caused no end of trauma.   Plus all that crown work could lead to more root canals and lost teeth.   I'm not a fan of adjustments because it's extremely difficult to replicate the natural bite that you grew into.  It's really the dentist who did the fillings that's at fault for ruining yours.    I don't know the state of your front teeth, but crowning natural teeth that are healthy would weaken them.  Veneers to help bite sounds odd to me.    He should try to build them up with composite temporarily to see how your bite tolerates the change.   He sounds sensible because although I don't have an implant I've read that you cannot put too much load on one.    But in terms of the bite adjustment I'd ask him if you can have it done very very slowly, maybe one or two teeth at a time and to stop if it's not helping.   The retainer is a good idea.    Do you grind at night or get ringing in your ears?  Do you have a clicky jaw? Dental Impatient: I grind a lot. I do grind when I sleep. I do not believe that I have TMJ. I'm still getting adjusted to the retainer. The main reason he wants to hit the front teeth it because they don't touch each other, and they don't \"guide\" the bite well. I think the veneers were more a \"while we're here let's make them look better\" suggestion. If bite adjustments could be done peace-meal I would have done it via insurance over the years, but the only answer I ever get from dentists is that it has to be done all at once. Busybee: Veneers are not a great suggestion if you have a bite problem.   They weaken the tooth."

They filed so low it didnt show on contact paper but the doc okayed the work and offered to file my canines.Furious, I Got a 2nd opinion who said the two teeth werent touching & re did the fillings.  One in between filling was now two.  Filled them so high i spent mult. trips to get it fixed. They didnt want to adjust much and werent very helpful so I had my old ortho look at it. He filed a high spot.Tried showing my retainer.  Its like an invisilign and with every detail. I know it cant be the exact same again but get you can at least compare After the high fillings it would pop off but not the too low ones.Bite worse than ever and hurting I called the original office back and demanded the head guy fix it not the one who okayed the bad work. He filed one spot and said i may need to come back. It felt great for a day and then went back to hurting and off.  I called back but he was on vacay for a MONTH.  The only head guy there was the one who okayed the bad work.Frustrated, I went back to my ortho because i didnt trust anyone else.  He did another tiny filing but it felt like a drastic difference.  Hes said see an actual dentist. It felt more normal but i now hurt more.Im now at almost two months of adjustments.  Mouth hurting to the point of insanity and mentally drained.  But my bite HAS to be fixed. Its all i think about all day.Went back to the original dentist that day the one okaying bad work. I couldnt wait and couldnt keep leaving work.

Scared to get 3rd opinion and they file too low and have to get it filled a 3rd time.  Scared to go back to the original dentist.  Retainer fits but now.   The side ive had work on feels lower than the good side like all my teeth are on an angle almost or just a sunken feeling...does that mean it too low again?!?!? Or maybe i gkt used to the fillings being too high?   So how would my mouth feel on teeth 13 and 12 and what teeth should touch if it was high vs if it was low? Should i see someone else? Its friday night i cant make it to Monday like this. I may go to a saturday dentist but its one of those dentist chains called dental excellence. I dont want to make things worse but im desperate. And cant keep leaving work to go to a normal dentist during the week.  Im a single mom taking care of a one year old and im exhausted and cant just go to the dentist whenever i wan.\n Please help me get out of this nightmare im close to having a meltdown. Busybee: Dear Megalo.  I am really sorry you are going through this.  I've been through a similar problem myself and all I can say is that once a dental professional has adjusted your bite in this way it is nigh on impossible to fix.   If you carry on you will diagnosed with a \"sensitive bite\" even though you never had a problem with it until you went to the dentist!  I'm afraid dentists are happy to create the problem, but there is no easy solution.    One thing you must stop is having more adjustments to file your teeth down.  If they file down actual tooth there is no way to really replace them as nature created them.  I'd suggest you go to a dentist who can make you a hard dental splint to wear at night.  This will give you some relief when you sleep and should relax your jaw muscles over that time.   If properly made, it should work better than the retainer.  You should maybe try to wear it in the day.  You only have so much natural tooth, don't let anyone take any enamel down.   Try to relax your jaw muscles by not letting the teeth touch when you close your mouth.   Get a bite analysis done with study models that examine which teeth are hitting too much.  Unfortunately there is no quick fix.  You have to try to relax the jaw and manage the anxiety while you get treated.  It's extremely frustrating that dentists can create such problems but having any dental work is always a risk.  Your bite is important on so many levels and changing it can not only cause frustration and pain, but can affect digestion, and general health.  You need to accept that this will take time to fix and that you need to see someone who is a specialist."

    "title": "Molar with Big Composite Filling",
    "dialogue": "dan_russ: Hi There!Just wondering if anyone can help. Just seeking independent random advice I've got a molar with a large composite filling... done roughly 2 years ago. Now when it was done, my dentist warned me it was very close to the nerve.... I've previously managed to crack an older filling and snap off one of those pointed parts of the molar, and as a result this was done. That tooth since has been very annoying. It was painful for weeks after the procedure and never could take a lot of bite pressure again. It did settle down though. I just didn't chew hard with that part of the mouth since. Well, I am now seemingly going through the same process again.About 5 days ago I woke up at night with massive jaw ache. I couldn't figure out what it even was at first, so here is how it went:Day 1. Had massive lower jaw ache and couldn't figure out what it was all day. Tried chewing hard on the teeth on the affected side, but didn't figure out which tooth it was. Just sat with a hot water bottle and aspirin tablets all day.\nDay 2. The jaw ache subsided and the pain was now concentrated on that lower molar. Couldn't even meet the lower/upper jaw together without major pain. Constant dull ache, sharp pain... all kinds... with or without stimuli... I thought it was infected. I didn't have the time to get to my dentist to get antibiotics, so just started eating massive amounts of garlic to see if it worked. Started taking aspirin + codeine tablets for the pain.\nDay 3. Still lots of pain with no stimuli, but less.\nDay 4. Got slightly better, but still random pain flaring up.\nDay 5 (Today). I stopped the pain killers and only have pain after leaving a lot of cold water in the mouth or if I try to chew on it hard. If I don't do anything or chew hard, there is no pain.It's pretty much of a repeat of what I've been through when the procedure was done years ago.I am wondering what to do with this? I am in Sydney / Aus, where complex dental procedures are extremely expensive.... Would leaving it be for another week to see if settles down completely be a good idea... should I get some antibiotics? Is there a proper way to test if it's even alive... I read about reversible/irreversible pulpits and not sure where I fit, as  I have been through this cycle before and it got better last time.  Or should I get it pulled, and save up for a replacement tooth? I am not too keen on root canals, some family members have had bad experiences where the dead tooth just disintegrates later and causes more problems.Best Regards,\nDan calcium48: I can feel your pain.\nimplants can be very expensive as well.\nNothing will be as good as your original teeth Dipsey: A root canal is a last resort for pain management. Sounds like you are getting close to needing one. Either you pull it or root canal depends if you have the money to plug the gap. Root canals not all bad can be trouble free for decades but yes it's like a dead tree stump left behind. Busybee: It can take quite a while for some fillings or crowns to settle down.   I once had pain for about three months with an onlay but now it's fine.  It's best not to worry too much and just wait a few weeks,  If the root dies there is often a pain  or soreness when you press the outside root.  I once had a cracked tooth that one dentist wanted to root fill (it was extremely painful when I ate hot food).  But I went for a second opinion and another dentist fixed it with filling.  It was sensitive for a while but fine for ten years now.  The dentist that filled it said that if you feel cold (like cold water on a cotton bud) then the nerve is still alive.  If it fails you won't see it for a couple of months, but hopefully yours will settle.  Go easy on the grinding.  You can also try to very very gently bite down on a cotton bud to see if it's tender.  If you get a really sharp pain that's a sign it's not in good shape.  Thing is that if the nerves are close they don't have to remove the whole filling.  Leaving part in situ can help save the tooth from trauma.  It's not ideal practice apparently but better than needing root treatment.  You should get a second opinion.   Perhaps it's just needs a slight adjusment and some sensitive toothpaste."

    "title": "Dental nightmare, pain, now 3 dentists refusing to treat me",
    "dialogue": "Tone-Analyst: About a year ago I checked in at the dentist with swollen glands and pain around my 2nd molar. I have a wisdom tooth buried deep in there so dentist figured it must be the issue (X-ray showed nothing, no abcess). That took a few months to heal. Then the pain remained the same so I returned. The filling on the 1st molar looked a bit crusty so he replaced it. Still same. Now I'm 100% certain the pain comes from the 2nd molar. Dentist tells me the pain is probably psychological, that there is nothing there. Refuses to extract or perform a root canal. I saw another dentist, a parodontist, an endodontist. They tell me there is nothing a refuse to do anything. Do I have to go to a 3rd world country to have that 2nd molar pulled? Busybee: Hi Tone Analyst.  It could be a bite problem that's causing the pain.  But if you extract or have unnecessary work done on the tooth your bite could get worse and you could end up with pain elsewhere too  So I understand and sympathise with how you feel, but with teeth things can only get worse once you start removing them or even after having work done.   Have you tried a night guard to see if taking pressure off the tooth reduces the pain?   I wouldn't recommend you have any adjustments until you have the pain diagnosed.  I would definitely advise not having any type of equilibriation as this can destroy your bite.   But you should try a bite guard first.  The other thing it could be is that you have ghost pain from the wisdom tooth you had removed.  A nerve could have been damaged by that tooth.  I do not believe dental pain is ever psychological.  There is a condition but it is extremely rare.   Dentists tend to use this diagnosis when they don't know what's happening.    It's the gland issue that makes me wonder about the bite because I've had similar pain because of bite (was also told the psychological story) but it was eased by a very slow and cautious approach."

    "dialogue": "Torbin12: So.  In a way to not downplay it any, I have nearly a lifetime of horrible dental hygiene practices.  Before maybe the last year or so, I only rarely brushed, almost never flossed, and only usually used listerene occasionally and I avoid dentist visits with an ardent passion like my survival somehow depended on it.   My teeth have, obviously, been decaying quite a bit, but even when the decaying started, that still wasn't enough to convince me to change my ways.  Around a year, maybe a year and a half ago, my gums where my teeth met  would start bleeding if I did nearly anything, from spitting, to biting into soft bread, even talking in certain ways could make my gums start bleeding.  At that time, thats when I realized, I REALLY needed to salvage what little bit I could.  I started brushing regularly a couple times a week, which I had to do because brushing would, also, cause my gums to bleed.  Over the last year, I have managed to build up to being able to brush at least twice a day, with little to no gum bleeding under almost any normal conditions at all.   Until now, my brushing is always done solely with clean, fresh water, because I don't know the answer to the titular question.  With teeth that at a relatively (I think) moderately high level of decay, would toothpaste and specifically a flouride-based toothpaste, be....\"good\" for my teeth, or with a moderately high level of decay, would it do even more damage?     As a veteran, I have started planning to visit a Dental Clinic of some sort and face the music, to find out what my future options are for.Thank you for any time spent on this topic."

The local chemist gave me cotton pads and told me to roll one up and it should be fine.\nSo a week passes and I have been rinsing with salt water and haven't once touched the extraction site with my tongue as i've been extremely worried about knocking the clot and getting a dry socket. yesterday i touched the site with my tongue and it felt rough and I had assumed it was a scab until I swilled my mouth out and a ball of browny red fell out into the sink. This ball was made up of little fibers from the cotton pad and touching the site with my tongue I can still feel more of these fibers but are'nt able to nudge them loose. I've carefully pulled as muh out as I could with tweasers but some still remains.\nMy question is will my body push it out or will my gum heal over with the fibers inside?\nShould I still be worried about a dry socket after a week?\nAlso could there be any side effects to having this sat in my gum for a whole week? \nI can't find anyone who's had a similar situation online really so I appreciate anyone who takes their time to read my post and offer advise.

I don't want to be an RDA forever and so I have a plan to become a dentist one day. The thing is I'm not sure exactly which route I want to go and I'm hoping I can get some feedback from fellow dentists who can shed some light. See, I'm thinking of becoming a telecommuting dentist because I want to do the following:\n1) Travel. I don't want to just stick to one office, location, etc. \n2) Have a flexible schedule. I don't want to work weekends and I want to be able to fix up my own schedule.\n3) Be my own boss. I want to just go in, do my work, and leave. I don't want to take orders from any other dentist or help clean rooms, etc.\n4) Not deal with the stress of owning a dental practice NOR dealing with the stress of working for a company/corporate office. \nI'm not sure exactly what the pros & cons are for a telecommuting dentist; obviously I'm only guessing what I believe might be things to think about. There might be something I'm missing. I want to be allowed the freedom that I may not get working at an office or corporate. I work for a corporate office right now (before that I worked at a private office) so I have an idea of what I do and don't want. I want to travel, afford a truck (my dream car lol), be able to treat myself (and my family) to vacations sometimes, not live paycheck to paycheck, and just live a comfortable life.

Two and one half years ago my mother had to have some surgery which left her unable to walk and  bedridden. Because she cannot go to the bathroom by herself her oral healthcare habits have not been good. I have explained to her about the need to have good oral hygiene and tried to get the caregivers to brush her teeth every day but since I am not with her everyday I'm not sure it gets done. She also suffers from dementia but still communicates adequately. My mother is also a Denti-cal patient.  I've tried to get her to see several dentists since she became bedridden but few take Denti-cal and even fewer can accommodate her in a wheel chair. My mother must be lifted out her wheel chair with a Hoyer lift and into a dentist chair. I finally found a dentist with large enough exam rooms to accommodate her wheelchair and lift.   The exam revealed that she had moderately bad periodontal disease and needs several extractions because of decayed teeth.\nShe has already had several extractions and if the decayed teeth are removed she would only have a few teeth in the front, both top and bottom. The dentist has suggested that she either have partials or full dentures. The dentist seems to think she has enough good teeth left for the partial to attach to if that is what we decide to do. My mother and I have talked and I gave her what I think are the pros and cons of either treatment plan.I am torn about what to do, partial or full dentures. This is what I am thinking:  I think that a partial would preserve some of her teeth and would be more secure than full dentures, but she would have to improve her oral hygiene habits so that she doesn't lose any more teeth. I just don't think she will improve her oral hygiene and all of the dental work would be wasted. I don't know how good a full denture would perform (how well can they fit a full denture these days) and how comfortable would they be. The full denture would be easier to care for and I think she could eliminate the periodontal disease. Any advise would be welcomed!"

I looked up the video on youtube and was surprised to find that the skin graft method was more complicated and cringe-worthy than I thought it was. The pinhole method made me cringe as well, although maybe not quite as much. I can see how you would think it wouldn't work in my case. It looks like there would have to be more gum in that area than I have.Are you a dentist? Do you know why some kind of a coating couldn't be applied to the exposed root area to prevent it from being exposed? I'm thinking that such a coating could be a replacement for the gum there. So far, I haven't heard that anywhere as an alternative. Erosion: James Gordan said: No, I'm not a dentist. I was told back in 2012 (when I had adult braces) that I might need to get gum grafting done since my orthodontist was not sure how the end result would be but everything worked itself out and it turns out I didn't need it. I was doing research (like yourself) to find alternatives and that's when I came across Dr.Chao.If I do remember correctly, Dr.Chao does teach and certify dentist across the globe on how to do this procedure, you can contact his office and ask if there is anyone certified in Wisconsin and they'll provide you with a list of dentist.As far as applying a coating, I've personally never heard of this but maybe a dentist can chime in and clarify. Click to expand... It sounds like you and I are in the same boat! I had adult braces as well, and my hygienist says that those were most likely the reason for the gum recession I have. She looked back in her records which go back 3 years, and she said that the gum level for that tooth is at the same place now as it was 3 years ago, which is at 6mm. She said that if it goes down just another 2mm, it would lead to exposure of an area that would cause infection and then tooth loss of my lower teeth. That made me nervous.The fact that you said you had adult braces too and have suffered the same result and that everything worked itself out gives me hope. I got braces when I was 34, had them removed at age 36, and now I'm 45. It would seem that the recession is the result of having braces rather than a lack of gum care on my part. But now the gum line for that tooth is so much lower down than for the surrounding teeth that it makes it harder to brush at the base of that tooth where plaque builds up. At my last checkup, it was shown to me that I wasn't doing a good enough job of brushing there. So now I'm trying harder, but I have to be careful to not brush it too much lest I wear it down myself. Erosion: James Gordan said: There were a few things that I was doing at the time my orthodontist notified me about my gums receding to prevent it from getting worse and inevitably stopping it completely. I was oil pulling, (this is questionable on if this works or not) because there is no scientific evidence proving that it does. Oil pulling has been used in India for thousands of years and some people swear by it. It's believed to help remove toxins from your gums as well as helping gum recession (subtly). The second thing I was using was essential oxygen mouth wash: https://essentialoxygen.com/, I still use it today and it's the only mouth wash I'll probably ever use because it uses H202 which is hydrogen peroxide and it doesn't contain any unhealthy ingredients such as \"saccharin\"(causes battler cancer in animals) which is found in products like Listerine. You will rarely find mouthwashes in stores that use H202, Why? I don't know. The hydrogen peroxide that's being used in their formula is food grade hydrogen peroxide (3% if I'm not mistaken) and if you don't know about the power of food grade hydrogen peroxide you should do a bit of research, It does a great job at killing bad bacteria and I honestly believe this is what stopped my gum recession from getting worse. The lady who created this mouth wash did so because of this very reason, due to her having gum recession as well as bleeding while flossing (this used to happen to me but not anymore), visit the website and you can read her story below. I was seeing a periodontist at the time I had my braces (recommended to me by my orthodontist) he was telling me that I had periodontal pockets due to the gum recession, (I no longer have these anymore).The third thing I was using (which I plan on buying another one) is a waterpik https://www.waterpik.com/oral-health/, it goes down deep in your gums using water and helps remove any bad bacteria, food, etc... that dental floss cannot reach. According to clinical studies it's 51% more effective than dental floss. I purchased mine at Walgreens, (I don't know if you have one near you).The fourth thing is I only brush my teeth using Dr.Tung's Ionic Tooth brush (far better than any spin brush if you ask me), it reverses the polarity of the teeth (temporarily) causing plaque to easily be removed. Most people don't know about these ionic tooth brushes but they are very effective, here is a study published about it: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11830911. Over 30 million have been sold in Japan, Europe, and the USA.Last but not least I use Dr.Tung's \"Stainless Steel Tongue Scraper\" (plastic tongue scrapers tend to retain bacteria)Those were the only three things I was (and still am) using and thus far my receding has stopped, no more pockets and it's been 5 years now.Hope this helps. NOTE: I have no affiliation with any of the recommended products, these are simply products that I use. Click to expand... I used to use something very similar to the Waterpik. It was the same thing but made by a different company. I used that when I had braces and it was great for getting loose food from under the braces. It eventually wore out. Maybe it's time for another one.I was using hydrogen peroxide as a rinse for a while, but my hygienist told me that I shouldn't do that because it harms the teeth. I have to wonder about that. Some articles found online seem to indicate that it may be true: http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/hydrogen-peroxide-mouthwash-harmful-teethI do have those periodontal pockets you mentioned. It would be nice to get those taken care of. svor1988: Do you have any lip piercings?Is this genetic predisposition? Do any of your ancestors have this?Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis? Trench mouth?Is the tooth dead? Gums will recede from dead teeth, implants, and root-canal treated teeth.Yes hydrogen peroxide can be very acidic depending on the concentration, look at its pH.Dentin has a critical pH of 6.7.Cementum also has a critical pH of 6.7.Natural enamel (Hydroxylapatite) has a critical pH of 5.5.Fluoride treated enamel (Fluorapatite) has a critical pH of 4.5.Lactic acid has a pH of 3.51.Lactic acid is largely what causes cavities, due to the fermentation of sugar and starch by naturally occurring bacteria after 4-5 hours.Your cementum is exposed so stay away from anything acidic, and clean your teeth/mouth within 1-4 hours of eating. Stay away from candy/soda.Recent breakthroughs in the engineering oral mucosa have been made. Commercially available materials can help treat gum recession. Ask your periodontist if they recommend any of these products. It's a field still very much in development. Erosion: I don't have any lip piercings, and as far as I know, there's no genetic predisposition in my family for gum recession. I haven't been diagnosed with trench mouth or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. My tooth is not dead; it's still vital. I will talk to my periodontist about these new commercial materials that you mentioned. Thanks for the information!"

I had noticed a little bleeding but thought nothing of it. She told me that I should use interdental picks insead of the interdental brushes and that would clear it up.The picks are definitely working better - at least, I think they must be because my gums have been bleeding A LOT since I started using them (which I do twice a day). The hygienist told me that they would stop bleeding within 10 days, but it is now a month later and despite bleeding less they have not stopped bleeding.I went to the dentist yesterday and he told me to use corsodyl mouthwash for two weeks and then come in for a clean (I don’t have any vsible plaque, but apparently there is a little under my gums).I feel really scared because if I have gum disease despite such good oral hygiene, I don’t know what more I can do to stop it progressing into peridontonitis.What could be going on here?"

    "dialogue": "Jax2: Hi all ...I am wondering if I am the only one this happens to, or if there is some weird connection between time of day and pain in your teeth. Let me start by mentioning, I have very bad teeth. They are very brittle and tend to break easily, so I have dealt with many, many tooth infections, and severe pain, for most of my adult life. It's misery.Over the years, I have had a very, very strange phenomena I cannot explain. With a few exceptions, between waking, and around 10 pm at night, my teeth do not hurt, or at least, hurt very little compared with later. After 10, usually between 10 pm and 4 am, when I have an infection, or an exposed nerve ...etc, the pain is excruciating. I understand that lying down causes fluids to build up in the roots of your teeth, which can lead to severe pain if you have an exposed root, but that is not the issue here. It does not matter if I am lying down, standing up, doing jumping jacks, or working nights. As soon as 10 pm rolls around, my affected teeth hurt terribly. Lying down simply exacerbates that pain 10 fold. Can anyone point out a possible cause for teeth to only hurt at night / early mornings, yet not during the rest of the day? Uptown101: Another cause for late night toothaches can be due to grinding your teeth when stressed throughout the day and is due to blood flow when you lie down."

Now the tooth had a root canal done years ago.  He cannot X-ray through the crown so he doesn't know if there is decay or not.   \nIt will cost about $2000 since my delta dental insurance does not cover crowns.  My friend recently visited the same dentist a few days ago and he mentioned the she would need 4 crowns replaced for the same reason.   We are both in our mid 60s and wonder if this is a good idea to have the crowns replaced or just take the chance.   Any advice would be appreciated.   \nThanks so much\nJerry Dasha: Jerry- schedule with another dentist in your area. Most insurances will cover a free exam and it's worth asking around a few other offices to see other opinions. There's a possibility he could be correct, but it does seem a little unusual he said the same thing to a friend of yours. Dipsey: If there is no pain and not unsightly you can have any decayed  margins resealed with flowable composite then it should last for many more years.

I am very nervous of the dentist the last time having a panic attack there so I am putting off going. When I went last it was about 8 months ago as all my bottom teeth were aching they recommended I had a deep clean which I then did the same day, since then my teeth have been terrible. My back tooth has weakened and completely broken and now it's sharp and extremely wobbly but I am terrified to have it removed that part of my gum is very red and swollen. The main problem is my front four teeth at the bottom since the clean one has moved to go almost sideways and is pushing one of the middle teeth backwards I looked in the mirror yesterday and as I pushed them they are wobbling and constancy throbbing and my gums hurt although they aren't red. Am I going to loose my teeth will the wobbling get worse or will it fix itself? I haven't been sleeping and I have nightmares every night that I've lost my teeth I have been an awful state this week. Thanks in advance, Kim Dasha: Kim, you're best option is to go to your dentist. There is nothing home remedies can do. This sounds like a case of periodontal disease and it should be something you should be keeping regular maintenance on. It's unlikely the cleaning is what caused the severity of these problems. Sorry to hear you are suffering, just remember your dental office is only looking out for you. Dipsey: Ask to have your lower fronts bonded in a bridge to keep them fixed in place using ribbond and composite. It's a cheap quick procedure and can last for many years sometimes to stop those wobbly teeth falling out."

    "dialogue": "CocoKennedy: Hi. I have four molars that my dentist said need extracting. I was born with no enamel on my teeth so a few of them are quite decayed. The others are in perfect condition, however. It's just the back four. I am incredibly embarrassed about them and want them gone, but have been putting the procedure off for years and putting up with the pain as I'm extremely anxious about having them removed. I know that I wouldn't be so anxious about having them filled or having a crown, as it's the blood and open wounds that I am most afraid of. Do you think any other dentist would try to repair them. My top right tooth, which is decayed down to the gum and has an abscess. will definitely need extracting as it is far gone, but the others are mostly still white and don't look all too bad :/ The top left has been cracked away about half way to the gum line and has a large cavity in half of the tooth, my bottom left has a large cavity in the right of it, but it's not causing any pain and most of the tooth is still there. Then I just have a normal cavity on the bottom right which could be filled but my dentist wants to extract it to even everything out. The X-rays of the roots look normal except for the top right, which as I stated, would need removing. I would post an image but I don't know how. Please be nice, I'm extremely self conscious of my teeth and this is the first time I'm sharing this with anyone except my dentist Chomp: Hi. I'm not a dentist and have not had anything like the trouble you describe. I have been very lucky with my teeth generally but started to have problems with one premolar two or three years ago. I put up with multiple infections, the pain was horrible, more than once, late at night, I was seriously considering pulling the bloody thing about myself with pliers, it was that bad. unable to sleep. Went though some periods of not being able to eat solid food. The tooth appeared fine so the dentist advised against extraction, hoping it would settle down. It didn't and eventually a crack appeared right across the top, it tuned out it had started to crack from the root upwards and took over a year to present on the surface. X-rays didn't show it.The extraction was pretty easy. I didn't actually realise the tooth was out. It came out split in two though which might have helped. Yes there was blood, but not huge amounts and the hole plugged up in a day or two and healed completely within a fortnight. A little pain but certainly manageable. The implant process was more tiresome than painful.  The actual process of placing the implant in my jaw took an hour or so. It was a bit uncomfortable but not traumatic, little pain after and again, manageable with paracetamol.I had the crown installed yesterday. There is a small cosmetic issue with it (described in a post I made last night) but notwithstanding that I am pleased that I had the implant done.I suspect that the corresponding tooth on the other side of my mouth is going to go the same way and if it does I won't hesitate to have it extracted and implanted at a much earlier stage than the first one.Don't let fear stop you from ending the pain and misery of bad teeth.There's a Facebook chat group, \"Dental Implant Discussions\". It's a closed group, you have to ask to join, so it's not publicly visible. Lots of good info and advice there.  Best of luck. CocoKennedy: Thank you very much. I honestly don't think anything is going to get my in that chair though, I'll probably pass out before even entering the dentist office :/ Dipsey: Unfortunately no matter how bad your teeth are now they just get worse without help. Go have a chat to a dentist and he will explain what can be done and the possible procedures then give you time to think things over. Please do it as infections can be dire! Most pain of dentist is in the mind not in the chair."

    "dialogue": "SVNDR: Hi,I had 2 upper teeth extracted 3 days ago. I checked my mouth this morning to see how the healing process was going, instead I found this (photo attatched).Full details. Around the age of 14 one of my baby teeth became loose, over time the tooth never fell out. A year or so later a permanent tooth started breaking through the roof of my mouth just to the side of the baby tooth that never came out. Over time the baby tooth started to decay and chip away. I am now 22 and finally had both teeth removed.As you can see in the photo there is a lot of whiteness where I had both teeth removed. To the center of the edge of one of them, there seems to be a small hole that goes deep into the gum.I am not experiencing too much pain, no more then I expected anyway. I will be contacting my dentist tomorrow as today is a weekend.Any insight until then would be great.Thanks. Dipsey: It's healing so if not much pain leave it alone."

    "dialogue": "ByThe Numbers: Esteemed peers,I am writing to you for some advice on how to deal with low-paying insurances.  I have an economics/business background and I am evaluating a practice that accepts the full spectrum of dental insurances.  From what I see, the majority of the practice's patient body is comprised of those with low-paying insurances.  Obviously, to cover operating costs, a high patient count is needed when fee schedules are low.  Right now, I'm scratching my head on how this practice can actually make money.  By the numbers, rising lab fees and aggressively low contractual fees with certain insurances means that most major work yields very little profit.  When you subtract out material, utilities, and staff costs, it seems like the work is not worth the liability of completing major treatments.I've researched and heard of the following things other practices have implemented to survive this economic squeeze such as the following:- Use less costly materials (which can sadly affect treatment quality)\n- Negotiate lower lab fees\n- Charge an additional co-pay or material upgrade fee (some insurances do not like this)\n- Invest in marketing and attract more private insurance patients that have more palatable fee schedules\n- Negotiate fee schedules directly with insurance companiesI would love to hear of any war stories that you have had with regard to low-paying insurances and how you work with them, if you have utilized any of the tactics above, or if you found success in a different way.Thanks in advance,\nBTN calcium48: how much does it cost per hour to run a typical dental practice, just to break even?And what is the average cost per hour of an average dental practice? ByThe Numbers: calcium48 said:\t\t\thow much does it cost per hour to run a typical dental practice, just to break even?And what is the average cost per hour of an average dental practice?\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nI wish I had a better answer for you, but there are so many variables that can affect a general hourly cost. Here are a few that can change depending on the day:-how many associates, dental assistants, receptionists, hygienists a practice has working on a given day and what their wages are\n-the types of procedures being completed in a day and the required material costs (i.e. composite material, etch, bonding, lab fees for crowns/bridges/dentures)\n-the type of insurance of patients for the schedule if the associate is being paid by commission (if the patient is seeing low-pay insurances, then the cost is lower)Here are a few variables where the costs tend to stay around the same on a monthly basis:-Utilities (electricity, water, internet, dental software, phone)\n-Insurance (malpractice, office insurance, disability, maintenance fees, .etc)Unfortunately, this list is not comprehensive, but it should give you an idea of why it is difficult to predict an hourly cost to run an office.  All of these costly variables end up making it hard for practices to survive when contractual fee schedules are low. ...Which leads me back to my original reason for posting, which is, how have practices dealt with this when they do not have the luxury of plentiful high-paying insurance patients.  In order to break even, or to even see a little bit of the green pastures, it seems that practices have to play the numbers game and see a higher patient count.  Practices may have to also make some difficult decisions on which materials to use in order to make ends meet. calcium48: I realize that there will be many variables, that's why I said the  average costwhat is the average cost per hour of an average dental practice? ByThe Numbers: I'm sorry if I gave off the impression that I have data on hundreds of practices to extrapolate a legitimate answer.  Let me preface my response with the disclosure that I am not an expert and can only respond based off of what I've observed in my own experiences.That being said, if I were to estimate, it would be around the following:~$2000 - Daily cost\n~$225 - Hourly cost (9 hour day)This was compiled based off of the following working assumptions:- Staff wages (2 assistants, 1 receptionist, 1 lab technician, 1 office manager, 1 associate)\n- Lab costs and treatment materials\n- Utilities, maintenance/common charges, rentIf the above working assumptions qualify as what you deem an average practice, then you have your answer. calcium48: thanks.\nI know it's difficult to give an answer to this due to the number of variables involved.Perhaps other dentists can say what their real-life hourly rates are. ByThe Numbers: Sure - Calcium48.  I think your questions are worth exploring.  I am also curious to know about operating costs for other practices.  Perhaps you can open up a new thread to address your other financial questions practices face as it somewhat obscures the crux of the original post.  If you do, I'll be sure to follow and contribute where I can. ScreaminRay: ByThe Numbers said:\t\t\tEsteemed peers,I am writing to you for some advice on how to deal with low-paying insurances.

    "dialogue": "JayBee: Four days ago my gold crowned molar(#19) and my last tooth (#18) were heat and cold sensitive, pressure sensitive and throbbing with pain. I couldn’t tell if it was a problem with both teeth or just one.  Regardless, I had to avoid that side of my mouth totally (no food, no hot or cold beverage).  The crown is over 15 years old so I though decay had made it’s way through the tooth and the back tooth is mostly filling.  I didn’t know whether either was repairable and can’t afford to have them both pulled, losing the ability to chew on that side (and don’t have insurance to help out with implants).  Another tooth (#14 is my last tooth on top and part of a bridge) was also hurting and cold sensitive.  I seemed to have pain coming from all 3 teeth.  Then 3 days into this pain I could pinpoint the pain and it now seemed to be coming exclusively from #19.  The next morning (Sunday) I had no pain or sensitivity in any of the above mentioned teeth.  Like nothing had ever happened.  My only treatment was applying Oregano oil between the teeth and on gums daily.  Oregano has excellent antiseptic and antimicrobial  qualities,  Has anybody experienced this pain remission after 4 days and what could have caused pain?  Many thanks, Jeff."

At the oral surgeon's office, I was told my estimated after insurance cost would be around $1,500, which I paid on that day. Fast forward to recent weeks, when I checked my Aetna account, it appears I should be paying only $650. So I think I've over paid. Of course I have received no refunds from the oral surgeon yet. My question is, how should I proceed with this from now on? Should I get something like an official document from Aetna showing I'm only responsible for 650, not 1500?

Anyway during the appointment, they did the X-Rays using this round device they stuck in my mouth and I bit down on it.When I did X-Rays years ago I remember biting down on a smaller square shaped thing it was much easier, maybe this dentist office used old school stuff?Then the X-Rays did not come through, they did but not so clear due to their old school laptop not connecting to the device so well until it did connect. All and all they said my teeth were in good shape according to the X-Rays.Next up was the teeth cleaning with the paste which they did. Then I was told I needed a deep cleaning done and should get it done right away. The cost would be $200.00All in all this dentist place I did not like at all. And now I am afraid to get a deep cleaning done whether it'd be this same location or a new location. How much do deep cleaning's run, I've heard cheap ranging from $50-90 to $100-150 down to $200 and up. I also really do not want to throw up during the deep cleaning IF I do decide to do it.

    "dialogue": "Suzlq: I had my teeth cleaned aggressively by a sub hygienist, with no problems previously. Afterwards, (possibly) a week or so later I started noticing a sensation of food being stuck between my teeth, especially my lower front teeth, most likely due to my tongue resting there. There was and has not been any food stuck between my teeth! However the sensation is really throughout my mouth and teeth. In the meantime my tongue and mouth cavity has been suffering sensitivities as well. It has basically been a 24/7 issue for the past 2 1/2 months. I have been back to the dentist twice plus a periodontist referral of his. They both said my teeth and gums look great and I have no problems there. The last time my dentist took a couple of x-rays to compare before the cleaning and a couple months after the cleaning but he did not note any differences. I have chewed gum, sucked on regular and dry mouth lozenges, used Biotene, an oral rinse (Peridex) for a few days and Benzocaine for a few days. Nothing has solved the problems. I started a new daily medicine for  headaches, I believe, after the symptoms started. I thought possibly it could have contributed to \"dry mouth\" and my issues. I recently discontinued the med and am now on a new med that doesn't have the potential side effect of dry mouth. My dentist is stumped and told me he hopes it is better by the next time I get my next cleaning in November. Any ideas on why the sensation of the food between teeth and now the sensitivities within my mouth cavity including my tongue and roof of mouth? I'm not sure what to do next except give time to be on my new med and hope it was all a reaction some how to my new med. Any more visits to a professional are going to be out of pocket now."

He has asked me to wait and watch for the crown to fall off on its own. If he tries to take the crown out ..it may actually fracture the tooth. The tooth is  not that wobbly and it has been close to 6 days now. Please advise...i don't want to get an implant if it is avoidable..there is no bleeding or pain. David Ujcic: I'm in the same boat as you. I'm about to add my question post.  \nWhat I'd like to do is avoid implant at all costs.\nI'm ok with ignoring fracture.

David Ujcic: After researching glues, come to understand that the most likely glue used has been zinc phosphate glue which relies on good matching between surfaces.\nI am going to ask the dentist to source a good chemical bonding glue (Glass ionomer) rather than mechanical bonding. shikha: Well what if it is not that wobbly but sometimes you have pain for 5 minutes or so every 2-3 hours. It is manageable and can be ignored if your are busy with work. I am really nt sure to go for an implant as it is one of my front tooth. How long can we go on like this...."

Returned to the dentist after 1 week to have the socket scraped and new blood clot (ouch!) as well as packed with alvogyl. Then after another week the alvogyl paste came out and it became inflamed and painful so went back to the dentist. I wouldn't agree to any scraping on the 2nd visit, but she washed it with saline (not painful) and put a small amount of alvogyl and packed it loosely. I think today that packing has come out because it's inflamed again and starting to hurt.Anyone know how long this will go on? Should I return to the dentist for more alyoglyl? It does stop it hurting when the paste is in there, but does it delay the healing? Would I be better off taking iboprofun anti-inflammatory pills for a while and seeing if it fixes itself up faster? It seems like it will never heal. Why is it taking so long? Help!! Sofianhleihil: Hello Sewho,\nSorry to hear about your situation...\nI'm a dentistry student at the moment but I have some experience with this procedure.You need to know first which is the cause for the clot being constantly disloged, you should avoid rinsing too much as this can lead to complications (with the clot), another reason could be that a foreign body (a piece of the tooth was left behind, though I doubt that this is the cause, if the surgeon scraped the surface again, he/she should have notices if something was left behind), It can also cause an inflamation at that spot.As far as I know you might need antibiotics to treat the dry socket and hopefuly start the healing process.. you could ask the surgeon to place an antibiotic paste into the socket, and ask for his opinion on starting an antibiotic treatment.Hope this helps.\nGet healthy soon! sewho: Just finished my 2nd lot of antibiotics this morning. They did seem to help so maybe that was the problem. Have taken some iboprofun last night which settled it down a bit. Have to wait and see how it goes today I guess."

Would it still clot this long after surgery as it's been around 14 days since my surgery now? Sofianhleihil: It is normal for it to take about 2-3 weeks to close and \"engulf\" the clot, you will only see the new gingiva formed above, the clot will exist underneath the new tissue. The clot will (slowly) turn into bone, that will offer structural resistance in that area.Healing time differs from patient to patient, it depends on the extent of the trauma to the bone and surrounding tissues.Did the sweeling start to go away? Tazmine: I was taking Cocodamol for a few days last week but since the stitches have come out there is no pain or swelling anywhere in my mouth. Is this normal healing for the tooth extraction then with the bump in the socket? Thank you!!

    "dialogue": "dentaldummy: So it was my first year out of dental school.... I worked in this crazy factory of a medicaid practice.  My bosses basically bullied me on a regular basis (dentists that work alongside in the same office) to go faster and produce more.  They even went so far as to tell the assistants they weren't allowed to give me 330s, and that I had to use a 557 for everything (no matter how small, even for pedo).  The assistants were also tasked with timing me and reporting if I took too much time.  Anyways, 10 months into this...It's 5 o'clock and I still have a patient waiting...I feel I messed up because I was rushing constantly....anyways....We had done a pulp crown on A on this 6 year old and he did fine-ish, but his patience was out and we still had to extract an exfoliating Q.  Well he kinda freaks out when he sees the forceps and all I can think is \"just get that tooth out quick\" So I grip the tooth and in one flick of my wrist I rotated R straight out like butter.  Immediately I feel like dying, it's the wrong freaking tooth.  I'm not normally the one in charge of emergencies so I'm panicking and my memory and fight/flight response fail me miserably and all I can think is \"dont wash the PDL, replace quickly, stint, and follow-up\".  So I do this and think ok maybe it'll be ok maybe it'll be ok.  So my boss has arrived by this time (you can imagine the shit storm I got after that) and he informs me that was the wrong protocal for primary teeth, but we will go with it.  I immediately go and tell the parents personally what I have done and request they come back in 3 weeks.  We never hear from them again.  Fast forward 3 months, I  recently received a complaint the mother has filed with the board.  I'm not surprised, I totally deserve whatever is coming for me.  However,  this has seriously been ruining my daily life.  Waiting for the discipline action and unknowing what to expect has been total torture.    I think about this every day, all the time.  Not just out of fear for myself and my future, but also with the guilt for what I did to that little boy.  I am just beside myself with guilt. I am not a negligent dentist!!    I take my time and truly treat every single treatment on every single patient like I would want someone to treat my child or my mother or my sibling....I freaking care more than any other dentist I know (no offense...I dont know you  ) hence why I was constantly in trouble for taking too long lol I'm extremely paranoid about making a mistake and boom...I make this huge one in one split second.....I am so disappointed in myself.  I don't know how I allowed that to happen....I feel like such a failure and a terrible dentist and like I should have gone into a different career field.  How did I let this happen?!?!Bottom line questions:Does anyone have any similar experience or peronsally know of someone that has messed up on this epic of levels?\nWhat's the process with the board at this point? How long until I finally know my fate?\nShould I get a lawyer? What are the chances this will go to court? (I have tail insurance coverage)\nI have since left that miserable place and have found a wonderful job.  When do I need to inform them of this investigation and action? After I'm \"convicted and sentenced\" or now that I know about the complaint? Can I get fired over this? I am so mortified and embarrassed to admit it to anyone, much less my fairly new employer that has been nothing but wonderful to me for the last 2 months. calcium48: really sorry to hear that.\nMistakes happen, that's just the way it is. The kid didn't help. I wouldn't go back to work at that place any way.Personally, I think you will make a great dentist.

I got told to not change the bite. But im now wondering if this is correct to just leave it like this. I already received the trying with the wax rims, sent it back to the lab. \n-should i leave it howit is¿ \nSo the patient wont have a good bite on the right side...\n(The bone of the maxilla is much narriwer than the mandoble)\nThank you!"

    "dialogue": "Oranges: Hi, I'm new to the forum - apologies for the length.I have just started seeing a new dentist due to a move. He did x-rays and told me that I needed to re-do one of my fillings (I felt no pain), have a new filling, replace a filling that came out (I agree) and have another filling in a spot where the filling kept coming out (my old dentist told me to leave it and keep it clean).  I was not feeling any pain in any of the teeth and felt sick that I needed so much work.  I now find it odd that there were no actual cavities, just decay thathas prompted the work.  Also odd was his rush to do everything.I went back to see him to get the the work started - I thought he'd start with the broken filling.  He replaced this with a temporary filling and said he wanted to keep an eye on the nerve to see if it would eventually need a root canal (I don't understand this).  The same appointment, he replaced the filling on my other tooth and made the new filling in the third tooth (both were deep).  I now feel extensive sensitivity and wonder if he is was just doing unnecessary work for profit?-Does decay need a filling? Could he have just kept an eye on this - and were there any other options?\n-Do old but otherwise fine fillings need to be replaced?\n-Why do a temporary filling - doesn't it risk breaking down and prompting root canal?\nI'm getting copies of my x-rays soon - there is just something in my gut telling me he doesn't have my best interests at heart.  I've had a few dentists in my life and this is the first time I have ever felt this way.\nCan anyone advise?Many thanks in advance."

This was fine in the stone age when we were all living in mud huts and there were no dentists, since by the age of 40 we would probably all of died of other causes anyway. Perhaps by now, since we are living so much longer, evolution should have adapted our teeth to be much stronger and longer lasting. Imagine if we had teeth like a Rabbit that constantly keep growing and just need to be filed down once a year. If a tooth should break, then no problem it just grows back again!Of course this is just food for thought, I have no immediate practical answers to this problem"

    "dialogue": "jerzeygirl70: I have a mouth guard made from my dentist office for Bruxism. I hate wearing it not because it's uncomfortable exactly because it was formed to fit my teeth. However it suctions to me teeth and I'm worried it will make my teeth become soft or loose or decay. The part that sits in the roof of my mouth was ground back by my dentist because that part annoys me and I have to take it out within an hour or so but that part still bothers me. I've read that the mouth guard can cause tooth decay and that's a real fear for me. Is there a way to prevent this? Also, I think it would be so much easier for me to wear if the mouth guard was a two or three cap type that pops on over my top or bottom back teeth. Is there such a thing in existence that the dentist can also custom make? I believe that piece that sits in the roof of my mouth is just too annoying. I have to make a dental appt because I haven't been wearing my guard because of all the references I've made above so now I have ground my filling out of one of my bottom teeth. Any factual help would be greatly appreciated. Fesenko Nikas: The problem of Bruxism is, first of all, problems with your nerves or circulation of the blood. So, you are to visit a doctor neurologist, to be prescribed medicine for improving the blood supply to the brain and some sedatives. After a course of these medicines, you have to feel the relief of the symptoms of Bruxism."

    "title": "Two Small Cavities Became Two Root Canals",
    "dialogue": "Dental Patient Number 1: During my bi-annual exam the dentist didn't even notice my cavities until I asked about a small sharp place between 18 and 19 that tended to collect food.  He said he could fill them \"they were small\" and \"not an emergency\" so I got an appointment several weeks later.  No pain in the teeth whatsoever, just the chip or sharp spot that snagged food.  I get the cavities filled.  On the way out of the door, the dentist says, \"that back one, if you have any problems with it, you'll need to see an endodontist, it was deep\".  I was very sore after the two fillings and within 2-3 days realized there was a problem.  Pain getting worse and worse to the point it was constant and had a deep hurt that was so bad I couldn't tell exactly where it was coming from.  I made an appointment with an endodontist to likely get a root canal.  The specialist test both 19 and 20 and did xrays and he pointed out that on 19, the previous dentist had drilled really close to the pulp which was likely cause of my pain.  But, he had a twist, he said, \"it could also be 20, it is close to the pulp, too\".  So, essentially, I needed two root canals.  I was in so much pain that I said, \"fine, do it\".  I am speculating that my normal dentist drilled too deeply into these cavities and ended up making me need root canals.  If they had been deep cavities and described as such on xrays prior, maybe I wouldn't think this.  But, i had no pain before the first dental visit as he filled the cavities.  But, shortly after - less than a week later, I'm sitting in the chair getting two root canals.  This has wiped out my dental benefits for the year and has me over $1000 out of pocket.  Oh, and now I assume I will need two crowns, too.  With no dental benefits left for this year - how much is this likely to cost me?I like my dentist - nice guy.  But, I think he is at fault here by overzealous drilling.  I don't want to see a malpractice attorney and go that route.  More of a rhetorical question than anything else... But what is the likelihood of him realizing he may have created this situation and offer to \"make it right?\"For you dentists, I realize you cant see the xrays and are limited in what you can say.  But how often does overzealous drilling happen and lead to root canals that might not have been necessary?Thanks in advance."

    "dialogue": "rubmail96: Unedited: https://ibb.co/cn1f0v\nEdited: https://ibb.co/giLJnaI visited my dentist last week simply for a check up because I have not been to the dentist in some time. I don't have any particular pain in my teeth that is worrying other than the slight soreness in some teeth that I get very rarely and only lasts for a short time.On inspecting my teeth, he said they look healthy and then he took two bitewing x-rays which I took pictures of with my phone, which is not perfect image quality but is an accurate representation of the x-ray. I have uploaded the left x-ray both unedited and the edited version to help explain what he said below.The right side he claims is fine.On the left bitewing x-ray, he says \"something is about to cause a lot of pain\". I have uploaded the image of the left bitewing x-ray. He says that the tooth circled in red on the image is abnormal and claims that the disease process has gone through the enamel of the tooth where there is a dark spot (red arrow) and to defend/compensate against this process, more dentine has been deposited on the top right section of the image of that tooth (within red triangle) and that is why it is a different density and why you can't see part of the pulp on that side.He also says that I should not leave the decision as to whether to get a filling or not for any longer than a month otherwise it will proceed and get worse and claims that if I leave it for 3 months, it's likely I'll need a root canal procedure done on the tooth. I was taken back by this because I have absolutely no pain in that tooth and it is not causing me trouble. This dentist is very recently graduated and was scaring me so I asked my mum, who happens to have been a dentist for 20 years before she retired. She says that there is nothing particularly concerning about that tooth and a filling is unnecessary. She assures me that the caries process in my teeth are \"arrested\" and says that if the tooth was in as bad a condition as he claims, I would be in severe pain.So now I am stuck between the opinion of two dentists, one of whom is young and inexperienced. If he turns out to be right, it will progress and I may need a root canal procedure done. If she turns out to be right, I will have had an unnecessary filling which I obviously don't want.I thought some dentists could give me their advice as to what is going on and what the best course of action would be. calcium48: gum disease is painless."

Dusan Cirkovic: many things you have covered with this statment but you must be aware that fitting the bridge is one thing and maintain adequate oral health is other. Duration of bridges depends on multiple factors. but I would say that adequate tooth preparation, good restoration either PFM od full ceramics and good oral hygiene are prerogatives for longevity of that bridge. Joe-dental: Would the cement resin used to attach the bridge to the pontics more likely to deteriorate and lead to an entrance of bacteria in a porcelain or a PFM bridge, or neither, as the cement does not deteriorate?

So pretty much for a while now I've gotten a lot of canker sores in my mouth and they hurt for a while and last a good amount of time sometimes like 1-4 weeks generally. But right now I have what I'm not sure is a canker sore or signs of a wisdom teeth or what but its pretty much what looks like a maybe 1cm cut on my gum near my middle molar that is white and hurts very badly whenever I get foods in or near it. I was originally thinking this could be caused by me chewing on things down in that general area for example a plastic lid and it slipping and cutting me because I seem to do that a lot and it just got infected or something and turned into a canker but I'm unsure of what this is or if it's anything to worry about. It's been here for approximately 5-7 days now so if it is a canker my general luck it will still be here a while but generally my cankers are more rounds not a straight line cut sort of thing.

It was about 24hrs after the fillings i started experience this sinus pain and what i assume is referred dental painI have TMJ so my opening is slightly limited also. I took an OTC sinus product last night so should i continue with this? I have a further dental appointment Monday (4 days time) so will have it checked then but just wondering in the mean time what to do or would an antibiotic be beneficial?Thanks"

Your wife should go back to the dental office and have them look at it.\nDr. Barniv jonsubs: Thank you for your opinions. We did get an appointment and the doctor suggested this was the result of an ulcer, and no infection.

The denture fills gaps on either side of my upper teeth, just behind my canines and has a thin metal bar across the roof of my mouth.When I put it in it seems to be quite comfortable, however the metal bar does not sit against the roof of my mouth meaning that the denture is wholly supported by the clips on my upper molars. There seems to be a 1 mm (at most) gap. I was expecting more support from the bar against my palette. Does anyone have any experience with this type of denture who could tell me if this is the way they are meant to fit.Regards David"

However didn't notice much improvement at all. Went back to the dentist the Tuesday and he reopened the tooth and recleaned it which was excruciating. Even with a lot of anaesthetic I could still feel horrible pain. He says it was quite infected still. Ended up back at the dentist the next day which was the Wednesday as was still in agony. The dentist I saw done the exact same thing and mentioned it was getting better. Then on the Thursday I was back and they changed my antibiotics to co amoxiclav 500/125mg 1 3 x a day for 7 days. It is now day 4 on the antibiotics and the tooth is sore again. It felt better yesterday and was managing with less pain relief but today it's quite sore again.

As you can see I am focusing on keeping the wisdom teeth very clean to avoid any further infections. Xiuying: From what I was just told about when I had my wisdom teeth looked at, The longer they are in, the worse the issues will become and if you are unlucky like myself. The wisdom tooth that is impacted, will cause damage to the teeth near it and have to be pulled :/.I would suggest going to see a oral surgeon about it. They are \"specialized\" in situations like that. Where your dentist might be reluctant to pull it. Most oral surgeons have the experience and are more than likely to pull it."

    "dialogue": "Mayan: I just came back from a regular check-in & cleaning at a new dentist. The hygienist took some \"regular check-in x-rays\" then took out a diagram that showed a regular gum & an infected gum. She scared me by saying \"this is what happens if you don't floss.\" I asked how these conditions are treated, and she said by \"deep cleaning.\" An alarm went off in my head because my previous dentist whom I've trusted 100% and had for years had warned me specifically to not get a \"deep cleaning.\" He said it was the new thing in California and a lot of dentist just want to do it, and I don't need one. (I can no longer see this dentist because I have moved). The new hygienist proceeded to measure my gum. The numbers she called out were mostly 2's and some 3's (millimeters, I assume). She said that that my gum was mostly fine. So I assumed she'll just do a regular cleaning. However, before she started, she said, \"raise your hand if it hurts and I'll stop.\" Regular cleaning in the past have never been painful for me. When she started, it actually hurt, and it felt like she was seriously scraping my teeth and poking my gum. It didn't feel like just regular cleaning. I'm pretty tolerant of pain, but I did raise my hand once or twice. Does this sound like deep cleaning? Is it possible for a hygienist to do this without getting my consent? Or am I just over-reacting and she was just not a very good hygienist? (for reference, I am in my 20s, no cavities, healthy). Grace Meyer: Do you floss? She's not scaring you, just educating you on the importance of it. If you don't floss everyday, and/or it had been a while since you have had a cleaning, you may have had more tartar build-up and inflammation than normal. This alone would require the hygienist to work harder than usual to clean your teeth, therefore be more uncomfortable to you. If she was reading off 2-3mm measurements, she likely only did a regular cleaning. Floss everyday and see your dentists twice per year and it probably won't hurt so bad at future visits."

She've had the bridge for 15 years. She thinks that the bridge crown on the tooth is coming loose. It makes sense as a bridge is basically 2 crowned teeth next to empty space.So, she made an appointment to a new primary care dentist. The dentist believes that it is not her bridge but the tooth's nerve due to the shifting (??). She then refers her to an Endodontist. She claims that the endodontist will perform a root canal on the tooth through the crown (i.e. bridge). My wife asked the dentist if she is having an infection on the tooth, but the dentist said 'no'.There are so many questions in our mind:Why would she need a root canal on a non-infected tooth.\nIsn't odd to perform a root canal where a dentist would drill through a crown (i.e. the bridge)?\nWould the procedure damage the bridge?\nHow would the endodontist seal the bridge to prevent future infections?\nPlease let me know if this is the new procedure to take care a crowned tooth.Thanks!"

    "title": "My adult teeth grew above and in front of my baby teeth",
    "dialogue": "Salubrius: Greetings!I have been extensively searching online for information on my lifelong dental problem and what happened that was the first sign that something was not right. I have not been very successful, so I thought that it might be of interest to dentists and if one has an idea how my continual problem can be helped then that's a bonus!As a child I had two sets of upper teeth. I know what you are thinking, but my adult teeth did not grow behind my baby teeth as is relatively common, they grew out the front of my gums. It was not just one or two such as the canines, it was all my front upper teeth. The first I noticed something felt strange  was indeed above the canines, but then as the teeth broke through there the same was happening above my two front teeth. It was a very rapid process and none of the baby teeth were even vaguely loose. The dentist decided that at least eight baby teeth would have to be removed. I can't remember exactly how many she ended up removing, it was in the days of gas and air knocking you out on the dentist's chair, but I do remember my teeth the day of the appointment, I quite liked my scary two rows of teeth! Then of course there was the horrible braces plate thing. I don't remember how my teeth looked straight after the removal of the baby teeth, but my parents say I had a gap between my front two teeth the size of a tooth. The strange thing is, their memories aren't great, but they seem to think that gap was always there inbetween my baby teeth. I always smiled with my mouth closed, so old pictures don't help. Which in itself leads me to think maybe they are right, why would I never smile showing my teeth unless there had always been something that didn't look right? Anyway, my adult teeth ended up being very strange. My front two teeth were the worst. The angles of them were such that when I bit into an apple, they made the shape \\/. Not quite those angles, but not far off. The rest were nowhere near normal either.Every time I brushed my teeth my gums would bleed from inbetween my teeth. This is where we get to the lifelong problem. When I say the gum inbetween my teeth, I mean literally. My teeth are squashed so tightly to each other, I have never been able to floss. They really press on each other. However, at the very top where they meet the gums, there is a small gap between them. That's where my gums always bled when brushing. These gaps between them at the gums, combined with overlapping due to their angles and the tightness to each other, have led to constant tooth decay. My teeth don't get normal cavities. They decay from the sides. One tooth that has been removed revealed something very interesting. The side of the tooth next to it had no enamel and you could see where the other tooth had been inside it. So the tooth next to it had decayed from the gap at the gum between it and it's neighbour, but lower down it was so tightly squashed into the same neighbouring tooth, that it was inside it. I spent so much of my life with toothache and abscess, until two years ago I was having one tooth pulled a year. The nhs dentists would only pull a tooth once it was deemed beyond saving. Although they never said how my other teeth could actually be saved. So once a year a dentist would deem the worst tooth could be removed. It felt like my teeth were deliberately queueing up to make sure one of them was always causing me pain! After many years of this, I was finally able to afford to see a private dentist. I was hoping that as she was not nhs, she would do as I asked and take the lot out. She wouldn't, however she did agree to take several out that were decaying anyway and I got a partial plate, which I love. First time in my life I've ever smiled showing my teeth.Since then I've only had one more tooth extracted, which for 2 years is amazing for me. But I know that it's only temporary, the rest will all decay the same way sooner or later. I can tell which will be next to be removed.So, there it is. My story and my problem. Dentists refuse to remove healthy teeth, regardless of the pain they are going to cause me when they inevitably crumble on the side due to either the gap at the gumline or lower down the side due to the pressure of it's neighbouring tooth."

I have said that I wasn't having any trouble with my teeth until I went in for a cleaning in November of last year.  I had a cleaning and a fluoride treatment and my teeth have killed me since.  I can run my fingernail across them and it kills me.  The four dentist, one gp and one ent said that a fluoride treatment wouldn't have anything to do with  that.\nI found a forum on the net of different dentist, doctors and just people that take questions.  I emailed one of the doctors and told him about my problems and the fluoride treatment.  He did say he has never had a patient that had these kind of problems but said it could be possible.  He said \" It is not a common result for fluoride, but fluoride can cause irritations in some patients.If you sustained multiple irritations of your teeth, the gums tissue surrounding the teeth and the ligaments holding the tooh the the bone, and alteration of your bite is possible.  I have not personally had a patient who sustained these results , but it is possible.  That is the only possible cause I can think of.\"    I forgot to say that my bite has changed also.   Teeth hitting that never hit before.\nI have read that when you have a fluoride treatment it does penetrate your gums.  I also read there are two types of fluoride.  One for someone whose has crowns, receding gums and one for someone that has normal teeth.  I have no idea if my treatment was done with the right fluoride, the right amount of fluoride, and the right amount of time the fluoride was in my mouth.  This was the first one I ever had done.  I am 70 and I do have crowns and my gums are receded some.  I still say the treatment has did something to my gums and teeth.  I will say this, if I was older and have receded gums, crowns I would look seriously at having a fluoride treatment."

After I got home I called back and they told me it was because of my insurance that I had to wait 4 weeks. So I called my insurance and they told me that I DONT have to wait that you cant just bill for polishing and it had to be a cleaning which included the polishing.

Been having this problem since November of last year after a dentist visit for a cleaning and a fluoride treatment.  No dental work was done.  I  was not having trouble with my teeth before the dentist visit.  \nWhen I close my mouth and my teeth touch it really hurts.  I also started having problems with teeth hitting hard.  Had some of them ground on to get some relief.  I know they say don't have them ground on but I had to have something done.  The dentist says he can't see anything wrong with my teeth.  # 30 needs to have the root canal redone but the rest of my teeth look  ok.  He has taken xrays.  I think the one that hurts the worst has a crown and root canal and he says it looks good.  It seems like my bite off or something and my mouth posture just doesn't feel right.  I am wondering if maybe the last dentist visit I held my jaw wrong or something and gotten my bite off is why my teeth started hitting. \nAnybody got any idea why my teeth could hurt if there is nothing wrong with them.  I think I am going to to go a neurologist and see if he can tell me anything.  I have to a ent and my regular doctor with no answers at all.  Any suggestions.   Thanks"

I tried to buy insurance and all of them have 6 to 12 months waiting period and they only cover 50% of major problems such as root canal. So buying dental insurance is useless for me!I do not know what to do. Do you think I can wait for 12 months or it will start hurting soon! I attached the photo! svor1988: $2000 is pricey for a root canal, I think around $600-1200 is more reasonable. Call/email more dentists/endodontists and get quotes. Make sure you get quotes for both the root canal surgery & crown. Ask if they give cash discounts, senior discounts, or what have you. I don't care for insurance personally.Perhaps a root canal isn't necessary yet... I don't know. Get more opinions when showing them that xray... email them if they have a website.Steer clear of acidic/sugary foods/drinks meanwhile, and brush/rinse after eating.

    "dialogue": "bostonguy2212: I'm in Ireland for my honeymoon (having a blast!) but a little concerned about a gum abscess related to a failing root canal that doesn't seem to be reacting to 500mg of amoxicillin 4 times a day...I was diagnosed with a failing root canal by my endodontist last Tuesday, 3/7. This was after seeing my regular dentist a week earlier who put me on a 7 day prescription of amoxicillin that seemed to help with the inflammation and immense pain. It came roaring back before my endodontist appointment (with no pain but more swelling this time). Considering the proximity to my wedding day on that Saturday, 3/11 and subsequent trip to Ireland on Sunday (and with the area too inflamed for immediate action) the endodontist put me on a giant prescription of amoxicillin and scheduled me for a root canal re-treatment 2 weeks from today on March 28th (when I'm back in Boston).Luckily, I'm in very little pain with this round of the infection. However, the pimple-like sore above my top right molar has only gotten bigger since beginning the latest antibiotic regimen. And this is with swirling hot salt water around my mouth 3 times a day and taking lots of ibuprofen. Of course I've been reading horror stories online about infections fatally spreading to other parts of the body and I'm quite concerned at this point. I'm worried that putting this surgery off for so long could end up being really dangerous--and even more-so since the antibiotics don't seem to be helping. I'm 27 years old and in pretty good health, which means a spreading infection should be pretty rare? Am I over-thinking this or should I be rushing to the nearest clinic in Ireland to do something about it? Thanks in advance!!! svor1988: > However, the pimple-like sore above my top right molar has only gotten bigger since beginning the latest antibiotic regimen.I have no idea why dental professionals choose so often to treat said issues with oral antibiotics instead of directly injecting antibiotics to the *local* infection. Said oral antibiotics may do permanent damage to your digestive system's flora, which aside from helping digest a wide variety of foods it does things like synthesize a large fraction of your body's serotonin and b12... Anyways, I'm digressing sorry.Oral antibiotics are only able to go where capillary flow allows. Should the entire pulp of the tooth be so infected that capillary flow does not exist within, antibiotics wouldn't get in either. Or possibly the infection is either immune (e.g. viral) or just inhibited somewhat by said antibiotics.Keep doing the salt water as needed. Don't OD on ibuprofen... shouldn't take it longer than a week due to the risk of stomach ulcers IIRC. A large dose of niacin (vitamin B3) has an anti-inflammatory effect without said side effect. Though I'm not sure if you need either... I had a blister on the outer side of my molar (on the gum) for 6+ years that filled with pus. It would drain into my mouth if I pressed on it. It never spread. Eventually an extraction was done (an the molar was deformed), and that infection was scraped off of the bone.\n> Of course I've been reading horror stories online about infections fatally spreading to other parts of the body and I'm quite concerned at this point. Yes infection can spread to other parts of the body. In my case, thanks to a dental titanium implant, it swelled up my pallet, uvula and inner cheek first. After that, my outer check, face, upper face, and even swelled my left eye shut and put immense pressure on my eye from below. I lost a lot of tissue to necrosis in my palate and by the implant due to that. Thankfully the infection was brought under control at that point. Be aware of the symptoms of a blood infection, as that can kill within days.\n> Am I over-thinking thisFrom your description I'd say so. Try to enjoy your honeymoon with your spouse! Sounds like you're in good hands with your endodontist."

I'd been there dozens of times and only that time the TV was on. Guess what, they had to redo the mold 4x because I kept laughing. Cha-chang! Insurance company wouldn't know any better.\n> At the moment he's still my dentist and actually very highly ratedRatings online (other than yelp) are garbage. Businesses remove negative reviews from google. I've seen sex offender, fraudulent, and other medical professionals with criminal history all with 4.8+ ratings that pop up on a google search (e.g. healthgrades.com ratings)... seems like BS to me.\n> but I don't think I want him back in my mouth.Follow your gut feeling... your ancestors survived well enough with it... best of luck to you.\n> Is this malpractice?I don't know. Consider consulting with a 2nd dentist for $25, and voicing your concerns with the placing dentist's secretary. If you really did observe wrong doing, then file a complaint with your state's medical board, leave an non-libelous review on yelp, and move on to someone else. A court case may very time consuming and difficult.Now, lets try to make the best of your present situation:\nBy saying the enamel was removed, makes me believe a large area of dentin is visible below the crown and above the gumline, right? Try sampling toothpaste products for sensitive teeth- ones without SLS for example. Steer clear of mouthwashes until you learn which ones have a pH above 5.5 (the critical pH of cementum and dentin). Don't keep the mouthwash in your mouth longer than the directions say to.​"

Tooth was broken prior to her attempt.About a 2-3 weeks later it started bothering me and I decided it had gotten infected. They perscribed me 5 days of Amoxicillin and send me on my way. Shortly after finishing that course I could tell the infection hadn't clearled and went back, they then perscribed 5 days of Metronidazole instead and sent me off again.About 2 days into the course of the Metronidazole I caught a cold, and then a day later, started to come down with a fever. I figured that fever was caused by the Metronidazole at first since it was on the list of side effects and so was dizziness. I also had a skin rash at the end (not itchy or lumpy, only visable when I was too hot) as well as feeling sick, and loss of appetite, tooth infection felt like it had gone down (very small lump on the gum that is hard to make out if it's even a lump, not bulging or anything, only slightly, was just more pale than the rest of the gum)Now, about 10 days after I first got that fever, I still have it. I know this isn't normal. Does anyone have any ideas? Could the Metronidazole have caused a fever that lasts this long? If it was my tooth, could I come down with a fever while on the antibiotics? I'm waiting for a doctor's appointment right now, but I'm wondering if it's better that I go back to my dentist again, although I'm expecting them to just throw antibiotics at me again. Can I ask them to clean the tooth out that's pending extraction? Right now I feel like I'd rather wait on the doctor and be sure the fever isn't some reaction to the Metronidazole rather than end up with the dentist perscribing it to me again.\nReally hope someone can give some advice or point me in the right direction here."

(I've been out of work, uninsured, and broke, so unable to see a dentist.)  Had occasional pain and perhaps some mild swelling along the way, but nothing intense or long lasting. Stayed very vigilant about keeping it clean and the hollow/open portion cleaned out with a toothpick.  Tonight, the remaining 3/4 portion of the tooth (above the gumline) fell out. It looks like a baby molar, with no root. I *thought* wisdom teeth had roots, but I just can't see or feel anything left in the big open socket.  It's a little tender, so I don't want to poke TOO hard, though, so maybe there is something solid still in there.  I don't know!  (I'm 43, and no dentist has ever mentioned anything unusual about my wisdom teeth or roots, btw.)Okay, so questions are:\n1. Can I assume there *is* a root still in there?  Or could it have fully decayed or perhaps have never existed, etc.\n2. Big open socket. How do I care for it?  With the tooth, I brushed, flossed, and picked it regularly. The socket feels too tender for that (right now at least.)\n3. What complications might I need to be watchful for now?\n4.

With the tooth, I brushed, flossed, and picked it regularly. The socket feels too tender for that (right now at least.)Same as a wisdom tooth extraction- salt water rinses.I've seen another person speak of with infections caused by a leftover root fragment which the dentist neglected to remove... keep using salt water after meals. Don't suck on straws or anything. You want any heavy blood in that socket to stay there to maximize bone-regrowth.A very rare complication from tooth extraction is a blood infection... so if you get blood infection symptoms take care of that immediately as a blood infection can kill within a few days. Since it fell out on its own and there doesn't appear to be a pre-existing infection this shouldn't be a worry."

    "dialogue": "allhours: Late January of this year (last month), I was informed by the dentist that I had a cavity. I went two weeks later (after my cleaning) to have the filling fixed filling was near my gum-line. The dentist never x-rayed the cavity. After the novicane wore off, the filling was in pain. I figured, well, the cavity has to \"set\" or heal, so I figured in time it would settle down. 10 days later, it got worse. I called the dentist and over the phone, the dental assistant said, the never is dying, you are going to need a root -canal. I was pretty upset over this, and went to an endodontist to confirm this. He did a full mouth xray with some huge machine I stood in, and some standard xrays. Yep, you need a root canal said the endodontist. The endodontist gave me an appointment for a root canal and 1500 mg/day for 7 days of antibiotics and Vicaden pain killers. I also made a 1300.00 appontment for my root canal to be done later this month, (March).I called the dentist again and said, \"listen, when you did my cavity, you said all I had was a cavity, you said nothing of any possibility of a root canal, furthermore, why didn't you xray the tooth?\" I explained how mad I was over this situation, so he told me to come in. When I came in, I sat in the chair beside the dentist chair and told him, I feel you are responsible for this situation and I feel because you didn't tell me anything other than, \"You have a cavity\", didn't do any communicating, I feel you should absorb the cost. The dentist went off on me like a maniac, saying \"I don't want you in my office anymore, I am discharging you as a patient\"\nI said, Listen, I am the one who has been in dreadful pain for the past three weeks, I am the one who has to deal with the expense, I am the one who was told NOTHING after your work. His defense for not doing the xray was first, \"your insurance doesn't cover it, then when I said, I would have PAID for it, he replied, I didn't feel an xray was in order or necessary.\"When I glanced at the xray from the Endodonist, it looked as if he drilled right to the pulp area. I personally feel he acted negligently.  Any comments? I feel I should be able to sue him. Around 20 year ago, when I needed a root canal on another tooth, the dentist I used at that time, was talking about it in full detail before he even worked on the tooth in question. Any input would be helpful here. John Roberts: Sorry about your pain and trouble.  If you don't have dentist  insurance like me it puts you in a bind.  You probably need to ask around about dentist in your area and go get a second opinion.  Sounds like to me he knows he screwed up and want to get rid of you.  Hope you get everything fixed. svor1988: I'm sorry I don't know enough in that area to comment on that. I do understand that dentists can visually see as they drill when they had hit dentin, and when they see/hit pulp. I'm curious why a topical antibiotic would not be applied if they had hit pulp. An interesting side note is that recently researchers at the King's College London had found that the Alzheimer's drug Tideglusib causes dentin to be recreated in bulk (previously only a thin layer of dentin would be recreated naturally). It doesn't restore enamel, but it is a super neat discovery, and I hope it reaches dental practices everywhere soon. Read a news article about it. An excerpt:\n\"Professor Paul Sharpe, lead author of the study, of the Dental Institute, from King’s College London, said: 'The simplicity of our approach makes it ideal as a clinical dental product for the natural treatment of large cavities, by providing both pulp protection and restoring dentine.' \"​\nMakes me think about policemen & accountability regarding body-cams, but along the lines of a mix between google-glasses and dental loupes. That way their high-dollar work is able to be appraised by other experts & the patient. Nice business idea if you can lobby your government to make products like that mandatory while you sell those products to dental practitioners at the same time.John Roberts I remember you had problems like I do with dry mouth (in my case caused by dental work, medication, & CT scan radiation). I did find a new way to increase salivation- read the examine.com article on trimethylglycine as it pertains to treating 'dry mouth' and 'salivation'. trimethylglycine powder is cheap and it is a natural part of the body's one-carbon metabolism. I'm going to find a reliable source and see if it works for me."

    "title": "Extraction of Baby Molar Teeth",
    "dialogue": "fengkuoyu: My 5 year old nephew recently had a check up on his teeth and was told that he has cavities on 8 of his baby teeth.  The worst ones are on 3 of his molar teeth.  We were told that the cavities in those teeth are so big that the teeth may break into pieces if they get filled and so we were given the option to have them extracted... and to fill the rest of the cavities on other teeth.  The dentist then recommended putting spacers where the molars are extracted.  Our worries are the following.  My nephew has never complained of having any toothache, why are his cavities that bad and big but he's not feeling any pain?  Do you think the cavities are really that big if there is no pain?  My nephew is sooooo young.  I think he won't have permanent molars until he gets to around 10 years old?  What are the long and short term consequences if the baby molars get extracted that early?  I am worried that if he doesn't do a good job on brushing his teeth, then the teeth next to the spacers will get cavities too.  We saw a general dentist when we went for the check up and an x-ray is yet to be taken, but the dentist could already see big cavities just by inspection.  (However we as parents and family members only saw 1mm diameter holes on the surface of his teeth).  Is extraction of 3 baby molar teeth (one in each quadrant) with spacers put in a bit too extreme for a 5 year old child?  The spacers must be awfully uncomfortable.  Shall we consider root canal treatment with crowns instead on the molars for the betterment of his oral health?  Should we see a paedodontist instead?  What do you think is the best option for a 5 year old child if what the dentist said are all true after the x-rays have been taken?  We are all worried and unsure of what we should decide.  Please help!\""

    "dialogue": "John Roberts: I have made several posts the last few months about my teeth hurting.  Been to three different dentist.  This is what I have. When I am laying in bed in the morning I can put my teeth together and I would say on a pain scale it is about a 1 or 2 as they all contact.  I can feel a little discomfort in my lower front teeth a little but not too bad.  My jaw teeth on both sides feel fairly well.  The problem I a having is that as the day goes on I start getting pain in both sides of my lower jaw teeth on both sides when they come together.  By the end of the day a can't put my teeth together for the pain in these jaw teeth.  Sometime the tops will bother me but it has been the lowers mostly.  \nAll my teeth have become extremely sensitive to the touch.  Even my good teeth that there is nothing wrong with( 12 I think).  The dentist has no answers as to what is wrong with my teeth.  I don't think I grind my teeth but since I can't get any answers I am having a night guard made to see if that may help.  I just can't figure out why my jaw teeth will feel pretty good then start hurting.  Does anyone have any ideas.\n                                                       I have since learned that when a baffling or painful experience comes,\n                                                       the crucial thing is not always to find the right answers,\n                                                       but to ask the right questions......\n                                                      Often it is simply the right question at the right time\n                                                      that propels us on into the journey of awakening.This is what I am hoping on my teeth.

On my bottom right back teeth, currently have a wisdom trying to come up but hasn't cut my skin yet, could see this on the x-ray, for about 2 months I have had a bad taste when I run my tongue over that bit of gum... this to me says infection but my dentist does not seem worried? Should I be? Maybe switch dentist or and get another opinion? Please help me   Surely them\nBeing professionals shouldn't send me away knowing something needs doing! allhours: I had my wisdom teeth removed by an oral surgeon almost 20 years ago. IT IS PAINFUL, no doubt about it. I had several shots of novacane and was awake to hear the dreadful cruches and each time pain would creep up as the assistant and surgeon went deeper, they'd hit me with more novacne, total of like 5 to 7 shots on each tooth they took out. I'm not trying to scare you, this was 20 years ago, I had only state medicaid insurance and they would only remove one tooth at a time. Thank god I had a really cool and experienced Jamaican oral surgeon who was able to talk me through the procedure. \"You're doing fine!\" CRUNCH, CRUNCH! She was a tough cookie and broke that tooth right out from my jaw! \nAgain, I'm not trying to scare you, I guess what I'm trying to say is, get it taken out ASAP, it is doing you no good!  Oh, the pain for the next 7-10 days was only remedied by Tylenol with Codine #3. If I am scaring you, I am sorry, it was just the experience I went through, and I am glad I did it because Lord knows, those wisdom teeth were NOTHING BUT TROUBLE!"

The tooth has NOT been able to be NUMBED SUFFICIENTLY in the past, so root canals have been incomplete. The DDS at a popular chain (Gentle Dental) I saw today for an eval, did not offer the option of extraction, but instead recommended work, by another ENDODONTIST, on that tooth AND 2 other adjacents (root canals, crowns)= even with insurance VERY EXPENSIVE (my cost $4000+). I KNOW that DDS's SAY they want to be \"conservative\", and not extract, so they try to preserve what's there. But, I am in pain NOW, and I don't feel that my concern (THE IMMEDIATE PAIN), was addressed. I also feel that dentists run BUSINESSES, and like everyone else, try to maximize profits. WE EVEN DISAGREED SHARPLY ON WHICH TOOTH IS CAUSING THE PAIN !!!  On the other hand, there is a small office in a nearby town, whose DDS is \"proud of his anesthesia techniques\", and charges $189 for a \"complex\" extraction. I've NEVER regretted losing teeth, or having them pulled.  Help ?  Advice ? Thank you very much. John Roberts: Sorry about your problem.  I am 70 and have problems with all my teeth hurting.  Been having problems since 11/18/16.  I have several posts on here under John Roberts talking about it.  I have been to a DDS, a Orthodontist and he sent me to a Endodonist.  Went to him yesterday.  One of my molars # 30 has a crown and a root canal.  The crown has been on there a long time and the root canal was done in 08.  The back tooth next to it was supposed to have a root canal but I don't think it did.  Anyway the Endodonist wants to redo the root canal because he says it is causing me pain when it and the top tooth contact.  I also have pain with other teeth touching but this is the worst. After he did his xrays the tooth only has half a root canal to start with which really pisses me off and I think it is messed up. The dentist didn't do but one canal so the Endodonist called it a half a root canal.  I also found out from the xray that there wasn't a root canal did on the #31 tooth which I was charged for.  He has retired.  I went back to his office and told them about it.  I hope to get my money back for that.\nDon't have insurance and it will cost  me 1,300.00 out of pocket to get the root canal redone.  I don't know what is going to happen with the rest of my teeth.  They are hurting and they can't tell me why.  I am thinking about having it pulled.  I have read and read about not having teeth pulled.  I am like you on the conservative part but they are not paying for it and in my opinion they charge way too much anyway.  I know dentist wont agree but that's just my opinion.  If you want it removed I would fine somebody you feel good about and do what you want to.  JMO svor1988: crumbling toofs said:\t\t\twith insurance VERY EXPENSIVE (my cost $4000+).\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Yes that is ludicrous from my understanding... you should be facing $300-600 with insurance for root canal treatment on a molar. Treat this just like searching for a mechanic with a reasonable rate.Be aware that medical professionals do treat each other with referral incentives.Call a bunch of endodontists in your area and get quotes for your #30 molar. See both what your cash rate would be with discount they may offer for cash, and also what rate for using your insurance... svor1988: Also I'd encourage you to use the ancient practice of haggling... you'll find prices everywhere are really quite arbitrary."

If I do just have to get the filling should I go for the silver one or a composite filling?(silver free, composite £100). \nThanks in advance. Kathryn132: If it's at the back just get the amalgam if it's less expensive.  Don't worry about the filling you won't feel anything- I've had lots over the years svor1988: Search and read about \"dentist philosophy decay\" and \"Minimal intervention dentistry\". Ask any prospective dentist what their philosophy is, either a \"wait and see\" (to see if your personal oral care will result in remineralization) or preventative. From my reading and understanding if the decay had reached the dentin then it is best to treat as the caries spreads much quicker at that point, but if the caries is only in the enamel then it may be best to see if remineralization will resolve the issue.Saliva remineralizes the teeth. So would things high in calcium & phosphate (e.g. bovine milk with any % fat but vitamin D fortified is better). Stay away from acidic things like many mouthwashes, coffee, and OJ. Brush your teeth with fluoride product in the morning to ensure fluoride is available during day to counter any acidic damage. Brush & rinse within 4 hours of eating to remove sugar/carbs.If you're familiar with the pH scale (I think this is mandatory in U.S. high school science at least), look up what the acidity of drinks & lactic acid are, as well as the critical pH of your enamel/dentin/cementum and how fluoride lowers that critical pH."

I've been searching around for answers, but decided it's best to ask for my own situation.\nI'm almost 17 years old, and I've been having some trouble lately.\nAbout three weeks ago, I went to the dentist for wisdom teeth pain on my right side. They did x-rays, and said I needed to get all 4 out. They made me an appointment for July, but I called and got put on the cancellation list to see if I could get in earlier. So they were able to get me in a week after that.\nIt's been two weeks and one day since I had my surgery to remove them. Last Wednesday, one week ago today, I started having some pain in my top right teeth because they were shifting (I was unable to wear my retainer due to the blood clots)\nThursday night I only slept 30 minutes due to pain, I was sobbing and screaming from pain. Friday, I went to my dentist and they x-rayed my tooth and told me I had an abscessed tooth, and I'd need a root canal (scheduled for March)  because It's a front tooth. I got antibiotics and ibuprofen for pain. On Saturday, I was almost unable to eat from pain. Saturday night, I felt a huge burst of pain, and my mom told me I started clawing at my face, screaming. This was hands down the worst pain I've ever felt (Over appendicitis). My mom called my dentist and they said the \"pop\" was the infection breaking up.\nSince then, the pain has been down to a minimal, but my teeth have been really sensitive. If my top and bottom teeth hit, it starts hurting, and the sensitivity is unbearable.\nI also got a sore throat and a few small white blisters on my right tonsil (the same side of my infected tooth)\nI guess I'm just trying to ask if this is normal to be so sensitive? (The teeth around it are sensitive too)\nIs there anything I can do for pain? And could my sore throat be related?

Gargle with warm salt water 1-2x a day or as needed for pain. Antibiotics only works on a subset of bacterial infections, it never works for viral infections. Further, antibiotics don't penetrate certain areas well. Use salt water.Complete your antibiotics prescription, do not skip doses or stop early.Sorry your wisdom teeth were taken out. Hopefully it really was medically necessary on all four of them...Consider going to an endodontist for the root canal- higher rate of success and it's always good to get a second quote (expect ~$25 for the consultation)."

About 2 or so months later I had terrible pain on the side where my bridge is. The pain lasted a few days and the dentist gave me antibiotics. The pain went away, I finished my antibiotics but I got an abscess on my gum which produces puss when I push it [sometimes blood]. The dentist said it is not a fistula but a sinus infection and that the pain would come back even if it doesn’t hurt now. 12 is infected.In total he gave me 3 options;Option 1- He said the following; he recommends root canal treatment to save the tooth. Replace bridge in the future or cut bridge and replace in future. But, RCT won’t be straightforward due to the bridge blocking the view and can’t guarantee it will be successful. With the abscess present, RCT is less likely to be successful.Option 2- extract tooth with abscess and denture to be fitted immediately, cutting the bridge.Option 3- like 2 but cut the denture, remove the two teeth [12, 13] so there is less burden 14\nI will ask you some questions which might sound very dumb, so bear with me…!-I’m guessing that the X-ray showed the infection hence his recommendation for RCT?-Is it  true that the abscess/infection will not go away? I am in no pain.-why can’t he take the bridge off and then do RCT so he has no obstructions…and then put the bridge back?-the dentist mentioned an endodontist for this type of RC through a bridge, but I am an NHS patient and I doubt treatment by endodontists are on the NHS-I would prefer to avoid extraction for many reasons. Dentures sound silly as I am 33. I looked at implants online and think mini dental implants are a safer option?- I am aware that the infection might not be resolved with RCT, so if I extracted, have I sorted the infection out completely?  I understand you can still get an infection even after an implant!Sorry for all the questions but I am very confused and just need some advice please! Thanks a lot.Lastly….Before I make my decision, I am having 2 fillings on my other side and deep gum cleaning as my gums are inflamed.I can upload a photo of the abscess if it helps? svor1988: Tesla said:\t\t\tHi.The dentist said it is not a fistula but a sinus infection and that the pain would come back even if it doesn’t hurt now. 12 is infected.-Is it  true that the abscess/infection will not go away? I am in no pain.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nRead about the maxillary sinus. Look at how the teeth roots can sometimes perforate that sinus. Since the dentist said it is a sinus infection I expect the xray will show 12 perforating the maxillary sinus. In my experience you don't need antibiotics to treat that infection... irrigating the sinus with salt water 1-2x daily will do. Search for \"saline sinus rinse wikihow\" for instructions; all you need is salt, tap water, and a cup/bowl, you don't need to buy anything. Read all about your sinus anatomy so you know how to tilt your head around in order to irrigate the maxillary sinus (e.g. Google Image search for \"maxillary sinus teeth\" and \"maxillary sinus ostia\"). Don't use too much salt, it can sting. If it stings rinse with just water (no salt) after doing the salt water. You should feel it when the salt water hits the infected area!Antibiotics won't treat viral infections. Antibiotics never sufficiently cleared out that area for me either... only saline sinus rinses worked.I'm not sure why your dentist said the infection would never go away. Perhaps he knows something you didn't state here.Oh now that I think about it... if 12 became infected in the pulp, that would have probably caused the sinus floor to drop so the root(s) are visibly sticking up into the sinus. I think salt water should treat the infection fine. Not sure if your tooth will ever recover though as it had lost its blood supply.On that note, oral antibiotics wouldn't be able to get into the tooth if the blood vessels no longer get into the tooth... as antibiotics only spread where capillary flow allows. Your remaining pulp should still be infected after oral antibiotic treatment if what I'm thinking is correct (an xray would help). A nasal antibiotic spray/rinse on the other hand... that would be able to get into the tooth... but salt water will do just fine if not better.Tesla said:\t\t\t-the dentist mentioned an endodontist for this type of RC through a bridge, but I am an NHS patient and I doubt treatment by endodontists are on the NHS\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nEndodontists have more schooling and have a larger skill set than general practitioners.From https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3872851/\n\"A comparison of tooth survival rates after endodontic treatment by endodontic specialists vs. general practitioners, in a [36 month long] multi-center study consisting of 350 teeth that met the inclusion criteria, showed a difference of only 98.1% vs. 89.7% (Alley et al., 2004).\"​\nTesla said:\t\t\t-I would prefer to avoid extraction for many reasons.

In the above link it will talk a lot about that (\"peri-implantitis\" is their word for implant infection). 20 year success rate for implants was 75.8%. Getting an implant at age 18 was among the worst decisions in my life. If you can afford it, go with the endodontist is my best guess... your medical professionals would best know what to do.Though I suppose the saline sinus rinse may help the issue? Did your dentist not mention saline sinus rinses to treat the sinus infection?I have more thoughts but I shouldn't speculate."

    "dialogue": "John Roberts: I made a few post last month about my teeth.  Just a quick note.  I am a 70 year old male.  I have two teeth missing besides my wisdom teeth.  I believe they would be #3 ( top right) and # 19 lower left. I have 5 crowns.  #7,8,9,2 and 30.  I had a cleaning and fluoride treatment on November 18th 2015.  I was having some discomfort with # 10 tooth but no trouble with any other teeth.  Since then I have had trouble with teeth hitting so most are really sensitive  and hurt when they touch together.  Right now the front four 7,8,9 10 hurt most of the time.  It really hurts when the front top teeth come in contact with-the bottom fronts like when I swallow.  I changed dentist after the  November appointment.  My original dentist had retired and I didn't care for the one who took his place.  I went to a different dentist told him my teeth were sensitive, sore and some where hitting after the November 18th appointment.  At that time the left rear bottom #18 tooth was hitting the top and the fronts and bottoms hitting.  He did some grinding on the left side then the right side started hitting.  Went back to him three times,  he ground on my teeth and they are still hitting and sensitive\nI did a lot of reading and decided to go to a orthodontist and see if he could help.  Went to him Monday and he thinks I am grinding my teeth.  Put me on some anitinflamatory medicine and I am suppose to call him back Monday and let him know if it helped.  I just can't. see how this could start overnight.  I don't have any of the symptoms of teeth grinding.  The jaw pain, headaches, all that stuff.  I have never had a grinding problem that I know of.  If I did I wonder if it could start all of a sudden?  As far as my bite goes it seems like the hitting part will move around also.  When I wake up in the morning and am laying in bed I can put my teeth together and I can feel a little discomfort wit the front teeth but the jaw teeth feel ok but ans the day goes on it seems like they start hitting worse.  Does anybody have any ideas on what could be wrong. svor1988: Teeth grinding is a common side effect of drugs, like antidepressant and ADHD drugs. Saliva production loss (dry mouth) is also a common side effect of drugs, and is very bad for your teeth.Get an inexpensive mouth-guard from a pharmacy and wear that at night for a couple weeks and see if that helps.Stay away from having your teeth ground down... your enamel is very valuable and unrivaled by current man-made products.Could be phosphorus deficiency. As you age you may be less able to absorb vitamins/minerals and may need to counter that with supplementation.Also, since you say #7,8,9,2 and 30 have crowns, and #7,8,9 10 is where most of the pain is, it is probable that one of those crowns has reached the end of its life, probably #8 or #9. They don't last forever, about 10 years on average. Does your breath smell bad (indicates decay)? Do you have a bad taste? Are they abnormally sensitive to heat or cold? Is is possible there is decay under the crown... try looking at the crevices between your teeth to spot any decay. Dental mirrors are inexpensive as well... John Roberts: I really do appreciate you taking the time to answer my post.  I have thought about the teeth grinding.  Like I said I am 70 years old.  I have been to the dentist every six months for a check up probably for the last 20 years.  In the last 20 I have had some dental work done.  My old dentist never mentioned anything about me grinding my teeth.  If I did it looks like he would have said something.  I just wouldn't think teeth grinding would start overnight but I might be wrong.  I did buy one of the over the counter night guards that you heat and form but I was afraid it might realign my jaw or something. \nGot ahead of myself.  I did the noninflammatory medicine.  No help.\nI totally agree with you on the grinding down of my teeth.  I don't want to do that.\nI don't know either about the   phosphorus deficiency either.  I am going to the va before too long.  I may ask them to check that.\nI did ask my wife about my breath.  She said my breath did change for a few days but then back to normal after all this started.  It seems like I have always had a bad taste in my mouth off and on.  I use Walgreens brand of Biotene and I would say I have dry mouth but have had for a long time.  \nMy teeth aren't really sensitive to heat or cold I would say.  If I get ice cream in the left back top of my mouth it bothers me but no where else and I drink hot chocolate and eat hot food without bother.  \nI have been to one dentist three times and the orthodontist once and they didn't say anything about a cavity. But all my teeth, not just one or two are like sore and sensitive. \nAs far as my teeth contacting or hitting (that is what's really hurting) I am beginning to wonder if I may have a jaw problem.  I told the dentist and orthodontist sometime it feels like I miss bite or something.  I read about TMJ and I really don't have any symptoms of that except I have trouble chewing and that's because my teeth are sore.  Other than that I don't think I have any symptoms of that.  I can tell my mouth posture has changed but it may be because I am try to keep my teeth from touching when I swallow.\nAt night is my most comfortable time.  Before I get up I can close my teeth together and the front lower bottom and top contact but I can't really feel either side jaw teeth contacting hard but after I get and going I can feel them starting to come together more and more until it really hurts.\nIt is just so strange that I was not having any problems with my teeth, except the one ( #7) before I went to the dentist that day.  I don't see where the fluoride treatment could have done anything to my teeth to make them hit but I a still not convinced that it didn't have something to do with all my teeth being sore and sensitive.\nSomeone did answer my post and they mentioned the cementum part of or around the tooth.  They say it contains fluoride itself and they say fluoride can penetrate the gums while you are getting a fluoride treatment especially with the trays.  I don't guess it it possible it affected this part of the tooth.  I am just reaching here but something is definitely wrong for all my teeth to hurt  and all of them to hurt after this treatment.  Just saying.  Once again I really appreciate you advice and will be glad for more.  Thanks svor1988: John Roberts said:\t\t\tI really do appreciate you taking the time to answer my post.  I have thought about the teeth grinding.  Like I said I am 70 years old.  I have been to the dentist every six months for a check up probably for the last 20 years.  In the last 20 I have had some dental work done.  My old dentist never mentioned anything about me grinding my teeth.  If I did it looks like he would have said something.  I just wouldn't think teeth grinding would start overnight but I might be wrong.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...If you have a partner you sleep next to at night, they'd be able to hear grinding at night. It can sound a bit like scratching your nails on a chalkboard back and forth all night.John Roberts said:\t\t\tI don't know either about the   phosphorus deficiency either.  I am going to the va before too long.  I may ask them to check that.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...As you age your body may become less able to absorb certain vitamins/minerals. That is one reason why mega dosed tablets exist for certain nutrients.John Roberts said:\t\t\tI use Walgreens brand of Biotene and I would say I have dry mouth but have had for a long time.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Biotene is a great product, I've used it. It can't emulate everything saliva does, for example acids are rapidly neutralized by buffers in natural saliva while consuming food. While it has phosphate and calcium in it, I suspect Biotene isn't the greatest for remineralization as it has an acidic pH, and I see claims that remineralization occurs only in slightly alkaline pH. But yes, it is one of the best products I can see on the market right now.Try to treat the dry mouth if you can. The issue can be to salivary stones, or even injuries- have you ever had deep cuts on your cheek which injured the paratoid gland or paratoid duct? Inspect the paratoid duct opening on the inside of both your cheeks. With your fingers inspect the base of your mouth under the tongue for any salivary stones down there.John Roberts said:\t\t\tI have been to one dentist three times and the orthodontist once and they didn't say anything about a cavity. But all my teeth, not just one or two are like sore and sensitive.\n\t\t\nClick to expand... Yes makes me suspect a nutritional deficiency. Dairy products are a good way to get calcium and phosphorus/phosphate. If you choose supplementation do 400mg magnesium, ~400mg calcium, ~400mg phosphorus. magnesium can be obtained from epsom salt. Calcium from tums. phosphorus from monosodium phosphate for example. When supplementing, just doing one and not the others may leech the others from your body & bones which is not what you want. If you get these from just normal diet I don't think you need to worry about that.My above guess about the source of the pain in all your teeth could be wrong. You did say all the pain started after the fluoride treatment didn't you? If so hopefully the pain will go away with time. Listerine with fluoride in it is quite acidic (pH ~3.5-4.3) so maybe the treatment you had was similarly acidic.Oh, could be the dry mouth too. Dry mouth is really bad for teeth.John Roberts said:\t\t\tAs far as my teeth contacting or hitting (that is what's really hurting) I am beginning to wonder if I may have a jaw problem.

John Roberts: Yes, like I said I was not having trouble with all this before I went for the cleaning and fluoride treatment.  I went to the orthodontist office today and gave them some notes as to what has been happening the last week since I too the medication ( Flurbiprofen 100 mg three times a day)  I told them nothing has changed.  They gave the notes to the doctor and he wants me to go to a Endodonist and let them check the nerves in my teeth and teeth  grinding or whatever they do.  I do think the dentist  I went to should have tried to figure out what is wrong before he started grinding but that is probably my fault.  I hope he didn't grind too much of my natural teeth.  I was and am looking for relief and I didn't realize grinding on my teeth could be so bad. I guess I'll see what the endodonist can tell me.  I'll keep you posted if I find out anything or think of anything else to add to the post.  Thanks"

    "dialogue": "Jamis028: About 3 years ago, the dentist I was working for decided to do a complete occlusal adjustment on me to \"make my bite better\". I was completely asymptomatic at this time. I did not realize there was any risk with this procedure and let her do it. She adjusted almost all my teeth and took down at least 1mm of enamel on some of my molars. I noticed right away the next day that my front teeth ached and I felt like I had a lisp. I couldn't talk right at all and I couldn't find a comfortable place to bite. Her solution was to keep grinding my teeth. Eventually I stopped seeing her and suffered for a few years with the pain. My front teeth constantly ache. They hit when I talk and I am developing black triangle between my front teeth. I have tried to get several opinions and I eventually went through ortho again but it made things much worse. I am feeling very hopeless and want this nightmare to end. Does anyone have any experience with this or advice? John Roberts: Did you ever get the problem solved.  I am having trouble like yours."

    "title": "How do I access images of my teeth x-rays on a dvd the dentist gave me to take to a prosthodontist?",
    "dialogue": "Gary Goldstein: I saw a dentist, Dr. H, last week because a porcelain crown installed by a former dentist, who installed 20 crowns in 2007, broke off with my tooth attached. (I asked for veneers, the former dentist called them veneers and the bill says veneers but they cover my entire tooth and I now understand that to be a crown).\nDr. H's assistant (?) took a few photos with a camera and then took me into another room, asked me to stand still and a machine with 2 compartments, opposite each other, circled my head a few times.\nDr. H then examined my teeth, said my gums looked good but the broken tooth was a result of the crown/veneer leaking and that others appeared to be leaking because the bonding was failing. He said that he did not have the skills to undo the damage done by the former dentist because I also had an overbite and referred me to what appears to be a top prosthodontist. He also told me that he was sorry this happened to me. I have seen 5 dentists over the years and he is the only one who has told me what \nThey gave me a referral sheet and a DVD with \"3D\" written on it, the rushed me out, no charge for anything. I protested and said I would like to pay for the consultation and the camera/machine(radiograph?), so as not to feel obligated in case I had questions but they practically pushed me out the door. Of course I was anxious to know what was on the DVD and the Prosthodontist did not have an opening for 3 weeks. I went to Best Buy and asked what I need to download the digitals onto my MacAir and the Geek attempted to download the images on a PC but it is password protected. \nI called the office the next day and asked the receptionist if I could pay for them to print the images. She said that everyone was with patients and she would get back to me. They have never called.\nDo I have any rights to see these images since they refused payment? I assume I was exposed to some radiation and that should count for something. I feel frightened that there is bone deterioration or worse.\nThe incident inspired me to rummage through old boxes and find photos of my teeth before the work, when I had NO overbite (I do have a serious overbite now and my back teeth do not touch). I found some pictures and cried because my teeth were so nice. I never had teeth problems other than a few cavities in my back molars. I was so sad after my mother died that I thought a smile makeover would help me to start smiling again.\nDoes anyone know how I can access the images on the DVD? I could arrange an appointment with another dentist, assuming they have similar software, but Dr. H's office has the password. \nAny suggestions, please. I already have an infected partial tooth and would like to know if my bones are disintegrating. I have horrible sinus problems and tinnitus and wonder if those have been caused by the bad dental work. The former dentist ground my healthy teeth into tiny nubs and I was told by two dentists that I consulted later that they would have to cut my gums to be able to bond a new crown that kept falling off.\nI am sorry this is so long. I am confused and scared with nowhere to turn. svor1988: Libraries often assist with such digital issues like that, consider trying there. There isn't anything I can do without access to that data.

Please contact your insurance company and compare what they have record and what you have on record.I had a past dentist who did not submit certain claims to the insurance company in order to reduce the paper trail as he chose not to pay income taxes on those payments- he was caught due to a diligent patient who noticed the discrepancies.In your case perhaps he billed you for 20 veneers and the insurance company for 20 crowns?

And for just reading my post. I do not feel so desperate now.I thought that doctors needed our consent for radiation exposure?I do not have dental insurance. I did not need it because I had not had a cavity in 20 years before this cosmetic procedure. Also my procedure was only cosmetic and insurance will not pay for that.You are right about crowns, some of which fail at only 5 years, I read.  Of course I thought I had veneers and they have a longer lifespan. No one told me to watch for leakage. I guess I thought they would all eventually crack and fall off the still healthy nub, since that is what two others did. A dentist told me in 2011 that they would have to be covered or they would rot and I would lose the teeth. I said \"What teeth? I don't have any teeth. My teeth were drilled away! I have nubs, not teeth!\" Truth and humor but I was the only one to laugh.\nNevertheless they are still there without enamel or cavities. The cavity was inside the veneer/crown that broke.\nI have not had a second of pain so there was no way to know. Two recently consulted dentists have told me that I do not have any periodontal disease. If I do not have bacteria and plaque in my gums why would I think it might be inside my bonded crowns? Maybe this is what \"oil pulling\" is for?\nActually I am lucky that one broke before the others since some might still be okay. Although I have considered that no teeth/nubs might be the best way to resolve everything forever, my knees get weak when I hear the word \"extraction\".I was really stupid to do this. I honestly thought he was pasting those thin veneers on my teeth. They were being advertised in the magazines. Da Vinci veneers. He said he had someone better than DaVinci. Then the day came that he said he had to take a little enamel off.  When he handed me the mirror I nearly fainted. I will never forget that day. I wanted to scream. I wish I had now.I know an African medical doctor in his 40s who has beautiful teeth and has never had a cavity. He also avoids dentists preferring to take care of his teeth himself. Why not study people such as that and find out what they are doing right?\nI have an appointment with a prosthodontist other than the one I was referred to and I think will be more open to non-standard approaches. I think but who knows. I have read about new developments in correcting overbite, not braces, but contraptions that fit in your mouth. But my teeth have to be fixed first, I think. He has the equipment to view the images and I will ask for prints or I will use my iPhone and photograph them. That should work, do you think? If he protests I will know we are not a good fit. I described the machine to his receptionist and she said it was the panoramic or whatever. I do know that it exposes one to radiation they say is not dangerous. I guess we will find out in the future.So I still have hope that I can return to something reminiscent of the my original teeth/mouth and face. We'll see. \nThis is an edit to say that the receptionist just called and they have a cancellation for Wednesday! Otherwise it would be 2 weeks. I had told her my story when I called so maybe that helped. So things are looking up!"

    "dialogue": "Deydey: I would like to know from a dentist point of view if I was right to feel the way I felt or if this is how it's supposed to go in the dentist office, here it is;Briefly describing overall, he was really nice, extremely nice to the point where when he would describe my teeth ex: \"have you notice the space you have over there? \" I would say yes. And he would add \"but it's nothing bad, we all have our imperfections like me look I also have a space there *\" he would tell me that he finds my profile beautiful ( not randomly, we were talking about it but still) and he had a huge smile from the beginning till the end of my appointment, giggling.also at some point my face was against his body, really touching it (touching his lower belly or hopefully dick ) the right side of my face was against him while he was just doing a cleaning..And more but that's the most important I guess, at the end of my appointment when the assistant is supposed to walk me back to the front he stepped in between us and said that HE will walk me back, while walking me back I had that strong gut feeling that he was gonna ask me for my number, skip forward after some talking he ended up writing his cell phone number telling me to call him if I have questions while \"blinking\" at me.. OHH and also when he left after handing me that paper, before entering the room he was about to enter he turned his head to take a last look at me, he literally turned 180° and looked straight at me, for I don't know what? He came out 2 more times and did it again the 2 times, WHY DO YOU GUYS THINK HE TURNED BEFORE LEAVING TO LOOK AT ME? I just went for a normal check up, no surgery or anything, WAS HE INTERESTED IN ME? For the record, I'm really into him.Also, he wrote his private cell phone number under his name on a reference, the reference was for me to see an orthodontist.. The reference tho was FOR ME not for the orthodontist. The orthodontist did confirm to me that I don't need to bring any reference since he doesnt need it and it's for the client (me)."

He tooth 2 fillings out of one tooth on top left 3 from the back.  He repaired a crack in the tooth and replace the two fillings.\nIntermittent pain/discomfort continued.\nI went back to my regular dentist to say i think it is the back left wisdom tooth because again it is painful 'sometimes' and when I close my mouth and the wisdom tooth is touched by the lower teeth it feels painful.  Again I repeat it is not all the time.\nI have had physic for my knee and my physic has massaged my neck and done acupuncture twice now and suggested I keep my head up and chin in.\nHe also questioned my pillows.  I sleep on my side and I think my head is held well.\nI do however feel my teeth discomfort/pain when I am in bed not moving.Has any body help or experienced/seen these symptoms beforethank you in advancePaul Maguire\nSolihull\nUK Paul Maguire: Hello everyoneI thought it may be helpful to update anybody who may have similar symptoms.I think I had a trapped nerve in the neck/head area.I have been having physio for my knee and the Physio did some neck massage.I had a few sessions  with a personal trainer who was also an Osteopath who did his masters in the neck.He thought it may be Trigeminal Neuralgia because there is  nerve that runs 3 ways (I think) near to the lower jaw and teeth.I get the sensation/pain when I am driving and when I'm lying in bed.The symptoms are random and difficult to re-create.He said I should de-stress as much as possible.  So I have cut out drinking at home and endeavoured to be more relaxed at work.I have changed from 2 pillows to 1 pillow to keep my head perpendicular to the shoulders when lying in bed and fairly straight when lying on my back.For the last 2 days the symptoms have gone.  I still get some minor sensations in my teeth when eating some things.\neg.  today a banana that was cold after sitting in the van all day.So my thoughts are that people should maybe look to possible trapped nerves. I don't think my issue was teeth related.kind RegardsPaul Maguire svor1988: From https://www.tulsadentalcare.com/white-fillings-reduce-risk-of-galvanic-shock/\n\"Galvanic shock, a term used in dentistry for over 100 years, refers to an electric charge in your mouth between two fillings. This uncomfortable charge occurs when two metal amalgam fillings of dissimilar metal composition come together or are placed too close together. When this happens, they complete an electrochemical circuit through the soft tissue and nerves inside of your tooth. Afflicted teeth can feel painful or sensitive.Occurrences of galvanic shock are extremely rare. Dentists train extensively in the placement of dental fillings in order to prevent this uncomfortable condition. Once upon a time, your best bet was to stick with the same dentist to ensure similar composition in every amalgam filling you received. Thanks to new technologies, dentists can now check the composition of older fillings in order to create new fillings that will not cause problems.\"​With composite fillings you should not experience this issue.It is possible you may feel tiny electrical shocks through other chemically/mechanically induced means.Make sure you are getting enough magnesium/calcium/phosphorous and eating fruits and veggies in your diet. Paul Maguire: Thank you Svor1988 it is very kind of you to have commented.I will certainly look at the magnesium/calcium/phosphorous intake.I have brushing my teeth with Duraphat 2800 and had some massage and 'needling' on the muscles and nerves in my neck and right jaw.  I have also had some massage inside the mouth at the back between the upper and lower row of teeth.I thought it was going really well until I went for my 6 monthly check up and the hygienist cleaned my teeth.  I was back to square one in terms of pain and discomfort when eating because all the protection from the Duraphat was scrubbed away.  I get discomfort while eating for a while then it dies down (say after approx 30sec).. I am also getting some discomfort in the middle of the night from the nerves and strangely when I shower. This makes me think it is posture related - or to do with the position of the jaw/neck.   So I think I have sensitive nerves which are near the surface of the tooth (top right 3 from the back) and a tooth issue which allows for the said nerve to triggered/made uncomfortable/painful.I am continuing with the massage and using the Duraphat, using one pillow to sleep and keeping my head up and my jaw back.  I will look at supplements based on your advice.The dentists advice is if the discomfort has gone down from 8.5/10 down to between 1 & 2.  Result keep doing what you are doing.thanks againYoursPaul Maguire svor1988: Yes, sorry I don't really see clear issues I can help you with other than to encourage you have adequate nutrition so your body can do what it does best, and keep working with your existing doctors.If you decide on magnesium/calcium/phosphorous supplements (instead of just making sure you're getting enough from normal food), make sure not to just do one supplement (match them in a 1:1 weight ratio):If you take just magnesium, then it pulls calcium out of the body/bones (L. S. PALMER et al., 1928).\nIf you do just calcium, it pulls magnesium out of your body/bones.\nI've found most all magnesium supplementation ad-revenue websites fail to mention this critical issue... which probably causes a lot of people some harm.Webmd has dosage information for magnesium, 400mg/day for me."

    "title": "Why ask personal questions on Patient History Form?",
    "dialogue": "Dialtone: My daughter needs braces. OK...So I take her to the referred to Orthodontist. They wanted to know where I and my wife worked. I wrote the answer and the lady made a comment that since my wife was a professional, they'd give us a 10% professional discount. Ummmm, WHAT?The estimate was about $6,000.00 I was shocked. I have a feeling they jacked up the price before the \"professional discount\" and still wanted more that was a fair price.We're going to a second place and danged if the form for them, doesn't ask the same questions about where we work and what are our positions. That just sounds like they will price people based on what they think is our income.What's really going on here? Does anyone really understand this new line of personal questioning?I'm ready to tell them my wife is a stay at home mom who has mobility challenges. John Roberts: Shoot, I'd try that.  I've come to the conclusion I don't think I trust any of them.  I went to a orthodontist the other day and I didn't get a good feeling about him.  My teeth are hitting together and hurt.  He gave me some medicine to try and basically said it that didn't work it would cost me lots of money.  Don't know if I am going back or not.  They didn't ask me what my wife did though. Dialtone: Thanks for replying and I understand frustration at some medical \"professionals.\" I quit one after he told me that I didn't have any pain in a tooth.Sadly, that was after he said, \"Ooops,\" while trying to grind down a tooth for a crown. Seems he went too far down and exposed the nerve. His solution was to suggest it'd be just fine after the crown was set. Nope, it wasn't, so he said he wouldn't charge to do a root canal through the top of the crown. I did see where he didn't bill ME, but tried to bill the insurance company. Shortly after that is when he told me I didn't have any pain in a tooth which was causing pain. svor1988: Yes, never answer any questions about where you work. For obvious reasons as you had mentioned. You're approaching this the right way.Does she really need braces? Out of cosmetic \"need\" or genuine medical need? Be aware if teeth are moved too far too fast or even back and forth with repititon, it may kill the tooth- this is what happened to one of my molars.Be aware if this is for cosmetics, she'd need to wear a retainer for life or the teeth will just move back to their natural positions. Skipping the retainer for a while would make it so it wouldn't fit anymore. Permanent retainers behind the front teeth exist as well but I've had trouble with mine causing a stress fracture & cavity on my canine (due to a hard to clean crevice created). Wasn't worth the pain & expenses by a long shot- my teeth were in good shape in the first place, and I lost a good molar and soon to be canine I expect.Get an invoice at time of service so you can dispute any claims then and there. There is a lot of upselling in this industry just as there is with professional car mechanics... Also verify the invoice matches your insurance company's record. One of my past denstists didn't submit certain claims to the insurance company in order to remove a paper trail so they could get away with not paying taxes on those payments/income.There are many trustworthy dentists, but there are also many unethical ones driven by greed. The trustworthy & honourable professionals would be wise to report misconduct they see done by other practitioners instead of protecting them...Trust your gut instincts. Dialtone: Great Advice! Thanks for replying. Our current long term dentist referred us to an orthodontist a few years ago. They said her thumb sucking pulled her pallet out a bit and it should be looked at. I did take her, but when they said she had pretty teeth, I discounted the \"need\" to get them. The subject was dropped and forgotten about. However, the last three visits to the dentist for cleanings, they ask about her going to see an Orthodontist. So, I thought maybe something really needed attention.Since I didn't care for the prior referral office, I got suggestions for some others. I did like how they took pictures and showed the trouble areas, Mainly, on the left side , her teeth were very lined up one to one. On the right side, they were staggered. The left side could cause uneven pressures on the jaw and lead to pain and other issues if not corrected.The other was her front teeth having a gap and not having the upper front overlapping the bottom teeth. Well, it seems reasonable to get some adjustments from what he pointed out. Just not a +6,000.00 dollar adjustment.I moved to Ohio with my wife and we found a local dentist, whom seemed nice. She was really into up-selling like you mentioned. Took lots of pictures of my teeth and pointed at all the \"decay\" and said they needed to replace the amalgam fillings, ASAP. I was quite shocked by that and just stopped going. My wife, had quite the opposite experience. Her teeth had poor care during her life in another country. The dentist treated her really well and didn't try to do extra services to her like she had done with me.One thing she did do though, was to give my wife Whitening treatments to take home. For Free. Her teeth had not been pearly white, due to medications commonly used years ago. We weren't billed, nor was our insurance. I never quite understood why all that happened with that dentist. It's 12 years later and my 40 some odd year old amalgam fillings seem to be just fine."

I do have a mouthguard (£70 here in the UK )  but don't use it as it feels wiered ! As my teeth are small, I would like to  have them built up, but I'm not sure if that is possible both on a medical & maybe a financial basis, as  I don't get free dental care. I do have sharp edges on my teeth & around \"unfilled\" cavities\n  These cavities have been filled before, but the fillings keep falling out. The question still remains - why do I keep damaging myself this way in the first place ?"

    "dialogue": "juntjoo: Maybe 9 months ago an old filling fell out while flossing so I went to a local dentist to have it refilled and afterwards and ever since the top of my tooth is sensitive. I can eat but have to do so carefully and often there is slight pain. When I went back to have it checked out all they were concerned with was the possibility that they filled it too high but I'm wondering now if the problem was they didn't fill it enough as I can tell it's lower than before the original fell out. I didn't mention it to them because they were so concerned that it was too high but now I'm regretting not mentioning it. juntjoo: Hello out there. Any dentists or dental students have any ideas for me? Tone-Analyst: I'm not a professional but here's my opinion. If your filling was so far gone/broken as to just flake off while flossing, cavity may have formed behind and they may have had to drill a bit closer to the nerve to put a new filling and that may cause you tooth to be more sensitive. However, pain ongoing after 9 months is not a good sign. It's possible the nerve had been affected and a root canal treatment may be necessary. About having filled too high or too low. The only concern is filling too high because it creates a high point of contact and prevents the other teeth from closing together properly, as well as putting a lot of pressure on that high spot. Less filling is not really a concern, as long as the tooth is well covered. juntjoo: Tone-Analyst said:\t\t\tI'm not a professional but here's my opinion.

I suppose that's possible be drilled a bit too much, or as much was needed and the nerve just couldn't take it. Fortunately it's not time for a root canal as it's not that bad. It's just a spot or two right on the top where it's definitely more shallow than before. My dentist said, recently after another visit that, totally doubting my hypothesis that whatever (tiny)amount that he under filled it, it wouldn't matter which doesn't make sense to me as that is suggesting no protection is needed over the nerve because as I see it, obviously that is the point of the filling, so the question is how much exactly is needed which I didn't quite articulate and let him basically poop on my idea then left. But I find it totally plausible that he didn't fill it to the amount that is needed to not feel pain. I mean, there is, must be, a definite line/level that must be reached to sufficiently protect the tooth right? And he didn't address exactly what that line would be and I suspect he just can't say exactly which leaves open the possibility he didn't reach it, but as with most experts they have an ego that is connected to their titles. But I'm going a bit off here. He could be right or not but he just seemed to be opining like myself. All I know was one day it was fine, filling dropped out, couple days later it was refilled slightly lower and now slight pain I have to be mindful of. So yeah, could be that the nerve didn't like the last unavoidable job, or the dentist didn't do it totally right.  Oh well I guess. He offered to add more and maybe I should have take him up on the offer but 1 if he's right that adding more would probably make it worse, just more work = more tooth trauma, and I don't want want anyone doing that kinda work on me without confidence in the work. But luckily it's not going to require a root canal any time soon at least. So all in all I'm lucky I can eat comfortably for the most part. svor1988: Could have been cured incompletely.

I will have to take care of this with another dentist. After that last visit when I turned down his offer to fill it some more I called back a couple days later to take him up on that offer if it didn't expire, especially as he seemed so concerned, at least that is what his fake face expressed, and apparently not only did that offer expire, our relationship did lol. His receptionist basically broke up with me over the phone telling me he would no longer take me as a patient. Not that I expected him to tell me this at that last visit but the fakeness of his whole act telling me he could tell I wasn't happy, duh, what did he expect? Felt condescending the way he said that now that I think back about it. He was probably thinking condescendingly towards me. 'awe, you're feelings are hurt' what an unprofessional douchebag. I wasn't rude in any way, simply I was using my brain and expressing myself honestly and politely and apparently HE was the one who's feelings were so badly hurt. He just proved my point that you ought not take some \"expert's\" word on anything. He's no more an expert than your typical auto mechanic. Maybe I've had bad experiences with them but you'd expect a bit more expertise from someone working on your body, your health. As an expert one should know it's possible they've messed up, and regardless, a patient should be encouraged to second guess an expert's imperfect knowledge. Anyway...

Just a hunch... in my state news articles talk about how there are too many medical schools churning out too many medical professionals and how the population can't support them all.Driven by greed, some dentists do not put your best interests above all else in their services to you. They may omit information would would help you make the best decision for you. Make sure your friends and family do not make the same mistake. Never return to that dentist, and leave a review on Yelp and say \"I do not feel my best interests were put above all else.\" Other people should know exactly what that means.I would strongly advise against elaborating with any other details in a public review as you may mistakenly make a statement that could be untrue and thus defamatory (and public untrue statements can be bad for you). Writing a review on Google is no good as they can hide any negative reviews from the public... Yelp does not allow the suppression of negative reviews while Google does.There is a lot of upselling in this industry just as there is with professional car mechanics... I agree, it is a good analogy. Also verify the invoice matches your insurance company's record. One of my past denstists didn't submit certain claims paid with cash to the insurance company in order to remove a paper trail so they could get away with not paying taxes on those payments/income.There are many trustworthy dentists, but there are also many unethical ones driven by greed. The trustworthy & honourable professionals would be wise to report misconduct they see done by other practitioners instead of protecting them...Yes I'd consider calling your insurance company and file a complaint if he is unwilling to fix the issue with the filling, and get a refund that way. You may also file a complaint with your state medical board if you are in the U.S."

    "dialogue": "Jade Whyley: Hi all,I have not posted like this before, but I am in a desperate situation.\nI have a root Canal, that I believe also has a pin, and is crowned. This is at the top on the right hand side. This was done in 2012, and has never cause much aggro, apart from when I am particularly tired and stressed, it would be painful. In the  last 6 weeks I have had constant pain all in this area, as well as all round the air. It is not sensitive and I can eat fine, it is just sharp and incredibly painful.I first off went to the Dr as I thought it could be sinus infection, as I had had a cold recently but she advised me to go the dentist. The dentist done an X ray and said there was some inflammation from the sinus coming down so gave me antibiotics. The tooth pain got a bit better, but the ear had not, so they sent me back to Drs. He said there is definite tenderness around my ear and Jaw, so thinks it could be TMJ and thinks I have been exhausted so to rest over Xmas and he believes it will go on it's own.Last night the pain around where my root canal tooth is, was unbearable pain i was in tears most of the night. I simply do not know what to do.It is very weird as last Xmas I had nearly exactly the same thing, and I went to emergency dentist due to tooth pain in the same place. They said I would probably need the tooth extracted. I was pretty devastated by this, but weirdly the pain went off, and for almost a year, so I am wondering whether this will happen again.I am very worried. Should I visit a different dentist for a second opinion, should I wait it out and see if it gets better?Any help would be much appreciated.Thanks in advance.\nJade svor1988: It would be helpful to know which tooth this is.For example the top molars lie under the maxillary sinus. Research 'Maxillary sinusitis root canal' if this is the case. The issue here is that you have a root canal treated tooth (a dead tooth) perforating the sinus. Bone tends to subside from not-living teeth. And treating a tooth with a root canal does not always clear out all source of infection in that tooth due to a network of ingestible tissue (by pathogens) in those roots.Treatment would be a saline sinus rinse, multiple times daily as needed for pain, and then for a few days after for good measure. You don't need a doctor or a fancy product. Just salt, water, and a shallow bowl/cup: http://www.wikihow.com/Flush-SinusesIn my case, the clean infection free environment caused by saline sinus rinses eventually allowed the bone to grow up over the perforating object (in my case an implant). The floor of the sinus does rise and lower. It was indeed years unbearable pain during the repeating chronic infections with which many doctors did not know how to help me... they all happily took my money though... I had to figure this out on my own. Through this perforation oral flora goes up, and sinus flora comes down, and they overwhelm the bodies defenses and infect the bone there, spreading.But your situation may indeed not be a perforation of the maxillary sinus of dental cause. It would be helpful to know which tooth it is and see an xray, though I suspect I have identified the issue based on your description."

My next to back right on the bottom is also crowned and a root canal.  I had started having a little trouble with the tooth to the right of my front tooth feeling a little discomfort.  I went in to the dentist 11/18/16 for a cleaning and to have them check this.  My old dentist had retired which I hated.  The new dentist blurted out I needed to have this tooth crowned and the tooth next to it filled.  She didn't give me much of a explanation.  Anyway after my cleaning the girl asked me if I wanted a fluoride treatment and unfortunately I said yes.  I have never had one before.  Since that day I have suffered with most all my teeth hurting and so sensitive I can't hardly touch them.  It was not like this before I had the fluoride  treatment.  My front teeth touch when I swallow and close my mouth and it hurts the top and bottom teeth.  I was not having any trouble like this before the treatment.  Can anybody please shed any light on this.  I have read on the net trying to find anything on this till I'm tired.  I do have receded gums.  I did have the trey type fluoride treatment and I read that it is possible it could penetrate you gums during the treatment.  Could this have done something to the nerves my teeth.  One of my teeth in the front has had a root canal and it is hurting just like the rest..  Any suggestions or information would be appreciated.  Oh.   I have brushed with Sensodine for years. John Roberts: Anybody? svor1988: Fluoride is toxic to tissue and organs... It is great for enamel on teeth though. Rinse and never ingest, it is toxic. I suppose there could be something else in their fluoride treatment product... phone them and ask them to identify the product so you can research the ingredients or see if any others experienced what you did with that product.As an example of bad dental products, for a period of time there was a toxic chemical used in root canal fillings which caused pain and other baddies. It was identified and outlawed, and I saw a case where a dentist in the U.S. had used a product containing it- likely imported.Could also be an issue with exposed cementum. It is possible said fluoride treatment should only be placed on enamel, and never cementum- I do not know."

Your molars drift/push forward naturally and close gaps back there. With premolars, incisors and canines I don't know if they have a consistent and predictable drift tendency other than staying put. I think I read that premolars may drift backwards pushing against the molars.I find often people are not willing to wear a retainer at night for the rest of their lives after they had braces in childhood, so their teeth revert back to how they were. Yes braces can cause complications, like a molar loss in my case due to too much movement.You said your teeth adjacent are crowded? Then yes, removal will likely result in that gap being mostly closed (possibly not completely). I'm not sure of your situation but you could always just leave the tooth there... I've had a baby premolar I chew on with hardly any root left that has been there for 15 years. The root dissolved as preparation to be replaced by an adult tooth, but no adult tooth formed due to genetics. It is great, I love that tooth."

    "dialogue": "Tone-Analyst: For 2 years I had pain in my lower right 1st molar. My dentist said it was probably just sensitivity and such.. The filling looked good from the outside and the X-ray showed it was far from the nerve, and that there was no abscess. Now 2 months ago that pain got worse, the right side of my thyroid gland started hurting, my parotid and sub-mandibular glands were swollen and hurting. The muscles in my neck became really sore, I could barely turn my head. I could also feel other glands swollen, and the pain started creeping into my brain from behind my neck. I told the dentist to drill anyways, I'll pay for it..  Surprise!!! There was a huge cavity under, some chunks of the tooth broke off so much it was impacted. He told me the cavity had made it's way right next to the nerve now and if I still had any pain a root canal would be necessary.Now 2 months later, all the symptoms are only 3/4 gone. I still have pain in my parotid gland, sub-mandibular. I still have inflammation in my right side rear neck creeping into my right brain lobe. I went back to the dentist and, again he says there is no abcess, and that because I have feeling inside the tooth, that the nerve is ok.

It's really frustrating..Is it normal that my glands not be healed yet after 2 months? I relaly feel there is still infection in there and I am tempted to tell him to just rip that tooth out.. svor1988: Yes, a root canal treated tooth is a dead tooth. Is is possible he missed a bit of the root, or there is still infection surrounding. Happened with me, the issue was not removed until the root canal treated tooth was removed. Don't replace the tooth with an implant due to that infection and close nerve- the infection would likely lead to a premature implant failure.Consider first taking a prescription oral antibiotic treatment for your surrounding inflammation to ensure your paratoid and submandibular glands do not take damage and atrophy. Then after that consider removal of that tooth. Follow your gut instincts! Sounds like you have naturally good with that."

She had been to dentist in June, told she had one possible cavity that needed watched. Took her to new \"adult\" dentist, she's 18. They said she now has 8 cavities. Told it was because she had gone away to college, they see it happen a lot, etc. etc. Her dental hygiene may be not as perfect as when at home, but she is a dancer and model and takes care of her health, body etc. Does not drink but and occasional soda, no juice, mainly water.I just went along with it and she has had part of them fixed, and will do the others in a few weeks.Fast forward to my youngest (just turned 16). She went in for regular 6 mo cleaning, exam and fluoride treatment. No cavities, nothing they are watching and only recommendation was time to check about wisdom teeth removal (again, she's 16). Also a health nut - hates soda and juice and milk, only drinks water. Also dancer, so very careful about what she eats, keeps teeth cleaned, both girls could probably floss better...So one day after her appt, her permanent retainer wire she has on her top teeth broke loose on one end. I'm sure they messed it up, it's been fine since she's had it. Well - they were closed early that day and not open the next, it was hanging from her teeth so I took her to our family dentist. They were able to squeeze her in. They fixed it, but had a concern because they said they could see a visible cavity on one of the teeth behind it.So, I made an appointment with them for a full exam. \nOn X-rays, and IN her mouth they showed me what they found - 12 cavities. some are \"kissing\" cavities, in between teeth. So - older daughter, I explained it away to myself, it had been 6 months, she was away at college, etc.\nBut My other daughter had just had a full exam and cleaning less than two weeks before.Older daughter had some pain. Younger daughter none.\nOne cavity on younger daughter, he said it could have been missed by her or Mom, but not a doctor or X-ray. She showed it to me, the cavity is large enough, it's almost crown worthy.I'm horrified, and either suspicious, foolish or both.I'm tempted to figure out how to get a 3rd opinion, neutral, which I don't even know if it's possible.I have not told the pediatric dentist what the family dentist has found yet. About to in about 30 min. from now.Has anyone ever had conflicting dental diagnosis like these?\nAny advice is WELCOME - I am in shock. svor1988: Can you see any of the decay with your eyes visibly? It could be superficial, or just staining...Yes, you can get a 3rd opinion and quote. I would, with that much work.Dentin has a critical pH of 6.7.\nCementum also has a critical pH of 6.7.\nNatural enamel (Hydroxylapatite) has a critical pH of 5.5.\nFluoride treated enamel (Fluorapatite) has a critical pH of 4.5.\nLactic acid has a pH of 3.51.\nLactic acid is largely what causes cavities, due to the fermentation of sugar and starch by naturaly occuring bacteria after 4-5 hours.\nMinerals in saliva remineralize the teeth, and reverses demineralization of the teeth caused by lactic acid.Look into your daughter's diet changes. Perhaps she is using acidic things? Eating lemons strait? Using hydrogen peroxide as a mouthwash or tooth whitener?When they fix any cavities, make them cure the each cavity with 2 UV cycles... I've had a dentist assistant take the tool away halfway through one cycle... the filling fell out a few hours later and he tried billing me twice to fix his office's mistake... and I strongly believe that mistake was intentional... I could see the dental assistant felt guilty as she left the room without a word.You mentioned wisdom teeth... Wisdom teeth removal is rarely medically necessary. Gives a nice insurance payment of a few hundred for each of them though. This practice is pretty pervasive in the industry and you can read online about the reasons... I suggest you have your daughters keep the teeth, they'll be handy to replace other teeth lost later in life. Any resultant eruption problems they may cite may be countered by wearing an inexpensive mouth-guard nightly. If they cite impact issues it's likely sheer impact which will cause temporary pain during the eruption- look at the xray yourself and make a judgement. If the wisdom tooth is literally horizontal, literally beneath the adjacent tooth such that eruption would erupt the other tooth, or severely deformed those would be good medically necessary reasons for removal.

They have a lifespan of 25 years on average, and you should avoid chewing using them as they aren't as able as your natural teeth are to handle the forces involved. If you have molars behind the gap, they'll push forward to close the gap. If that movement or existing gap causes a tooth to erupt, wear an inexpensive mouth-guard from a pharmacy at night to fix that eruption. You should treat the eruption promptly as the exposed cementum is quite vulnerable to acid.Bridges don't last long either, in terms of your lifespan, and they take away valuable enamel which is currently unrivaled by manmade materials.Once the implant fails, you may be unable to get a replacement implant there anyway due to bone loss. They may attempt to do a bone graft to get sufficient bone there, but that can fail too.\"Being told I really can't go without a tooth there\" HA!

Consider magnesium, calcium, and phosphate supplementation.Some pharmaceuticals can reduce characteristics of your body's healing mechanisms, such as warfarin which interferes with the formation of bone and cartilage. In my opinion warfarin has led to a lot of hip replacements via this mechanism...Also avoid flouride products during this time when the flouride can get deep into your tissues... it is toxic to certain orgains, and may inhibit the tissue healing process. It is great for your teeth, so resume fluoride product usage after your tissues had healed up."

    "dialogue": "John Lungo: There's a pic attached.I don't know why, but I'm just getting annoyed by this tooth at the age of 28. It has never bothered me until now.But now it's REALLY bothering me. So many people have straight teeth. Not sure why my parents didn't get me braces, probably because it was only one tooth but man.... it's the front.Sometimes when I smile it looks like I'm missing that tooth. I just feel like people think it's gross.Please give honest opinions.What do you think?Thanks. svor1988: Looks fine to me. I've always regretted braces. 4 years of pain just for slight cosmetic adjustments and it killed one of my molars due to moving it back and forth a large distance unnaturally. Also... they often don't advertise during the sell that you have to wear a retainer every night for the rest of your life or your teeth will move back to how they were before the braces. Uncomfortable to say the least. They never told me this until the day they finally took off the braces... My sister said screw that and never wore it.I'd only advise braces if medically necessary- cosmetics are not medically necessary."

    "title": "Bonding vs Crowns/big mistake",
    "dialogue": "Orange24: So I chipped half of my tooth when I was little... I was like 8.I am 18, and a dentist suggested me Dental crowns for it. I asked for bonding, but he said it was too big of a lose to do bonding. Is he right?So my dentist did crowns and I just feel so guilty. Like I think I could've done bonding, bonding, then crowns at the end of my life. \nBut me being stupid, went with crowns and it is now too late. My parents are jabbing at me for it because it's expensive and that bonding is better since I am 18. After reading countless articles, I feel like I made the stupidest mistake in life, which is choosing crowns over bonding and then going to a dentist that my parents recommended. \nIdk... i feel like this dentist ripped me off. He shaved both my tooth down... which they did not need. Only 1 needed to be fixed. again, I said nothing. I am just so heartbroken. I don't think I can get over it... svor1988: I'm really sorry. I was similarly taken advantage of right after I turned 18 and was able to make such decisions on my own... Whenever they want high dollar work done, you should go to 1-2 other dentists and get quotes from them, calling first for a rough quote before setting up an inspection. This will cost a little, but it will either reassure you that this is either (1) indeed the right course of action or, (2) not appropriate.I don't know the details of your situation, or how much of your tooth was chipped off.The truth is that the human tooth is a remarkable structure which is unrivaled by anything currently man-made. Driven by greed, some dentists do not put your best interests above all else in their services to you. They may omit information would would help you make the best decision for you. Make sure your friends and family do not make the same mistake. Never return to that dentist, and leave a review on Yelp and say \"I do not feel my best interests were put above all else.\" Other people should know exactly what that means.I would strongly advise against elaborating with any other details in a public review as you are young and may make a statement that could be untrue and thus defamatory (and public untrue statements can be bad for you). Writing a review on Google is no good as they can hide any negative reviews from the public... Yelp does not allow the suppression of negative reviews.Though first, I would call this dentist, and let him know your feelings and give him a chance to defend himself.Since I'm here and thinking about it, a parallel exists in the financial world. There exists professionals with titles of 'financial advisor' and 'fiduciary'. The fiduciary is expected to manage the assets for the benefit of the other person rather than for his or her own profit, and cannot benefit personally from their management of assets. While a financial advisor is not held to the same high legal standard, and can use your money in sub-optimal ways to make them money while you make less than you could have. I'm curious if medical professionals are held to a similar high legal standard in the U.S.A... svor1988: Oh, I see your other posts and imagery now: https://www.dentistry-forums.com/threads/crowns-or-bonding.22560/I'm sorry you didn't get any help on here then.If the dentin was exposed then I'd advise some sort of treatment. If no dentin was exposed I'd personally not gotten any treatment and just take good care of it (with fluoride products and all):Dentin has a critical pH of 6.7.\nNatural enamel (Hydroxylapatite) has a critical pH of 5.5.\nFluoride treated enamel (Fluorapatite) has a critical pH of 4.5.\nLactic acid has a pH of 3.51.\nSugar & starch in saliva is digested in the mouth by naturally occurring bacteria, and lactic acid is a byproduct of that metabolism found in 4-5 hours.\nLactic acid is primarily what causes cavities.\nDentin is very vulnerable to acids, and its purpose is structural integrity of the tooth. So if the dentin was exposed, it would be in your best interest to have it treated somehow.Survival of posterior crowns is lower than for those on anterior teeth (e.g., 84.4% vs. 94.5% for Empress and 90.4% vs. 94.5% for InCeram) (Pjertursson et al., 2007): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170166/Posterior teeth are the molars & premolars, anterior teeth are your incisors & canines.Temporary tooth eruption isn't that expensive of an issue in my opinion... it should be treated as cementum has pH of 6.0 to 6.7 (cementum is exposed due to the eruption). Can be treated by wearing a mouth guard at night. Though uncomfortable, they are inexpensive and can be found at grocery stores in the pharmacy area. svor1988: Ohhhhh I just noticed another issue looking at your xray, that molar being erupted due to 2 factors:Lack of opposition.\nThe adjacent wisdom tooth impacting it.I believe the mouth-guard treatment will best fix this issue. Your wisdom tooth on the bottom should push forward eventually to fill that space... but your erupted tooth needs to be pushed back into place first by the mouth guard. It is possible that the wisdom tooth will not sheer correctly against the adjacent molar, but I don't expect that outcome if you use the mouth-guard every night. The cheapest option would be to do mouth-guard treatment first by yourself, and if this does not work then seek professional assistance.This is what my intuition tells me. Many dentists will try to convince you to take out your wisdom teeth even if medically unnecessary because of the high insurance payout for each of them. My advice is to keep them, as they may come in useful later in life as you loose other teeth- molars will naturally push forward to fill any gaps.So... now that I think about it, the crown is far better than having dentin exposed. But you're right, bonding may have been a better long term solution in your best interests. A crown could have always been made later if the bonding treatments repeatedly failed."

    "dialogue": "Kev: I brush twice a day and floss but still cant get my teeth clean properly i still end up with soft white stuff on my teeth. So im assuming its my diet.  I eat cornflakes for breakfast and before bed, eat about 5 slices of bread a day, snack on yoghurts and fruit and the odd biscuit. I also only drink tea about 6 cups a day. If anyone could give me some advice if they see the problem with my eating.  Thanks drillfillbill: In my opinion,  you are having a healthy diet and doing everything in maintaining a good dental health. It could be that your brushing technique is not proper and maybe you should start flossing before brushing so that area between two teeth is thoroughly cleaned. This is exactly the area where the white film or tartar tends to accumulate.\nTry checking out some videos on youtube on brushing technique.\ncheers svor1988: Sugar or starch in saliva becomes lactic acid in 4-5 hours due to naturally occuring bacteria in the saliva:\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=LswhAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA278#v=onepage&q=sugar or starch&f=falseLactic acid is what produces cavities in your teeth.Food stuck on your teeth for a short period of time less than 4 hours is not a problem. The most important times to brush your teeth is before bed, and after eating refined, sticky sugary foods. Avoid sticky sugary foods wherever possible (such as sweedish fish candies).Occasionally brushing your teeth or rinsing with flouride based products will promote the change of natural Hydroxylapatite in the enamel to Fluorapatite; Fluorapatite has a critical pH of 4.5 making it more resistant to acid than the natural Hydroxylapatite which has a critical pH of 5.5. Lactic acid has a pH of 3.51. You may remember learning about bases and acids from high school... so I'm sure you can understand this."

Went to another dentist today as I honestly did not get a good vibe from the dentist that did the crown. They did xrays and the tech that did the xray seemed a bit shocked, as well as another person, at what they saw. I asked if they saw something wrong and they said they think so but they would let the doctor talk to me. Well the doctor confirmed that there was piece of the instrument in my tooth and it was not plugging up/sealing a \"hole\"( and oh by the way he did do a root canal) and this was causing drainage and thus an infection. She did say, without me asking anything, \"in the doctors defense\" it was a wicked angle root canal. I did not ask any questions regarding if the doctor did anything wrong but I did get the gut feeling she was not revealing her true feelings. She said the tooth needs to be extracted and I need an implant. I'm going Monday to see the oral surgeon to get the tooth extracted.I'm inquiring here because after the doc left the xray tech and another office person seemed to imply the previous doctor was a bit at fault. The one woman said he should have sent me somewhere to have the piece of instrument removed(which I believe she said was zinc...not sure how she would now). It DEFINTELTY seemed by her reactions that what was done was not right.I'd like to know if anyone can offer advice/input as to whether this doctor was at fault when he did my root canal(which I didn't even know) and because now I'm going to have to pay thousands of dollars and if this was caused by his irresponsibility than I should not have to shell out all this money.

Said it wouldn't need a root canal.Numbed me up, shaved it down pretty good,placed the temporary crown.He said I could have mild to moderate pain afterwards since the nerves were still intact & told me it would be ok to take the vicodin he had prescribed me last week for a tooth extraction (last week he also gave me antibiotics, which I took religiously as prescribed). I forgot to ask him, but how long should I expect on average to feel discomfort?Is it normal for the crown to hurt if I accidently bite down on it since it is new & the tooth is still healing from being shaved down? It has only been a few hrs since the procedure.No gum pain, and I took half of a vicodin & have just a slight throbbing. I accidently bit down on it (not hard) & had a very sharp pain from doing so :/I don't know if it matters, but they were having a hard time getting the impression done; I apparently wasn't biting correctly so they had to try 2 times before getting a successful imprint.Obviously, following a very soft diet (especially since I'm still 6 days post-op from a bottom wisdom tooth extraction on the left side). Tone-Analyst: Not a professional here but,.. shaving off your natural crown was a massive trauma to your tooth. There is no sensitivity in enamel but the dentin part of the tooth has tubules and nerve endings. (Not the actual nerve, called pulp) Shaving off your natural crown must have carved into the dentin and may be sensitive for some time. I would give it 2-3 weeks for sure."

    "dialogue": "Mark Wyndham-Jones: Hi,Can anyone help as I am looking for a dentist who can offer an OPG (Private) without the need for a referral from my NHS dentist.Story goes:\nI booked an appointment with my dentist to acquire a referral to the local dental academy for an OPG (as my dentist does not have the equipment)\nMy dentist refused to offer me a referral on the grounds that he was concerned about the level of radiation an OPG would immit.I have phoned around a few private dentists but none will offer an OPG without a referral.I am now at a loss as to what to do, as the refusal to offer a referral prevents me from further treatment.My reason for an OPG is because I have recently had a denture (Replacing a three piece bridge) top front of mouth, but I am having problems adapting to it (Possible more emotionally the anything else) and am happy to go with a two piece implant bridge or three separate implants (Private naturally as not available on the NHS)My dentist does not offer implants, but has an associate who does.I feel that I am being held to ransom and that my dentist is being somewhat unethical in their refusal to offer a referral.\nI believe the refusal to offer a referral could quite easily affect  the health & condition of my teeth & bone in future years, so why would any dentist be happy with this.My question is, does anyone out there know of a dentist or hospital who can offer an OPG without the need of a referral (UK South East/West and or London area)I want the OPG so I can pass it around a few dentists to get approx implant costs as I do not have a mass of money and need to find the best option out there.\nIt's not all about cost, but when you have very little money it is something that must be considered.Any help and advice gratefully received.Mark TheAmalgamator: OPGs can't be taken without a referral and your dentist can't refer you without good justification. that would be unethical. Implant dentists prefer to take mtheir own xrays and in most case they needCT Scans for treatment planning so I would say find a good implant dentist (ideally based on recommendation) and let them do their own assessment and don't worry about taking the OPG done elsewhere. Hope this helps"

    "dialogue": "Sam Thames: Hey there and thank you for checking out my enquiry!I am absolutly terrified because this is to do with a front tooth and one of my biggest nightmares is losing a front tooth!\nSo basically in 2012 I had two molars extracted due to dental abscesses! I didn't want it to happen and its scarred my confidence deeply. I'm not even sure that extraction was the best method, I mean I had root canals before hand on both teeth but extraction was something I really didn't want.Anyway now I have two small lumps on the inside of my gums; not visible from the outisde, I can only feel them. One of them is above an extracted tooth and a small pimple was formed where the missing tooth was suppose to be. The other, is way up above a FRONT TOOTH! Its close to the nose and it doesn't have any pain, neither of them do. Are these abscesses? I really, really hope not. I have had the worst experiences with abscess and especially losing two teeth because of it. I'm absolutly terrifed and I can't get to the dentist until after the 9th (pay day). I can't lose my front tooth, I can't lose any teeth, I'm so scared and its givng me the worst anxitey I've ever had. The front tooth has a filling on it that was done many years ago. There is no pain in my teeth at all, my front tooth feels a little odd but I'm not sure if thats where I've been playing with my tooth and gums above it out of anxiety.Please give me insight and help me calm down. I really, really can't lose my front tooth, it will affect my entire life from career to love life. Like I said I've has the worst luck with teeth and it's killing me. Please help me!\nThank you so much for listening and a massive thank you in advance <3 TheAmalgamator: the pimple high above the front tooth could be a sign of chronic infection in the tooth. Treatment options are to leave it (but there is a risk of acute infection/ pain and swelling)/ root canal treatment to remove the infected nerve/ extraction of the tooth. root canal treatment would be the best option to save the tooth. \nthe lump above the extracted tooth socket could be a piece of bone. generally nothing to worry about unless its very painful and in that case it can be smoothed out under local injection.\nHope this helps"

    "dialogue": "candr: I watched this video on youtube : \nIt must be very diffucult procedure! I am really scared about this.There are some informations on internet that this surgery casuses lots of pain?\nis this really true?\nBest Regards zeezee22: I had apicectomy 5 weeks ago done by an oral surgeon.  The surgeon was very skilled and he was also a qualified medical doctor as well as a specialist oral surgeon.  The procedure was done under local anaesthetic and during the procedure there was no pain at all.  Following the procedure it is is important to follow instructions and keep your mouth very clean so healing can complete.  The next 2-3 days after surgery there will be swelling as your body heals, but this goes away and all swelling had gone down by day 6 and healing continued with me.  The surgery is totally painless under local anaesthetic and the surgeon took about 45 minutes to complete the surgery. I would say, get someone to go with you, as you will not feel like driving afterwards and you need to rest after surgery.  However, if you need to have the procedure done, then do not feel worried, it is no more traumatic than having a filling.  The only thing I will say is that I had dissolvable stitches, but they did not dissolve and I had to go back and have them removed.   Again this did not hurt at all.  So the only thing I would say is get a good surgeon to do the work, one who is very experienced and the procedure itself will not be a problem."

    "dialogue": "Yeroc: Hello,Within the past couple year I switched to a new dentist due to moving. Prior to coming to the dentist I'm currently at I hadn't had a cavity in years. Within the past two years with my new/current dentist I've been told twice now that I have a very very small pit that is considered a cavity in my back molars. The first time I was nieve and got it filled.  This second time happened today. I couldn't believe it with my oral hygiene habits and feeling no pain I was shocked.  What I want to know is if I'm getting scammed by a dentist that's drill happy. I've done some research online and this seems to be a debate topic in the dental community whether to drill early or not. From research I've read that these micro pits \"cavities\" are better off not filled and could take many years to develop into an actual full on cavity. Or they may never get any worse or even completely heal. Other side of the argument obviously says you need to fill a cavity is a cavity.  I wanted an actual opinion from someone with a background in the field on their opinion. Background info I'm in my 20s and brush twice a day and floss everyday sometimes multiple times a day.

Would they use Veneers or maybe even crowns? \nI am not in pain, and I eat normally jameslehman694: I think you should go with the crowns treatment and it cost you around $500-$2,000 per tooth. The crowns treatment requires a shot in the gums of lidocaine or another local anesthetic. After the procedure is over and the anesthesia has worn off, the patient may feel some sensitivity with the temporary crown or some soreness in the gums around the tooth. The pain is very minimal though and shouldn't last long."

    "title": "Waiting for root canal, pain control and risks",
    "dialogue": "BAT: A quick overview:  During 2015, I was pregnant.  My teeth were fine before with only few cavities here and there which I always had fixed.  Due to severe acid reflux, vomiting, and out of control pregnancy hormones, I suffered significant tooth decay during the pregnancy.  I now have multiple cavities in every tooth except my front teeth.  In the beginning of 2016 after giving birth, I went to a new dentist (due to insurance reasons) and had the cavities on the upper left side of my mouth filled and one crown put in.  This exhausted all of my dental insurance benefits for the year.  I was told I needed a root canal on my upper left back molar.  I opted to have this tooth extracted instead to save money, since I was already burdened with the enormous out-of-pocket cost of my recent childbirth. Immediately after the extraction of the upper left back molar and the extensive fillings that were done in the remaining tooth next to it, I began to experience sensitivity and pain in this particular tooth, which is now my only remaining back left molar.  This tooth had cracked and the filling broke while the dentist was working on it, so he had to redo the filling.  I also ended up with a very large bone spur protruding out of my gum and into my cheek at the extraction site.  The extraction hole had to be reopened and the large fragment of bone was cut out through it.  The extraction healed, but over the next several months, the pain in the remaining upper left back molar increased until it became unbearable.  I went to a different dentist, who confirmed my suspicion that the first dentist did not do a very good job and the fillings he did do will eventually need to be replaced.  I have actually had one of these fillings fall right out of a different tooth since then, and quite a bit of pain in these teeth, so Dentist #2 is right.  I am left with a mouthful of unfilled cavities, a few poorly filled cavities that need to be redone, unbearable agony in my remaining upper left back molar, and no more dental insurance benefits left for 2016.  Dentist #2 was very understanding and has been trying to help me hold over until 2017, when I will have insurance benefits again.  He did a procedure (a partial pulpectomy, I think) where he drilled into the tooth, cut out some of the dying pulp to give the dying nerve and pulp more room to swell to help with the pain, flushed it, pumped in antibiotics, and closed it back up.  This only cost me $50.  After he did this, the pain went from a 10 to a 2.  After a few more months, though, the pain crept back up and a horrible smell began to emit from this tooth.  I went back to the dentist and he repeated the procedure, which diminished the pain and eliminated the smell.  He said if it continues, he won't be able to keep repeating the procedure and I will need to do the root canal.  The point of all this is to save the tooth, since it's my only remaining molar on the upper left side, so I can hopefully be able to chew on that side again someday.Now, it is almost December.  I have one month left before my dental benefits renew at the start of 2017.  Overnight, the pain in my tooth went from a 2 back to a 10 and beyond.  It is worse than it was the first and second time, and almost unlivable.  I do have credit cards and I know about Care Credit, but my credit cards are already run up and it's Christmastime on top of that.  I have waited and suffered all year trying to make it to 2017, and it would be a shame to have made it this far only to give in and pay the full cost of the root canal myself, when if I can just hold on one more month, I will be able to pay only $1,000 with insurance.  Lacking dental and medical knowledge, I am trying to decide what I can do to mitigate the pain and risk of waiting another month for the root canal.  I have been taking 400mg of Tylenol about 3-4 times per day.  Ibuprofen doesn't seem to help.  I had an unrelated blood test (for hypothyroidism) and my liver markers came back very elevated, probably due to the Tylenol.  I am also still breastfeeding the baby who refuses to wean, so I have to take that into consideration as well.  Is it safe for me to take this much Tylenol for a full month plus, and by doing so, am I putting my liver/kidneys/stomach/thyroid at risk?  Breastfeeding is probably a bad idea, too, I assume.  Are there any ideas I can try other than pain medicine to deal with the pain?  I just need to survive one month and then I can finally get the root canal.  Thank you."

Thanks in advance..Dr. Huang. snaggletooth: As an older person, I've noticed that doctors nowadays, have neither the time nor the interest to really listen to their patients, What used to be considered a good bedside manner has gone the way of the Dodo. Doctors have too many patients to have the patience it requires to adequately attend to their needs. paula ggibson: I would like to understand why the cost of Dentistry is so expensive in the U.S. I simply cannot afford to have any work done. svor1988: I have tons of dentists in my area. One said the dentist market here was over-saturated.For me having the cash cost of procedures listed on their web site is a big plus. Being low cost is most important to me. Reviews are important.Being upfront about what they bill for and how much before they provide whatever service. Once he asked me if I had any questions. I asked about pain in my palate due to another dentist's dental implant- he charged me $30 for his response talking about stem cell healing he learned about at a convention... I never should have paid that. I never went back though. Good riddance. Dr. Peterson Huang: Thank you for the questions! I really appreciate the feedback. As I mentioned before, I am always looking to better my practice, and questions like these are a help to that effect.In response to:\nsnaggletooth - I agree that medical professionals are busy and getting busier, and this reflects in time spent with patients, and in some cases, the quality of those interactions can go down. Whether this is due to changes with regard to insurance (as is stated in articles and forums elsewhere, offline) I am not sure. What I do know is that I strive to keep this concern in mind when attending to my clients. Asking questions, and listening to answers, is a first step, and this extends outwards from the dentist/ doctor, to everyone that the client interacts with while in my office.\npaula ggibson - This is a question with a complex answer, and I appreciate you asking it. The cost of dental procedures does seem to vary, and is expensive, relative to other countries. I do not claim to be an expert in the area of relative dental costs; however, the many individual units in the chain of dental care - from salaries, to rent for offices, to insurance, and specialized machinery (for example, machines t omake custom milled crowns, in-house)- do add up and are expensive. That said, costs do vary, and I always recommend that prior to a procedure, interview different dental practices and ask questions. Be sure to ask about insurance and any financing options that they may provide. I hope that this helps!\nsvor1988 - Thank you for your response. I agree that reviews are important.\nAlthough I see points both for and against listing costs on a website - not having such costs listed can encourage someone to call in and have their questions answered while making options for them easier to create- I agree wholeheartedly about being up front about costs prior to a procedure being done. Transparency with regard to how much the total will be, and how much would be covered by that particular insurance, is good for everyone involved. I hope you found another dental office more to your liking.Thank you again, everyone, for your replies. And please keep more coming.Dr. Huang,\nhttps://novapremierdental.com/"

I noticed a couple things that were different from my previous experiences. \n1. I had a new dentist and assistant that I hadn't seen before.\n2. They administered it differently. This time they I had one of the partner dentists and they only turned the gas on when he was in the room. So it started about the time he gave the numbing shot which didn't help much. \n3. They asked me a couple times, if I could feel the gas (I think they could tell I was anxious) and I said no so they said they were going to turn it up. At the end they said it was as high as they were allowed to go. \n4. The appointment took 1.5 hours. The assistant even commented on how the dentist was very thorough.\n5. They did stop during each filling to give me an extra numbing shot because it was still painful.When I went to stand up after they were done, I almost fell over and the assistant caught my arm and told me to sit down and gave me some more oxygen. It wasn't really a bad experience, just a little embarrassing and I was wondering if I maybe had to much gas? Maybe a bad batch? Something else?"

    "title": "dentists pointing out decay that really isn't",
    "dialogue": "december: Husband took 7 year old son to the dentist who diagnosed him with a couple of cavities.  Dentist showed my husband where these cavities were, on the tops of two of his molars, and my husband said he could see what the dentist was talking about, but then when he tried to show me, neither one of us could find them.  I decided to take him for a second opinion.  As soon as dentist #2 found out who dentist #1 was, she acted like I was doing something wrong bringing him in for a second opinion and kept raving about how dentist #1 was the best dentist in the area.  She checked my son's mouth, looked confused, looked at the X rays dentist #1 had done, still was confused, so she did her own X rays and then diagnosed with my son with an additional bunch of cavities on top of the ones that dentist #1 had found.  Once she saw the X rays then she could point out where the cavities were to me, which were areas that were just slightly a different shade of white.  I was so skeptical about the whole thing because how bad of cavities could they be if they could only be seen once you know what to look for on an X ray?  Not to mention just her whole attitude of how dare you question dentist #1 made me feel like she had some other agenda than giving an honest 2nd opinion.So I was paralyzed with indecision for a few months trying to decide what to do when I learned about silver diamine fluoride and decided surely this was the solution!  So I asked dentist #1 about using it and he said it would be unlikely to work because my son's cavities were all in between his teeth.  What??  He had never said anything about the cavities being in between the teeth before, so I decided this dentist could not be trusted, if he was changing the story now.  I took all my kids to dentist #3 and didn't mention anything about a second opinion, just acted like it was a regular check up.  Dentist #3 diagnosed my son with multiple cavities in between his teeth.  Said that his teeth looked perfect just looking inside his mouth, but that there was decay in between the teeth that couldn't be seen except on an X Ray.  So it corroborates exactly with what Dentist #1 put in my son's dental chart but not at all with what we were verbally told. So my question is why did I have two dentists physically pointing out decay to us when none of the decay can visually be seen?  Why didn't they just say what Dentist #3 did, that the decay was all between the teeth? december: My second question would be is it common to have no tooth pain, but need a pulpotomy?  That is what dentist #3 is recommending.  She seems trustworthy and I really don't want to go get a fourth opinion because that's getting really excessive, but it is nagging at me that my son has absolutely no pain or any other issues with his teeth, yet supposedly the pulp is affected? How does that work? svor1988: Dental professionals in my area seemed to have each others back as well. My best interests were always beneath theirs and these professionals kept me in the dark about my best interests.Though it does sound like the 2 independent dentists found something. I'm no dentist, hopefully somebody else answers here.The cavity had reached the pulp? If not, try a different diet. Make sure he's really brushing (soft bristles) and rinsing hard too... not just spitting out the toothpaste whole (like I did when I was young because I hated the taste, I'd just pretend when mother was around).I take it this is a permanent tooth? Seems odd that there is a cavity this soon.I'm skeptical of silver diamine fluoride. Yes silver has an antibacterial effect, and fluoride makes a nice chemically inert barrier (e.g. teflon)- but I'm concerned about unknown chemistry, ingestion/adsorbtion, and unknown interactions with the body (including possible immune reactions which can affect one person but not the next).I've had luck with bacterial treatments for reversing and removing superficial decay: http://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6831-10-18 Way better than a dentist drill permanently removing the affected enamel... svor1988: *fluorine makes a nice chemically inert barrierFluorine was the appropriate word to use there, not fluoride. Plaza Dental Group: As far as your question is concerned, in my opinion sometimes a dentist can tell you have a cavity just by looking in your mouth. There are many ways that a dentist can detect a cavity. Your dentist may question your overall oral health, and will examine your teeth for any soft spots or sensitivity while using dental instruments. X-rays are also helpful in determining the seriousness of a cavity. The dentist looks at your tooth to see if there are any weaknesses, usually a brown spot or some other sort of abnormality. If your dentist uses magnification, that is VERY helpful in differentiating between decay and stains. You can help prevent cavities by regularly visiting the dentist, brushing twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and cleaning daily between your teeth with dental floss."

    "dialogue": "janeharper: My mother has only 2-3 teeth in the back of her mouth. I am preparing to help pay for new teeth for her in Jan 2017. Would she get dentures? She is 69 years old and has borderline type 2 diabetes. If I find a good dentist I'm also trying to sign her up for a good dental plan/insurance in Oklahoma. I don't know if you need new teeth at that age, are they dentures or, something else. Fesenko Nikas: Seek for the competent doctor, as not every dentist knows, for example, that pain sensitivity is increased among people with diabetes, they will quickly become fatigued, and they have reduced immunity. And the choice of the type of dental care and the materials require special knowledge.\nProsthodontists often make mistakes, choosing the design of dentures for the patient with diabetes. They underestimate (or overestimate) gum health in diabetics. Each patient is recommended to remember that it is necessary to postpone the orthopedic treatment of the disease if the blood sugar level is heightened until the compensation or, particularly, it is wrong to refuse in treatment. In such cases, treatment should be limited to the manufacture of dental prostheses that meet the requirements for proper redistribution of the load.\nDentists for teeth prosthetics use structural materials. Most of them are different metal alloys. But the presence of metal alloys in the mouth is a source of trace elements to the body. In addition, metal compounds in the oral cavity, affect the quality and quantity of saliva, and its enzyme activity, and can provoke allergic reactions. In this regard, patients with diabetes cannot be provided with dentures and crowns made of cobalt-chromium and nickel-chromium alloys which are widely used in prosthetics. Only gold-platinum alloy can be used for crowns and bridges (but it's very expensive!), and dentures must have titanium base. It prevents mouth the fungus genus Candida, multiplication of staphylococci."

    "dialogue": "Tanman: 18 year old male tooth extracted on feb 2016 looking for advice based on ct scans and report provided below. Also can some one explain what the report is saying. svor1988: It is a cone beam ct scan. All they're doing is measuring the bone to select an appropriate sized titanium screw for your planned implant. If the screw is too wide the bone would fail, if the screw is too long it would go into your nose, if the screw is too small you could face failure due to the use of the tooth. You will loose some bone after the placement as well, hopefully not too much. Around my implants the bone is now concave.The cone-beam ct scan is a sign of competency to me. Mine used x-rays. They make sure they won't hit a nerve or anything either. Some people have had permanent numbness in their mouth due to implant placement hitting a nerve (or even being close).You're 18 years old? I got suckered into an implant right after I turned 18 as well. One of the worst mistakes of my life. If you're serious, wait till you're 4 years older and through college is my advice. Also, do a google search for the life expectancy of dental implants- you should see 30 years tops. It is not life-long.Even if all goes well with the implant, with the bone loss, there may not be enough bone to replace the implant when it eventually fails.I lost a perfectly good molar due to this implant. And my implant turned out not safe to chew on due to faulty placement. It is cosmetic. That is all it is.In sales pitches I've seen it said that titanium is inert. I've seen research online saying some people (<4%) do have allergic reactions, and should get a titanium allergy test done prior to such a permanent and invasive placement.Spend that money on pizza instead. And wait till dental science improves.Kudos to you for doing some research online first. And make sure you get another opinion!P.S. A few year down your road if your wisdom teeth are coming in strait, you don't need them removed. They can come in handy decades later as replacement molars (your molars naturally scoot forward to fill gaps). Your dentist may still pressure you to remove them to get whatever your parent's insurance company pays for that service. Tanman: If you lose bone cant you do a bone graft to build it stronger. I cant imagine another 4 years with a dental flipper, the most annoying thing iv ever experienced. And if you wait dont u just keep losing more bone in the area svor1988: Tanman said:\t\t\tIf you lose bone cant you do a bone graft to build it stronger.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...If you want to pay for that possibility. I no longer want to be treated like a human Frankenstein personally.This chap did just what you asked about twice, look how he turned out: https://www.dentistry-forums.com/threads/implants-bone-grafts.22112/After my experience with implants, I only advocate for life saving surgical work. Cosmetic surgical work I strongly advise against.Ask your doctor if he can sew it back to the underlying tissue. If so disconnected for too long it will likely die due to lack of blood.Tanman said:\t\t\tAnd if you wait dont u just keep losing more bone in the area\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Hmmmm I don't have any literature observations here to give a good answer. The space my socket is now didn't fill up with bone, adjacent to it is a cliff of bone. Seems in better shape there then the bone next to my implants. My impression is that somehow the titanium implant causes bone loss. Good research project I guess, but I need to go run an errand now. Plaza Dental Group: You will need to have the tooth extracted or pulled, and then have a dental implant surgically placed. In my practice, I will take a 3-D image of your mouth. The image will show the intricate details of your bone structure, teeth, and gums. I plan the implant placement using guided implant surgery technology that ensures the most comfortable and natural fit."

    "title": "NHS Dentists Have Ruined My Teeth",
    "dialogue": "Nuluvius: I'm currently suffering with both of my upper right premolars which are badly broken and literally rotting in my mouth thanks to the handy work of two NHS dental practices, which in the space of a year have between themselves managed to completely ruine my teeth.I originally went to the first dental practice following the fillings dropping out of both teeth. The treatment plan devised at the time was for both teeth to be root cancelled and then crowned (band two NHS). The root canal was completed and temporary fillings placed. However I was promptly deregistered after having to cancel an appointment on short notice due to sick children. I then had to wait over four months to see another dentist by which time the temporary fillings that the first dentist put in had degraded and fallen out leaving me with exposed root cavities which became infected.The second dentist that I saw informed me that the first dentist was simply trying to make money off of me and that I only needed both teeth to have the root canals repeated and then filled (band one NHS). I’d agreed to this course of treatment on the principle that this dentist seemed honest and reputable. However the fillings continued to fall out over the course of the next few months, they must have refilled the teeth around five times per tooth, each time more and more of the original tooth was destroyed until my second premolar had completely shattered and sheared right off at the gum line. Following this my first premolar became reinfected yet again i.e. the second root canal had failed and I had an acute infection around the apex of one of the roots. The dentist treated this with medicated dressings which also continued to fall out.I'd simply had enough of this and decided to go to a third dentist which I had to wait another month to see. This one was highly recommended by family, friends and colleagues. However upon arriving I was made to wait one hour and twenty minutes for the appointment. When finally meeting the dentist he was rude, arrogant and patronising. Upon concluding a very heavy handed examination he thrust a pamphlet at me detailing private fees and proceed to try to coerce me into paying them.The gist of his 'advice' was that I'd waste my time with the NHS treatment as they would choose substandard materials and techniques which would ultimately fail. He tried to hard sell me on either private root canal therapy followed by private crowns or 'for a better foundation' as he put it, private implants; all carried out within their group practice/s of course! Needless to say that I walked out and refused to pay the £35 XRay fee and the £20 'checkup' fee they tried to demand...At this point I am sitting here despairing, as mentioned previously, literally with a mouthful of broken and rotting teeth. Moreover I have no clear plan on what to do next. It occurs to me that NHS dentists are either not capable of undertaking the work or they simply don't want to due to the potential cost based on risk of failures.I cannot afford to pay thousands for the treatment yet equally so I cannot afford to loose the teeth due to them being a highly visible part of my smile line.So far I have raised all of this to the GDC and the NHS. The GDC didn't want to know unless the NHS escalated a case up to them and the NHS have a very slow turnaround time apparently; and time is most definitely not a factor that is on my side with this kind of problem.Unfortunately there are no dental universities in my region or in the immediate vicinity of it and moreover they traditionally have a long turnaround time and compounding eligibility criteria.I am wondering if there is anything that I am missing/not aware of that I can be proactively doing right now? What advice can you offer me? Should I simply find a fourth dentist to pull the teeth and then try to manage the physiological and professional implications before sepsis occurs...I honestly find it incredible that in this day and age and especially in the west that one can be left in such a state... Nikolai Fesenko: I would recommend not to give up the search for a good dentist. Look for your local forums, read reviews concerning doctors, and then choose whom to go to an appointment. If you really liked the doctor, ask the contacts, so next time you do not have such a problem!Good luck"

You can have a maximum of 1000mg of paracetamol every 4 hours and no more than 4000mg in 24 hours. And with Ibuprofen a maximum of 400mg every 6 hours and no more that 1200mg in 24 hours.

However, I am a mouth breather and upon reflection, I realized I have an oral fixation with chewing on pens at work during the day.  Could chewing on pens produce the same sort of results that would mimic grinding my teeth?I tried a mouth guard but it will not stay in and makes it very hard to fall asleep.Any advice would be appreciated.Thanks!\nChris in NEPA svor1988: Grinding teeth is a common medication side effect. Taking any anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medication? If so, look up their side effects, and if it is the drug then change the treatment, or do no drugs at all.No I don't think chewing on pens would produce the same result. One friend lost a lot of teeth due to night grinding and not routinely wearing his mouth guard. I don't think the momentary benefit of said drugs are worth your teeth. Nikolai Fesenko: I had the same problem, I took a course of a sedative drug, a vascular drug, and then I stopped to grind my teeth at night. Consult your neurologist, very often it is a nervous problem"

Plaza Dental Group: As a specialist, I would like to tell you it does happen, but more often with general dentist.  Don't fear. Most oral surgeons are skilled in dealing with this situation. Perhaps an X-ray might help in giving us a better idea however; I'd request you to stick to ANY ONE dentist for the treatment. If you have a broken tooth, see your dentist as soon as possible. Your dentist can figure out if the break was caused by a cavity, and if the tooth's nerve is in danger. A damaged nerve usually will require root canal treatment. A root canal treatment is not supported as the tooth is usually not accessible by the operator, and the anatomy of the root is highly unpredictable, which makes it difficult to give a predictable result after root canal treatment. In the following cases I would highly recommend extraction, a tooth with no functioning opposing, i.e. the opposing tooth is missing or you don't need it for eating. Also if the all your other teeth are sound you could extract it and take good care of more important ones."

However, I realised that my dentist (do note not a orthodontist) has not made any major improvements to the overall aesthetics of my teeth. I am not sure if i'm being paranoid or do I have an issue to be worried about. My concerns are as follows:(a) my central incisor has been rotated about 10 degrees ever since January and nothing has been done to fix that. My dentist placed a wire with a metal band (instead of a normal rubber band) to fasten it to the wire. However, nothing has significantly changed. Do I need to be worried or is there something that I can advice her to do about it?(b) I was naturally born without a lateral incisor as seen in the attached photos. However, my current dentist proposed closing the original gaps that I have (which is my current state) and to insert in a resin-bonded bridge to the adjacent teeth. However, I have my own reservations about that (i.e. natural discolourations and the possibility of the teeth looking fake or too small). Even an implant is definitey off the list because the space is too small, and I have insufficient dental bone at that specific area. I actually went to seek a second opinion and the dentist there told me that my best method for moving forward is to seek a orthodontist, which would most likely suggest to me extracting 2 pre-molars on the upper and possibly none or 1 on the bottom, and use braces to close the gaps without the need to have a bridge/implant. I am currently extremely confused and lost as to what to do and I hope I could get some help here.Thanks. PlacidWay-US: In your case I really suggest you seek for a second opinion and on an orthodontist. Based on what you said your teeth is really messed up and that Gap is really noticeable. You should look for qualified orthodontist, some general dentist can refer you to an orthodontist but now ask more details. You should know and ask what will be the outcome of the procedure they will be doing and what are risks. Good luck to you."

    "title": "Low Filling Question",
    "dialogue": "Gary: I have not had a tooth filled for over 13 years until yesterday when I had two teeth filled.  In the past the dentist always filled up the inside cavity of the tooth until the top of the cavity was almost flush with the surrounding tooth.  Yesterday the dentist filled the two teeth but I noticed he left a a sizable valley on top of the filling.  Is this something new?  Does it have something to do with putting pressure on the sounding tooth?  Was the dentist correct in doing this?  Will food get stuck in the valley of the tooth?  Thank you for your help. Plaza Dental Group: As  specialized in this filed, I would say that you should go to the dentist for checking  the vitality status of the nerve - sometimes when you have a large cavity or filling, the tooth (nerve) may die over time and you will have a lot of discomfort when you chew - if this is the case, you need a root canal. If you are hitting the filling incorrectly, it will prolong the sensitivity. Also, your nerve may have been affected by the depth of the restoration. Finally, sometimes when a filling is very deep, it irritates the nerve of the tooth and if this does not go away over 2 weeks to a month it is probably time for a root canal.  Next step is to go back to your dentist ASAP.  Good Luck."

Problem is I go on holiday tomorrow for a week! What's the best thing to do? Can't get into the emergency dentist! By the way in no pain at all! Rabbit: That one is not good because the tooth may spoil fast especially when biting hard substances. You may end up with extraction if not repaired immediately, so the best option is to see the most available Dentist to fix that. It only takes short time and you will get the best advice after examination to assess the extent of damage- so go on and visit the Dentist next door soonest. Plaza Dental Group: As a specialist, I would like to tell you that Dental mishaps and emergencies happen every day and obviously it is important to contact your dentist immediately if you have sudden severe pain, a swollen face, swollen gums, a loose tooth, or tender gums—as these are signs of an infection or an acute abscess.  If you just broke off a significant portion of your tooth and if the tooth has a large filling, there’s a good chance the filling is secure. If the tooth fragment has broken off completely, the initial pain will often fade and you can continue your meal remembering to avoid cold, sweets and extreme heat. If the tooth breaks and your dangling cusp is being held in by your gum, go to the restroom with your ice water. Place a piece of ice against the gum where the tooth is loose for 30 seconds, being careful not to put the ice directly on the tooth. Your gum will be numb enough that you will be able to gently and painlessly remove the loose broken piece of tooth dangling by a thread (like a baby tooth that’s ready to go). If your gum bleeds a bit, bite on a tissue or paper towel for a few minutes and the bleeding should stop."

I think I should go for an xray or something. Somebody there has an answer to this- shoot before it grows taller than its brothers! Plaza Dental Group: As per your description can be a possibility of the decay reaching pulp/ nerve endings thereby giving rise to sharp pain at times. In such cases any contact with hot/cold food/beverages also gives rise to sharp pain. A tooth which hurts when exposed to cold for a longer period of time(say more than 15 seconds) or hot, is a classical symptom of pulp involvement. Your best course of action will be to seek a dentist’s advice as soon as possible who can decide the treatment plan after taking an x-ray of the involved tooth. Avoid eating, hot, spicy and hard food. Don’t brush hard or chew hard foods from that area.Keep that area as clean as possible. Try using special toothpastes instead of normal tooth pastes called sensitivity toothpaste. Use it daily with warm water (don’t use hot water) to brush your teeth. These tooth pastes contain special components which block the dentinal tubules (on teeth) that cause pain and provide relief.I hope this helps!"

    "title": "Pain After Broken Tooth Filled",
    "dialogue": "pjbren: Hi Everyone,There's a bit of history to this question: I had pain in a lower molar when chewing on certain foods for about 2 years. The pain became progressively worse, and I saw 2 dentists in attempt to find the cause. They guessed it could be a small crack in the tooth, but were unable to replicate the pain by doing various tests. The pain started to get quite a bit worse about 2 months ago. I saw an endodontist who was able to replicate the pain and determine which tooth had the crack (tooth #30). He recommended seeing my dentist and having either a full crown on onlay put on the tooth to hopefully fix the pain issue without need for a root canal. I made an appointment with my dentist, but just a few days before my appointment, my tooth broke while I was eating.  Pretty amazing timing considering I'd had the crack for about 2 years! It wasn't a huge break, basically a part of a cusp fractured off. I saw the dentist the next day, and she said she could try to restore the broken area with a filling. We made an appointment for the next week.While the tooth was broken, it was less sensitive to chew on, but if I touched inside the broken area, even with my tongue in the right spot, there was a very sensitive pain. The dentist had taken an x-ray and saw no decay or inflammation, but the fractured off area looked like it was pretty close to the pulp.After having the (composite) filling placed last week, I am very discouraged to find that I again have regular pain when chewing food with that tooth, enough so to cause me to only chew on the other side of my mouth. It's not as severe of a sharp pain as before the cracked piece broke off, but it actually happens more easily (less force needs to be applied to cause the pain). The dentist said that the tooth would likely be sensitive for a month or more, but this seems like more than post-operative sensitivity. It's not actually sensitive to cold or hot at all, only the pressure. Even just pressing lightly on the filling area with my finger causes pain.I guess my question is: what seems the most likely cause of this continued (but different) pain? Is there another hairline crack extending through part of the tooth (maybe a continuation of the crack that caused the cusp fracture, or a separate crack)? Is the composite filling pressing on a sensitive, thin layer of dentin above the nerve and transmitting pain when pressure is applied? Maybe the filling wasn't well placed?It's seeming like a full crown is probably going to be needed to get this tooth to stop hurting during chewing. I was actually glad when the cusp broke off because I figured that was a good way for the crack to reveal itself, and that maybe a filling would be enough, but it seems like there is still a problem.Thank you in advance for any input, similar experiences, or advice!"

The rooted tooth LL1 is sited three teeth away from the one one causing the trouble, which is LL3 and the dentist had a hunch that it was LL1 causing the ache because it was the only one nearby with a very small filling.

Because I am an NHS patient I have been waiting a very long time just for an appointment to see a dentist in the Birmingham Dental Hospital.\nDue to its distant location from the troublesome tooth, is it likely that the rooted tooth was the cause of mild intermittent ache, or was the root unnecsessary."

Im in my early 30s and have already a education in computer science but I feel that I want to do more in a practical field,, I would love to be in meds because I love science so I have been thinking about being a dental nurse (dentist is too long education for me and too hard also). I am a person that changing my mind alot, I get  easily bored and constantly want to do things, waiting is something thats hard for me. Rolling my thumbs is something that makes my feel really anxious on work so thats impossible, I rather be unemployed then bored. \nI would LOVE to know what type of person fits as a dental nurse and what type of person that doesnt´? Im very close to say yes to the education but would love to hear first of all some thought about this.Im a bit Adhd/aspergers person, what I mean is that I need alot of stimulation for my brain even if Im calm on the outside. I can focus really good when Im interested in something and put all my time on it but also get frustrated when Im bored. Nobody see my inner frustration but I can feel it and thats almost the only reason why I quit jobs (frustration and boredom)I can see blood without feeling bad, I have no problem with disgusting things like pukes or other things other think is too much but I cant handle skin diseases (rare conditions when the skin falling off, thats the worse) and I suffer from trypophobia. I can look at pictures of  trypophobia (many of these are just fakes) but real once I think I could never handle, my brain get too overwhelmed and I feel dizzy. Sarafbt: Hi. \nI'm a practice manager and for me a dental nurse has to have the following qualities along side the education:\nEnthusiasm, compassionate, kind, great listening skills, accuracy, fast working, sincerity, hard working, flexible towards working hours, can do attitude, ability to work with everyone, and a positive outlook on life. Nursing is a challenging (and sometimes thankless) job. The patients need to trust you, and will often ask you about treatment plans after the dentist has finished (patents see you as more human than the dentist!) The dentist rely on you to be quick and accurate when in surgery and you have to be organised and able to plan ahead. You'll have to be able to handle all different personalities,  from difficult and terrified patients to colleagues that are focused and driven to the down right rude people. You liase between dentists and reception - so being part diplomat helps too! Its a challenging position in the practice but a great nurse is worth her weight in gold!"

    "dialogue": "Andresc: hello everyone,Our nightmare started a year ago. We went to the dentist they found cavities in two of her upper molars..\nThe pediatric dentist told us they would like to do a pulpotomy and put crowns on both, this happen in January.\nFast foward to May, my daughter started to complain about toothache (complain as irritable, cranky) so we decided to take her back to the dentist they told us they didn't see signs of infection, but to make sure they wanted to prescribe Amox.We did that for a week. The pain was still present since she was still bitting down, and cranky at times. The dentist was hesitant and she said to wait it out see whay happens, happens two days later my daughters gum around one of the molars was completely swollen, you could barely see the crown at this point. I called them, they said there was nothing else they could do we took her to the Emergency room and well they had to papoose her and giver her a sedative, the tooth was infected and so they extracted it.It has been almost 3 weeks since this happen, but for some odd reason my daughter keeps bitting down like it hurts her, there has been times she says it hurts..\nWe took her back to the dentist they said her gum was healing, nothing to worry about, they also said she had no cavities..But im worried about the fact the gets cranky at times, and keeps bitting down like something is painful in there.I guess my question is: is this normal? Is the recovery painful? What else could it be?\nI'm sorry for how long this post is, thank you for reading. Zuri Barniv: You need to go back to (probably a different) pediatric dentist to have a look. But after an extraction it can take about 2 weeks before the gums heal, so since it has been 3 weeks, you need to have it looked at. You also can't take out the baby molars and then do nothing, because nearby teeth will tip into that new space and prevent the adult tooth from coming out. You need something called \"space maintainers\", so again, you need to go find another pediatric dentist to help you.

When we took her they told us, everything was fine i asked them if there was anything else to be done as far as the extraction site and they never mentioned a spacer, so yes I'm going to look into another dentist.\nAlso she says it hurts, today again i took a look and the hole seems smaller but still open, is that normal? Thank You Plaza Dental Group: Your daughter is much too young to have these problems. It sounds like she and her parents would benefit from being instructed by the dentist on how to care for her teeth. Eating habits and food choices may also be involved. Pain is not a reliable indicator of anything. The best method for dealing with controversial recommendations is to simply get a 2nd or 3rd opinions from other dentists. She needs to see a pediatric dentist for treatment. It may be worthwhile to investigate the possibility of using a dental sealant on her remaining healthy teeth."

    "title": "Crown/Root canal question",
    "dialogue": "aroundteeth: Hello,I've been having pain/swelling on a tooth the past few days that has a crown. This also happened about 5 months ago but after I saw the dentist (who recommended a root canal) the pain subsided so I put it off. I had the crown put on about a year and half ago. I don't remember the reason but apparently I had a cavity and too much of the tooth was gone to fill. My question is, should the dentist have done the root canal back then before he did the crown? The reason I ask is because now I'm going to have to get rid of a perfectly new crown (well, it wasn't perfect, I still had pain sometimes when eating hard foods) and now have to buy a new one. Thoughts? Thanks Dr David Lee: Hi aroundteeth,Sorry to hear about your situation. Let me see if I can shine some light on it based on the information that you gave me.When there is a large cavity, we have to remove the cavity before proceeding with restoring the tooth with either a filling or a crown (for bigger cavities). At the time of removing the cavity, we may not see the pulp (nerve) of the tooth exposed, which is a good sign. However, it is possible for a root canal to be necessary in the future, since the cavity was NEAR the nerve. This could happen at any time, and is unpredictable.If the cavity is close to the nerve, you could preemptively do a root canal, but most people would opt to not do this and take their chances. Most of the time, a root canal can be performed through the crown, and the access hole can be filled with a filling. Therefore, a new crown is often not necessary.Hope that helps and answers your question!"

    "title": "Do people with a chipped/filled tooth have to eat very, very carefully?",
    "dialogue": "ForMe: Two months ago, I chipped my front incissor tooth.  Obviously visible.  The dentist smoothed it, but I felt self-conscious about smiling or talking to others.  It looked bad.  After three weeks, I went back to the dentist and asked that it be filled.The dentist warned me that a resin filling would break off if I chewed on it or bit food with it (because the filling would be thin).  Also, it's considered a cosmetic procedure so my dental insurance wouldn't cover it.  Several hundred dollars paid upfront.  If it breaks again, then I would have to pay all over to have it re-filled.  I signed that disclosure and then the dentist filled the chipped tooth.  Tooth looks good now, and I'm confidently smiling and laughing again.Except, now I can't eat in front of anyone.  Because I can't use my front incissor teeth,  I have to cut up my food into bite-sized pieces to place under the molars by the cheek.  No more am I able to eat foods by hand - like pizza, burritos, apples, bagels, sandwiches, etc.  I have to place pieces of food in my cheek area with a fork.   And when I'm chewing, I look like an olden-day baseball player with a cheek full of chewing tobacco. Big effort to eat, and embarrassing to have others see it.  I look weird eating a slice of thin crust pizza with a fork & knife!Do others who have chipped & filled their incissor teeth eat very, very carefully? Dr David Lee: Hi ForMe,Composite/resin fillings are commonly done for small fractures or the front incisors. While it is possible for resin fillings to chip or break, they have the potential to last a long time.If the chip is very small, they tend to be less durable. Foods that have bones (such as chicken wings/ribs) are most likely to break any fillings on your incisors since you are putting alot of force on those teeth.If the filling is chipped or fractured, you can have it replaced. ForMe: Thank you for your reply.  Yes: if the filling breaks by me chewing with it, the filling can be replaced.  Except its not covered under my dental insurance and the cost is several hundred dollars.  That would be one expensive slice of pizza if it breaks the filling!Just wondering if most people with small chips try to avoid chewing on that filled tooth (less durable).   Eating this way takes a lot of effort, isn't very pleasant, and it looks awkward to others.Or, do most people just chew with the filled tooth and risk prematurely breaking the filling? Dr David Lee: I am not sure which insurance company you are with, but resin fillings on anterior teeth are usually covered in my experience. Did your dentist try to claim the filling through your insurance?It is very difficult to avoid chewing on that tooth specifically. The best thing is to avoid chewing the foods I mentioned in my last reply that are more likely to break the tooth. ForMe: Dr David Lee said:\t\t\tI am not sure which insurance company you are with, but resin fillings on anterior teeth are usually covered in my experience.

    "title": "Is this much erosion of gum normal?",
    "dialogue": "Erosion: I have a single tooth that has more gum erosion than any of the others.  I emailed my hygienist who is 30 miles away and told her about it just 2 weeks after my 6 month appointment.  The reason I'm so concerned about it is because she had pointed out that the tooth with the most gum erosion had a pocket of 6mm, and it the 6th tooth from the left on the bottom. But look at the 3rd tooth visible from the left and you can see it's much worse.  Almost as much root is visible as there is tooth!Anyway, she responded that she'd have to know exactly which tooth it was, so I replied by sending the picture of it so she could see.  I got no reply, so I sent it again and got no reply.  My next appointment is 5 months away and I don't want to wait that long to get an answer.So what do you all think?  Should I be concerned?  It just seems strange that the 3rd tooth has more erosion than the 6th, and yet I was told the 6th one is the worst.  Could this much erosion of the gum have happened just 2 weeks since my appointment? Plaza Dental Group: By viewing your snap, I would advice that Overzealous brushing can cause damage to teeth and gums.Note that the gums have receded and the roots, which are now showing, are also being abraded. You don't have to worry about that, but they can be indicative of periodontal disease. If this is the case, there are many treatment options such as simple cleanings or scaling and root planning.  Make sure you are brushing not scrubbing.

She's noted gum recession but thought it was normal with age, and also because of the fact that I had braces from when I was 34 until I was 36.  I'm 45 now and still use retainers.  I also have decalcification of teeth along the gum line and plenty of fillings.  I didn't realize that the roots are being abraded.  My hygienist hasn't said anything about that.  But that corner tooth seems to have the most gum recession and she didn't mention that at all, and now it has me concerned.  Do you have any idea why that one would especially have so much more recession?"

Shortly after my premolar next to the extraction site abcessed. I received a root canal and my dentist says he sees no more sign of infection but I'm still in pain. The pain can be described as sharp and intermittent, located in the jaw around the root and shooting into my ear. Please tell me what's going on. Brian Wasserman: I should say the second image is several months after the root canal was done. Plaza Dental Group: As a dentist, I recommend only after the properly diagnosis of the patient. Try not to get upset with your dentist. The reason you may be still experiencing pain is due to \"dry socket\". This is very painful and does last for a bit of time. Next time you see your doctors ask about any antibiotics, there may be more involved in your case. If you are now experiencing pain on the other side, seeing and oral Surgeon may be a good idea. You should apply an ice pack on the skin over the extraction site 20 minutes on and then 20 minutes off for the first 6-8 hours. Eating soft foods. Once you feel like you can chew those without any pain, then it’s probably alright to move on to harder foods. If you feel pain, that’s a sign that you need to back off and let your tissue heal some more. Your dentist/oral surgeon can give you more information about any special precautions you need to take depending on how your surgery went. I hope that helps. Good luck."

The tooth had chipped on the back side, though the filling may also be visible from the top.It may be relevant that a fair proportion of fillings done by the previous dentist had failed early on, though this was not the case with the filling on #24, which has been there 2 - 3 years.Anyway, I have started to feel sensations in the tooth--not always, but much of the time. This has been going on for at least a month. Nothing painful so far, but I wonder if perhaps the filling should be replaced.Found a good article which indicates how hard it can be to tell when fillings need to be replaced: http://www.dentistrytoday.com/diagnosis/979. I could be missing something, but don't notice any obvious discoloration in the tooth or cracks in the enamel (two criteria mentioned in the article).I imagine my current dentist will take x-rays and look carefully at the tooth.\nBut I wonder:1. In the absence of x-ray evidence or visible signs, would it make sense to replace the filling now just based on the sensations I feel?\n2. Is there much risk of damage to the tooth if the filling is replaced?\n3. If I do nothing now, and the sensations turn into pain, then what would my options be at that time?\n4.

    "dialogue": "Blank_276: There's no specific reason for this post, but I am curious. When I was a kid (early 2000s), the dentist I went to used two different kinds of local anesthesia for cavity fillings: a syringe (which I assume was Novocaine), and this... thing. He called it a \"pop gun\", probably to try to make it sound cute. It looked kind of like a dental drill without a bit and had two little holes at the head. Rather than inject something in the back of your mouth, it made a click followed by a very sharp sting. Not sure if it's just me, but whatever it was seemed to render the Novocaine useless, so I felt everything.The reason for my curiosity is that no dentist I've gone to after him ever used this contraption for cavity fillings, just nitrous oxide and Novocaine. Come to think of it, he used this lengthy cavity filling technique that I never encountered at any other dentist. Anyway... Does anyone here know of this instrument, and maybe why it isn't used anymore? Zuri Barniv: Have no idea, but it may be a \"Ligmaject\". Look it up and see. I use one all the time and it should not sting or hurt. Also, no one uses Novocaine, that's just from the movies. 99% of dentists primarily use Lidocaine."

    "dialogue": "zogthegreat: Hi everyone!I have had a strange dental problem with teeth numbers 5, 6, and 18 for about the last 5 years. These teeth are causing severe and at time blinding pain with changes in air pressure. All teeth have had root canals that were delayed for a varity of reasons and when the root canals were performed, the roots were necrotic/half dried out. The pain in teeth 5 and 6 were initially diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia, however I have none of the symptoms of trigeminal, other than the pain being in the general area of the trigeminal nerve. This pain, (5 and 6) would spread in a line, #5 going up my face, through the eye socket and into the scalp. #6 would go from the tooth along my cheek and into the back of my head. I finally convinced my dentist to extract #6 and that line of pain stopped after the extraction. #18 doesn't bother me that badly, it seems to just go down into my jawbone and not spread out.I have seen several dentist as well as a neurologist who have not been able to figure out what is going on.Does anyone have any suggestions to what I should look at next? I really would like to avoid having #5 pulled, but the pain is getting to be too much. Plaza Dental Group: I would suggest that you find an oral surgeon since you have pain and swelling.  It’s important for you to have a complete oral examination to determine the cause. Other causes of a toothache can include the following: Infection, Gum disease, Grinding teeth (bruxism), Tooth trauma, an abnormal bite. TMJ/TMD (Temporomandibular Joint Disorder), sinus or ear infections, and tension in the facial muscles can cause discomfort that resembles a toothache, but often these health problems are accompanied by a headache. Find a good dental clinic and get proper treatment for your toothache. Hope this answer will help you. Good luck."

Usually made of porcelain or acrylic, they can be fused to metal and slipped and glued over broken or damaged teeth. You need to see your dentist but probably crowns will be needed to repair that tooth or veneers will also do. Good luck to you! mikebs: I agree with @PlacidWay-US fullmouthdentalimplants: First you go to your dental specialist as quickly. Otherwise, your tooth could be damaged further or become infected, possibly causing you to end up losing the tooth. In your teeth little bit of polish severed, the repair should for the most part be possible just in one office visit. A seriously harmed or broken tooth may require a more protracted and expensive methodology. your dental specialist may repair the harm with a filling. On the off chance that the repair is to a front tooth or can be seen when you grin, your dental specialist will probably utilize a strategy called holding, which uses a tooth-colored composite resin.

    "dialogue": "Paulette: I have a 30 year old cavity between my front teeth.  It is miraculously not visible from the front.  You can only see it if you use a mirror and look behind my teeth.  I have had dentists up and down the East Coast of America try to get me to agree to having it filled.  I have always said no, since I was 15 years old.  Keep in mind, the cavity is still not visible when I smile and hasn't grown hardly at all. Why?  I don't understand that?Recently, I found a fabulous dentist and he also insists that a filling is the right thing to do.  The problem is that I really trust his work, and I have an appointment set for this 30 year cavity.  I am having panic attacks about it, and I would like for someone to clearly outline specific answers to help me keep focused on what is the correct thing to do.  Please and thank you!What are the risks if I have it filled?\nWhat are the risks if I don't have it filled?"

Also since your problem is chipped tooth you may need dental bonding, it is a cosmetic dentistry procedure. But first your dentist will examine your teeth in order to choose the correct type of composite resin color that most closely matches to the color of your existing teeth.  In most cases, the dental bonding procedure may take anywhere between 30 and 60 minutes per tooth. To give you an idea dental bonding helps restore strength, fill cavities, and repair cracks, chips or gaps found in the teeth. About the cost depending on geographic location, average dental bonding costs roughly between $100 and $400 per tooth, though in most locations, the average ranges between $300 and $600 per tooth. In locations such as India, dentists in Delhi, Mumbai, and Goa may charge between $20 and $50 per tooth. Hope this helps good luck to you."

There are some Dentist which provide their service at a very high price but failed to give your desired result. I am saying this in general since there are really cases like this. There are also some cases which you are registered to your local dentist but they don't have the capability to do some dental works so your other option will be to look for another one. This is true especially to medical travels who go abroad for some dental works which they can't have in their own country."

    "dialogue": "Erinlynn: For the last 8 months my boyfriend has been battling tooth pain. Well more like agony. It took several months of seeing dentists, oral surgeons, a tmjd specialist, and going to a medical center in Boston to get a very unhelpful answer. What was explained to him was that there was a combination of causes that lead to this pain. He had braces as a kid which they said caused him not to be able to brush right, he grinds his teeth in his sleep and he just has overall sensitivity. We weren't really happy with that answer but we took it and ran with it because it was the only thing we had to work with and this was really starting to ruin his life. By the point that we got this answer he had already had to drop out of school because he couldn't handle the stress, pain, and waking up early when he could barely sleep. Once this answer came about he got a mouth guard to sleep with that he always used. They gave him a low grade long term pain medication to be on. He was using special tooth paste and taking perfect care of his teeth, He was doing fluoride treatments and baking soda mouth rises to help. He cut everything bad for your teeth from his diet. well what ever was left of his diet.. He was always using straws, drinking mostly water, watching the Ph balance of his mouth. His teeth look perfect. They are white and straight and they say even his xrays look pretty good. He was doing everything in his power to get ride of this terrible god forsaken agony. NOTHING WORKS! Absolutely nothing works, And no one is doing a damn thing! By this point my boyfriend has decided he wants nothing to do with his teeth or life, He wants them all taken out and he wants to get dentures. He's 23... Now i know (mostly because its all i have been hearing at the other end of the phone) that he is so young for dentures. And i keep getting this \"we want to save the teeth\" crap. I'm so sick of this answer absolutely no one is listening to the problem. For the last 8 months my boyfriend has been drowning in hell. He has been in terrible or terrified that the pain will start up again. Currently half of his diet is pain medication. He eats maybe once a day twice if he isn't in too much pain. As i said he dropped out of school and is in the process of losing his job with all the sick days he has taken to either see someone or because he is in too much pain to function. He has let all of his friends, hobbies,wants,and family slip away from him. I am watching the light slow die in his eyes. The way he talks, the way he looks, he is just miserable. And now he is miserable to the point where he has lost hope, He doesn't want to do anything anymore. Life is point less to him, he no longer cares about anything and I am so terrified about what will happen if i cant find something. He has been so withdrawn and sad and i cant bare it anymore. I can no longer watch the love of my life slip away while he is still physically present. I'm so sick of calling the people who tell me they want to save the teeth I desperately need to find someone who will save the man. We live in Rhode Island but I am willing to travel to wherever whenever to get this done. If insurance wont cover him getting dentures someplace will pay out of pocket. We have family that can help, we will take out loans, ill work 8 jobs if i need to. I am just in desperate need of help. I have no idea what to do anymore. I just need a place willing to extract healthy looking teeth to give my man his life back. He in no way shape or form cares about his teeth or keeping them. While i know other people get upset about getting them he doesn't care, He is one of the most confident people i know. He just wants to live life again. Please someone, anyone please help us. I want him to live, we are both terrified of whats to come. This so stressful and aggravating. No one seems to care to help. I will go anywhere to get him out of pain. If anyone has ideas or actual know of someone please let me know. You will be giving a young man his life back. PlacidWay-US: Hi @Erinlynn i can feel you. It is really hard for a guy to have a very bad teeth and as you stated it really affects your boyfriends life. Guys are number one self concious in terms of how they look. About his case you may seek a second opinion, there should be an initial assesment if there is a need to take out all his teeth and have dentures. Maybe there are other dental treatment available so don't fall into dentures alone. You also stated traveling abroad for a paricular treatment, Just to give you an idea it is not easy to look for a good dentist and dental centers abroad. You need to do more deep research and background checking. The best option for you to look into is either Mexico or Costa Rica there are also good dental clinics in Asia but you really need to do more research. Good luck!"

Zack Keihani: Hi , \nI was in your shoes about 12 years ago back in U.K. I decided to leave dentistry as well because I was doing the same procedures again and again. In 2002 , I took a year off and lived in different places in USA but became bored very soon . I then returned to my country of birth , Iran and started a brand new practice www.mytehrandentist.com and good things started to happen for me. Because of my background in U.K. and Denmark and my 12 years of clinical expertise I soon became the trusted dentist for all the European embassies and oil companies operating in Tehran and became a real success in matter of 2-3 years. I no longer had to do root canals , fillings etc as I hired other specialist dentist to do those for me. The last 8-10 years I have been doing only cosmetic dentistry and Implants and I love it. \nIn short , there are very very few positions for a general dentist other than dentistry . Try to take 6 months off and new ideas will come to you. I am now 52 years old and love my work. I hope this helps !"

    "title": "any treatment to save tooth pulp (nerve)?",
    "dialogue": "poka: Recently a large infection was found on my tooth and was informed that the tooth pulp might need to be removed if the infection reaches there. Currently I live in Japan and it seems there is a treatment that dentist applies antibiotics paste on an infected area, which possibly removes the infection and the dentin can be grown back. (This treatment was first developed in Japan and is known as 3Mix, which is to use a mixed paste of three antibiotics. However, nowadays the combination of antibiotics can be different by dentists and the dentist I saw is using metronidazole only because he thinks this alone gives sufficient effectiveness.)Unfortunately my tooth infection seems really big so I feel no choice of removing tooth pulp sooner or later but at moment thought of giving this antibiotics thing a try in order to delay the removal if possible. I just wondered if this kind of treatment is popular in other countries and is there any other treatment to save tooth pulp? Thanks! Anna Wiliams: Thanks for sharing this information. I think this mixture used by Most countries now all depends on level of infection. As in your case i went to bad and ended in removal. Hope other may get to notice early and stop it early stage. poka: Hi Anna, \nThank you for your comment. It seems this antibiotics thing is effective and being used for mainly children here. Hope to hear more people's comments. Thank you! Enrique: As far as I know root canal procedure as done to save the infected too right?? poka: Thanks for comments. I will close this post now. I am not sure about the root canal procedure. I prefer to get stuffs done as little as possible.Afterall, I got my teeth applied with 3-Mix. The teeth was infected deeply as nearly reaching nerve. I may need to extract this teeth if I become feel pain in future. I wonder why I did not feel pain at all for this big infection.. having less artificial stuffs on mouth is better for health and well-being I think."

    "dialogue": "Tonia39: My son (17) had braces for a couple of years and has had them off now for nearly three years. He still uses his invisalign type retainers at night. The ortho (a wonderful man) spent lots of time worrying about these lower molars and one upper molar that just would not erupt fully. He sent us to a oral surgeon (also a great guy) who manipulated both of those teeth and the one on the top to push/twist them toward full eruption. Not sure what the procedure is called, but it sounds worse than it is. The one on the top turned out great, and one on the bottom also successful. The other on the bottom just refused to cooperate.Flash forward, both the lower molars in question have been diagnosed with \"root resorption.\" Regular dentist sent us to an endo who concurred that they were beyond saving and would eventually need to come out. Good grief. We do not have the money to pay for implants, even with insurance. The teeth are asymptomatic at this time. No pain, functioning properly, brushed and flossed three times a day. Endo says just watch them and it could be years for them to become truly problematic. Dentist wants to pull NOW. What happens if we just don't do anything at all? Will the body simply \"eat\" the tooth? Will these teeth just be like wisdom teeth back there, no roots but not really causing trouble? If we have them pulled, I cannot afford to replace them. Can his retainers hold everything in place to keep things from shifting after these teeth are removed?I'm embarrassed to admit to our dentist that we don't have the money to pay for all this stuff, but, even with the excellent dental insurance we have, it will only cover 60% of the cost. Plus, we have an annual limit of $2500 per person. Even with that truly decent coverage, we are looking at thousands of dollars at a point in our lives when we've got to save every dime toward college!Any thoughts are appreciated."

I went to a dentist and he drained the puss using a syringe. After sometime I went and got it surgically extracted. After that and for years now, I have been suffering from pain in that area but can't identify its source and all the dentists that I've visited can't find anything wrong. The pain is in the upper left side, I can't describe it that well but it feels like pressure, migraine or some kind of infection. When the pain sets in, it won’t go away except by taking a good pain killer. Even trying to sleep it off wouldn’t work. An important thing to mention: Recently, when I probed the gums between 2 molars with a toothpick, and blood came out I would feel relieved from that pain in about 5 minutes from doing that. This no longer works though CharlesH: Greetings,I sympathize with your left upper molar pain.  I deal with this as well and can't give you an answer why but wanted to say hoping you find the problem.  I will like you wait for a knowledgeable doctor to answer.

    "dialogue": "Romonator: Lower Left Molar (#19) had old Metal Filling that cracked six months ago. Dentist told me that it may need Root Canal, but he was going to first try replacing the filling, which he did successfully. Then two months ago I started feeling cold sensitivity to that same tooth. Concerned that the filling was failing, I went back, but x-rays and exam showed no problem. Sensitivity to cold continued, with only an occasional soreness, so I returned. Again x-rays / exam showed nothing. Was referred to Endodontist, who concluded that Root Canal wasn't necessary yet but may happen eventually. Last few weeks, sensitivity has gotten worse, but no pain. Get a slight discomfort drinking cold, and a twinge occasionally just taking deep breath. There is no pain, but just a feeling of pressure that is pretty constant. I also have sensitivity on the tooth directly above #19, but some also on the other side of my mouth as welI. It seems my whole mouth just feels different. Sometimes It feels like there is some sticky substance on all of my molars! I have had grinding issues in the past and I wonder if all this can be caused by a return of that. Or maybe they are getting overly sensitive as I age (52 yrs old.) I have just started using sensitive toothpaste. My Dad and older brother lost all their teeth prematurely due to poor care and I am very careful. I am not averse to any procedure but want to be sure that any procedure is indeed necessary and will fix the problem. Do these symptoms sound familiar to anyone? Thanks in advance!"

I did the root canal, pain remained, no change. I went to another dentist. He said I needed my wisdom teeth removed. I removed both on the right side only, pain stopped.After that I started getting chest pains, I'm only now realizing that's when it started. I went to multiple cardiologists and doctors. They said it was anxiety.Fast forward to 2 months ago. The crown on my root canal cracked and broke. I went back to the dentist who put it on, he replaced it with another.Immediately after he replaced it, I felt pain and tightness on the tooth. Like a clamp had been applied to it. My bite felt...off. I told them that but was ignored.Fast forward 2 weeks later. Intense pain developed in my tooth along with HORRIBLE ringing in my head. It's like both ears but doesn't feel like it's coming from my ears, like it's just in my head and I'm hearing it with my ears. Also, my face goes numb, espescially my chin and tongue. My hands go numb. My feet go numb. I get shooting sensations like electrical shocks through my body. Horrible shoulder pain, back pain, neck pain, chest pain more severe.I went back to the dentist. He said he had to file down the crown because my bite was off. He did this and pain remained for about 4 days then improved a lot (only the pain in the tooth itself improved).Fast forward to today (6 weeks since intense pain). Pain is still in that tooth if I bite down on it but not nearly as severe. If I grab the tooth and move it around the ringing in my head goes CRAZY. I'm still having all of these horrible symptoms. I feel like I'm dying. The ringing in my head is so loud and so high pitched it's...I don't even have a word to describe the horror.I've been to neurologist, ent, vascular doctor, cardiologist, chiropractor (chiropractor said my back was so messed up he couldn't adjust it), Massage therapist (massage therapist told me he'd never seen muscles so messed up and was scared to even give me a massage), acupuncturist, even was admitted to the hospital where they ran a bunch of tests for two days and could not find anything wrong.My dentist claims it's not my tooth but it hurts still???? I don't know what to do has anyone ever heard of this? JoshW: I went to another dentist today. He said he has no clue why that tooth hurts and it shouldn't be hurting. He did a test on it though and said it's obvious that tooth has pain and no other one does. He said I should just get it pulled because it doesn't make any sense. Guess I'm going to try that."

    "dialogue": "luckyman316: Bare with me, as this is sort of a longer story but I'm looking for opinions. Last July, I had cracked my tooth around a filling I had done (non-metal). I ended up going to my dentist, who cut the tooth down (tooth #31) and fitted me for a gold crown. Gold crown was fitted tight next to tooth #30, not as loose my teeth would normally be. Sometime after this, about 3 days, I developed some weird symptom where I keep feeling like I had some sort of head cloudiness or my eyes would feel like they would roll in the back of my head. I also, somehow, became unbalanced and also became afraid of heights all of the sudden (I never used to be by the way)Same dentist later discovered that tooth #30, which also had a filling in it, developed deep decay under the filling. He had sent me for a root canal and then eventually put he post in there and put a gold crown on it. Both crowns are next to each other and the way he shaped them, he put them so tight and almost next to each other because he did not want to see any more food get trapped in there under the crown, causing more decay. Also also developed tinnitus around this time too (I think it was right before the root canal though, I can't recall)Fast forward almost 8 months later, I went to a new dentist who immediately noticed I was unbalanced after checking my teeth and ears. He suggested a few things. He said that the bite on the crown with the root canal was off. He also suggested the crowns were too tight together, giving me issues with nerves on tooth #31. He then suggested that the work that was done, was causing the imbalance in my head especially since I had wisdom teeth removed many years ago (I had no issues after this). He presented me with a few options to fix this and wanted me to go with the cheapest, as he didn't want me to spend money.Has anyone heard of issues like this? What would be the reccommended fix? I've been to neurologist, they found nothing. I've been to ENT, they told me it was symptoms of Meniere's, regular MDs just told me I was having panic attacks, etc. Curious if dental work can be involved here...

Unfortunately, Sarah's teeth are getting pretty bad.

How do I help her? I rarely get to see her but I will soon and wish to go with some tools to help as best I can. We're in the UK, and probably be using the NHS, for what it's worth.

I'm not sure I can post an active link here - so the URL is 'dentalfearcentral dot org'.Having visited there a few times, I can say that most people talk about themselves, but there was a question not too long ago about an autistic child's special dental needs and some ways to keep her comfortable enough to endure treatment. I think someone there would be very likely to field your question.There are dentists and patients alike there, so you might get both perspectives. The site is UK-based, so people know the NHS - but it has international membership (including plenty of Americans like me).The people there also offer dental recommendations, so you may be able to get more info about a particular dentist with some skill at handling phobic or anxious patients."

In the United States, most denture procedures range from $300-$8,000. In the case of those who require implants for an entire arch or the full mouth, costs may reach $15,000 or more. In Costa Rica, dentures may cost $150-$400 and in Thailand, around $400-$900.  Costs for a full upper or lower arch ranges between $500 and $2500.

She seemed frustrated and said it is fine and I just needed to get used to it. \n         So I left and since then have felt pain when putting pressure on the tooth. I thought maybe it needed to settle so I waited a few months and went back to the dentist 6 months later. She said I need to see the person who did the root canal. So I went to the endodontist and she said she didn't know why I was feeling pain, as it doesn't show infection on root canal. She said she would discuss with dentist and get back to me. It wasn't until 3 weeks later the dentist got back to me. They said I should see a periodontist. So I went to another dentist to get a second opinion. This dentist said form the x-rays it looked like a violation of biological width problem and I needed a crown lengthening. He talked with the endodontist and they agreed that I should have the crown taken off to make sure. Sure enough as soon as she took off the crown my whole tooth cavity filled with blood, she showed me a picture, as the crown was pushing into the gums. She put a temporary crown on, with space from gum, to see if swelling would go down.\n         It has been four weeks with the temporary crown. When I went back she said it is still swollen and she noticed gingival damage that may take more than 3 months to heal. I've decided to just get the tooth extracted, as I can't afford a crown lengthening and I don't want to do this treatment. I want to ask for a refund for the tooth, but I don't know who I should ask. Does anyone know is this considered a malpractice, as it seems it is the dentist's fault for preparing my tooth too short for the crown to fit? Also who would be the one to blame, the endodontist who did the root canal or the dentist who fit the crown? I'm not sure who is the one that lowered my tooth beyond biological width. This tooth has caused me so much trouble and pain, I feel it would only be right to give a refund if it was the dentist's fault. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

    "dialogue": "Horatio: Hi, I am 36 years old. I was born with a condition in which around 40% of my teeth didn’t come with adulthood replacements. Since 12 I have had orthodontic work done and by 23 I got an extensive (and expensive) work done involving crowns and bridges (by my current Doctor), for which several teeth were pulled out (I argued I wanted all of them saved but because of spacing he advised against). He said, because of my age, that would be the best solution then, leaving future developments in the field possible for me. At the time, I was happy with my smile. Since then, in average, every 3 years there has been a failure of a unit that has to be redone (at my expense). Last year I had enough of this and insisted in a new stage of my life to start replacing failed bridges with implants and crowns. My first one was a 4-unit bridge being replaced with 2 implants but he left the old retainer crowns. Now, an adjoining bridge failed, one that was sharing one of those eroded retainers. I was happy to proceed with an implant but unfortunately the bone has been lost over that specific bridge (remember I had teeth pulled out); he wants to do a Zirconia bridge.By now you might understand how I feel and when is this going to end. I take good care of my teeth and diet. I am left with this complex dental condition (his creation), which is becoming a financial load on me. I feel as well he has neglected aesthetics in his work regarding whitening and color matching but that is another story; I am not 100% happy with my smile now. I wish I could have work done which guarantee me 25 years of mostly peace of mind and a happy smile…I am just looking for external thoughts on my case, thanks for your time."

You must keep in mind that it's impossible to predict how an extraction will turn out.  Each tooth and each extraction is different.  It looks like you have good bone support around the tooth and the roots are spread apart, so it may take more than two minutes to get it out, but hopefully not much more than that.  Good luck. Enrique: The key to coping with dental fear is to discuss your fears with your dentist. Once your dentist knows what your fears are, he or she will be better able to work with you to determine the best ways to make you less anxious and more comfortable. If your dentist doesn't take your fear seriously, find another dentist."

    "title": "Dental Phobia",
    "dialogue": "JJ_8613: Hi everyone.I'm struggling right now with Dental Phobia.  I've had this since I was a young child and now as an adult, it's gotten to the point where I can't manage it anymore.For years I've been forcing myself to go to the dentist to get my regular check ups and cleanings.  Now I'm at the point where even a simple cleaning appointment or check up makes me extremely anxious and fearful.I've had a lot of problems with my teeth over the years and it's only getting worse.  I've had more cavities filled than I can count.  I've had 4 root canals in my life and one of them was only a few weeks ago.  Also dealing with adult braces which are almost ready to come off after 3 1/2 years.My anxiety and phobia is way out of control now.  Just getting a toothache or thinking about going to the dentist disrupts my life.  I'm loosing sleep, having nightmares and I've started having flashbacks about past dental visits.I finally made the decision to start seeing a sedation dentist who uses nitrous oxide.  I was up front with them when I made the appointment on the phone and told them about my anxiety and phobia and the severity.  This new patient appointment is in about a week and a half and I'm already nervous about it.I know I need to have some restorative work done on my teeth soon, as I now have 3 teeth that have had root canals that need to get crowns.  The catch is I have to wait until I get my braces off to get the crowns.  I'm getting increasing nervous about the procedure as I know nothing about it and I'm starting to worry about the amount of time that has passed since getting the root canals.  Two of the teeth had the work done about a year and a half ago.So, I'm just really trying to find a way to deal with all of this.  I really hope the nitrous oxide helps me, because if it doesn't I don't know what I'll do.  I'm planning to get some therapy for my phobia at some point, but can't currently due to financial issues.This has all just gotten out of hand.  The last time I went to the dentist I nearly cried.Dental appointments are also difficult for me due to TMJ problems/pain and that I'm hard to numb for dental work.  This has led to a fear of needles/injections.Any advice or comments would be great.  I just really need help coping with this.Thanks.JJ Zuri Barniv: I find that oral sedatives help my fearful patients. The medicine is basically a glorified sleeping pill like Halcion (Triazolam), Valium or Ativan and it really calms the nerves much more effectively than laughing gas. The disadvantage is you cannot be pregnant when taking it, someone has to drive you to and from the appointment and you will be groggy most of the day. There are other risks the dentist can discuss with you. Overall, it may be worth trying. Enhance Dentist: Tell all your concerns to the dentist. I believe he/she will understand what your worries and fears about. But if you are afraid of surgery, some doctor recommends their patient to have anesthesia that puts you to sleep. Just be open, nothing to be feared of. JJ_8613: Hi again.Thank you both for your replies.I did tell my dentist about my dental phobia and anxiety at my first appointment.  I actually wrote a letter ahead of time detailing my concerns and past traumas and so forth.  We went over it all together and he said that he understood and that there would be no problem accommodating me.He actually offered me Valium to try, but I did turn him down because I don't want to have an escort home and I need to be able to go to work after appointments.He was very understanding and he and his staff are working with me on my issues.The only thing I've ever felt I need to be out for is extractions.  I don't know why, but for some reason those really scare me.Thanks again.JJ Jordan: JJ_8613 said:\t\t\tHi again.Thank you both for your replies.I did tell my dentist about my dental phobia and anxiety at my first appointment.

Going to your Dentist was your best option and it looks like it worked out for the best. Hopefully you and your Dentist can work towards getting you more comfortable. JJ_8613: Hi.Thank you for your reply.I'm sorry you've dealt with this also.I actually have seen this dentist 3 times now.  One was an emergency appointment.  I have an appointment today for a deep cleaning.  I'm leaving in about 30 minutes for it. I'm a nervous wreck though.  I still haven't gotten my phobia and anxiety under control.  I'm nervous, anxious and fearful.  I've never had this kind of work done before and since my teeth and gums are really sensitive I'm afraid to have something like this done.This dentist and his staff are really good with me though.  They're very patient and they go at my pace.They're even having an assistant go in with me, at my request, because I know her the best out of all the staff so far.  She really puts me at ease.  At least as much as I can be at the dentist.I'll update you all when I get back.Thanks.JJ JJ_8613: Hi all.I'm feeling relieved right now. Just got back from my dentist's appointment for my deep cleaning. I'm having a little gum tenderness and soreness, but this is normal and to be expected.The hygienist showed me before and after pictures after we'd finished. I can't believe it. My teeth went from yellow to a shiny white. They look like they're brand new again. My gums went from a puffy red to a healthy pink. This was all just from one appointment.I had the nitrous oxide even though I paid out of pocket. That stuff works miracles. I went from an anxious, nervous, fearful mess to completely relaxed. Honestly it feels like you've had too much to drink, but my anxiety was gone in just a few minutes. The hygienist told me that the procedure actually took 2 1/2 hours instead of two like we though it'd be. I couldn't believe it though, because it only felt like 15 - 20 minutes. I guess the nitrous makes you lose sense of time temporarily and they said that's how it is for some people.I'm just so glad I went. That appointment prevented me from getting periodontal disease, which is irreversible and causes lots of problems.Thank you all for your support.JJ Enrique: Dental techniques have improved so much over the last few years that modern dental treatment can now be completely painless. Despite this, most people still feel a little nervous at the thought of going to the dentist. If you have not been to see a dentist for some time, you will probably find that things have improved a lot since your last visit. The general attitude is likely to be more relaxed, the dental techniques and safety procedures will be much better, and the equipment will be more up to date. If you fear going to the dentist it will not affect your oral health but also your overall health and also will leave a bad impression on your family as they will also fear to go to dentist. Therefore it is very much important to find a good dental clinic which not helps to overcome your dental phobia but also provides complete dental care to your family as well. JJ_8613: Hi everyone.I see it's been awhile since I've been on here.  I have some updates.As for the dental side, all is well right now.  No problems currently with my teeth or gums.  My new insurance through work kicks in on March 20, 2016.  I'm planning to schedule a dental appointment in early April.I had a bit of a rough start because this is a new dental office.  I've never been there before and never even met the doctor.  I re-scheduled one appointment already, due to work.  I missed another appointment just due to my own fear and anxiety.  So, I'm not calling them yet until I know for sure that I can and will go.The good thing about the new job is that I will have some week days off and work some weekends.  That will definitely help my anxiety, as I won't feel rushed during my dental appointments and have to rush back to work after.So, right now I'm feeling nervous.  My first appointment with the new office will be a new patient exam and x-rays.  Then I'll have to schedule a cleaning.  Then the real work begins.  I still have 4 molars with root canal treatments that need crowns.  I also will have to ask the new doctor about my other issues, like the external root resorption in 3 teeth and whatever else he may find.  I'll have to find out if I’m still in early periodontal disease or if it's gotten better or worse.So many unknowns really make me nervous.The good thing is that with my new job, I'm a federal employee, so the benefits I signed up for will really help with the cost.  I have a high amount with my dental insurance, so they will cover half of all major work (including crowns) and the annual maximum allowed is high.So many things I've been waiting to do, but I was waiting on this new job and insurance.I also have to get my glasses prescription renewed.  I'm near sighted, so I can see near, but not far without glasses.  My current pair is two or more years old, and I can tell the prescription is getting fuzzy now.  Time for a new pair.\nOh, also I really researched my insurances before I chose them.  My new dentist who I want to start seeing, Dr. C., is on the insurance approved list and if I ever have to have root canal work done or re-done my endodonist, Dr. G., is also on the insurance approved list.  That was one of my big worries was that I wouldn't be able to continue seeing them both.I think that's all for the update.  It's really just dental anxiety and fear starting to build up again.I hope you are all doing well.Thanks for reading.JJ"

Gives more details about it so anyone can help you. \nIf you feel it will pull itself then concern dentist immediately. Enrique: Gums that are pink and firm are indicators of a healthy body. However, if you notice that your gums are changing colours, there may be various reasons behind it. While gum discolouration to an extent is a normal occurrence, it can also be a sign of an underlying disease. Gingivitis is the most common reason for having bright red gums. It can cause red, swollen and bleeding gums and needs proper dental treatment. Ignoring it can lead to a severe form of gum disease called periodontitis which can destroy the tissue and bone supporting your teeth. Additionally, if you notice white oryellow sores in your mouth along with bright red gums, then it may be due to a viral infection. Reem Khaled: Is there's any bleeding when you brush your teeth or while flossing ?\nif so from when did you start noticing that ?\nmost probably this would be a cause of gingivitas \" inflammation in your gum \" ... you have to visit a doctor to get you the proper treatment plan for this  but for the swelling ; you can irrigate you mouth at the morning and at night by a solution of a water and salt to decrease this inflammation which will reduce the swelling In shaa Allah Enrique: I absolutely agree with you Reem, it is really important to maintain a good oral care routine and follow a healthy diet to avoid dental problems like decay."

    "dialogue": "MimiLouise88: Hi,I really hope someone can help me! I am asking about my three year old son. About a year ago one of his front teeth (milk tooth) appeared to be shortening, I realised it was moving up into the gum. It slowly (over months) moved up until there was only a tiny amount showing. People constantly asked if he had lost a tooth. As far as I am aware he experienced no trauma to his mouth that might have caused this. The only way would be if it was caused by a minor bump that he didn't even tell me about! I took him to the dentist twice, he could not understand why it had happened if there was no mouth injury, he didn't X-ray or investigate further, just said what he could see of the tooth looked healthy so just to leave it.Towards the end of last year the tooth began to move down again on its own. By January it was almost level with the other front tooth. I was relieved and thought that was the end of it. However the tooth appears now to have started moving up again. It also appears slightly discoloured, yellow. I'm sorry this is such a long message but I'm so worried and the dentist doesn't see any issue with it! They don't want to X-ray because of his age. Please can anyone offer any advice?! Hope to hear from someone soon Marie Zuri Barniv: I have never in my career heard of a tooth going into, out of, then into the jaw again. The most likely explanation is that the gums are growing up (getting swollen) which gives the illusion of the tooth sinking in. You need to investigate why that may be happening instead. Enrique: Please take your child to the dentist immediately. It is very important to start maintaining your child's oral health since the time he/she is born. Mothers of new born babies often believe that because the baby is missing teeth, their mouth does not require any cleaning. This is an unhealthy practice that is dangerous to your baby’s health. A mouth has bacteria irrespective of the person’s age. It is important to clean the mouth of babies right from birth. Use a damp and soft piece of cloth to clean the gums of your baby. With your finger, try and clean the tongue. MimiLouise88: Thank you for your responses, he has an appointment tomorrow so hopefully they will have some answers. If the gum is swelling would that make only one tooth look like it was moving up? Enrique he is 3 and has a full set off teeth which I brush twice daily and have since he was a baby. he has visited the dentist since age 2.5 so I don't believe it is related to bacteria or poor hygiene but thank you for responding to my post Enrique: Ohh Ok..anyways m glad you appreciated my comment. Thanks!! and take care of your little one."

Enrique: Your gums are very important to your oral health. The gums are made up of firm, pink tissue that covers your jawbones. This tissue is thick, fibrous, and full of blood vessels. If your gums become swollen, they may protrude, or bulge out. Swelling in your gums usually begins where the gum meets the tooth. Your gums may become so swollen, however, that they begin to hide parts of your teeth. Swollen gums appear red instead of their normal pink.Swollen gums, also called gingival swelling, often become irritated, sensitive, and/or painful. You may also notice that your gums bleed more easily when brushing or flossing your teeth."

In the last while (maybe a year or so) ive been having bad breath and i couldnt realise why this was, until about a month or so when i rubbed my gum with my finger above my crown and got an awful smell from my finger (smelling like infection or even feeces) my tooth/crown isnt painful whatsoever so im just not sure what the problem could be. Any help or advise would be greatly appreciated, \nHere is a picture of the back of the crown, im not sure if this is what the back of a crown is meant to look like or not but i hope this picture might help diagnose my problem..\nThank you very much in advance\nKeithHere is a photo of the back of the crown to try help diagnose the problem zaheen: Probably i think you got a traumatic injury on your front teeth & there is a infection inside the tooth which is causing the problem.Take an xray so that you can know the situation inside the tooth.If there is a infection ypu will need Root canal treatment followed by crown placement. Great Lakes Dental: Hi 1keith1, Do you recall if your front tooth was root canaled before the new crown was placed back in 2010? If you lost a major portion of your tooth, then most likely a root canal would've been performed. In any event, what you've described is most certainly an infection that will require either a retreat, antibiotics or both. The reason you've haven't been experiencing pain is because 1) it sounds as though the infection is draining (which both relieves pressure by way of the infection draining into your mouth causing bad breath/taste) and 2) likely your tooth has been root canaled. Leaving your infection untreated for any longer, may result in even more damage to your oral structure (such as accelerated bone loss). I recommend you seek treatment at your very earliest opportunity.Regards, Dr. Jennifer Thomm\nCosmetic Dentist\nSarnia, Ontario Canada"

Ive been noticing that my dental floss in one pocket will have blood on the dental floss, not really bleed but just have blood on the string. And sometimes I will hit it again and then no blood on the floss. Then last tight I noticed a very faint red streak when I spit into the sink. Just an almost trace amount of blood. Less than 1/4 of a droplet of what apeared to be blood.  Again my teeth dont usually bleed. Is this a problem I read that its not a problem unless my gums actively bleed even after brushing and flossing.  And then I read that your gums should not bleed at all? DanyRoden: Well, I am not a dentist so can't tell anything, but give you some tips. Use a soft toothbrush and be sure to floss beyond the gum line to remove more plaque. Rinse with salt water or hydrogen peroxide to keep that area clean. You should notice it till one week if your gums blood regularly then concern a dentist. \nTake care Dear. zaheen: Probably you are not doing the floss the way it has to be used and may be due to that you are getting injury in your gums,so please use it the way it has to be used Great Lakes Dental: Hi morbe77, The problem you've described is not abnormal and on it's own, shouldn't be much of a concern. When it comes to your gums, what you need to be watching for is signs of Periodontal Disease. Symptoms may include: red, swollen and tender gums, persistent bad breath, and/or teeth that appear to be getting longer. Profuse bleeding during or after you brush or floss would also be a warning sign. Small traces of blood, without the presence of any other symptoms, shouldn't be a concern. Hope this helps.

    "dialogue": "Destiny Joy: A little background, I have never had a cavity a day in my life, not even as a kid. In fact the only thing I've ever gotten done at the dentist from youth till now, age 32, is a cleaning and routine stuff. Nothing out of the ordinary. Flash forward a lot of years, age 31. I don't remember the time from when I had my last dental visit between teenager to now. Anyways, I went to the dentist on October 27, 2015 to be exact. I was having tooth pain. I thought I had my first cavity. But it just ended up being plaque under my gums from not going to the dentist in all those years. A cleaning fixed that right up. I had no more problems with my teeth. They did x-rays found a chipped tooth number 11 from me biting down on my tongue ring. I was supposed to went back the following week to let them fix it, but I was scared. I've been having headaches and ear aches since September 2015. But I just brushed it off as a sinus headache. Because I did have sinus stuff going on too. I think things got worse in December 2015. The pain was an 8, still they told me it was my sinuses. January the pain was up to a 10+ so, I went to the emergency room. they did a ct scan found nothing gave me a morphine shot which didnt help told me to follow up with a neurologist and a ear nose throat specialist. I saw the ear nose throat specialist first january 29, i thought she was going to run tests but she looks in my ear with the same tool as everyone else has been using said nothing was wrong with my ear. My ear pain felt like my eardrum was busting open that's how bad it was. She asked me if i had my wisdom teeth i told her yes. She said open up my mouth, she said you're biting your gums so that means it's your wisdom teeth.\nOkay now, I went to the dentist February 1, 2016. My words to them was I need to get my wisdom teeth checked, not pulled. They did an x-ray of my wisdom teeth, because apparently I moved and it didnt show all my teeth. Put in mind I haven't seen the dentist yet, the lady that has been dealing with me came and asked me if they can pull my teeth that day someone cancelled, I told them I would have to be put to sleep for that. I have no tolerance for pain, and i am somewhat scared of needles. The dentist finally comes in, he not once looked in my mouth. I kept asking him are you sure i need my teeth pulled, he said yes. I was like I just went to the dentist less than 6 months ago, i couldn't remember when i went and this is a different dentist from Oct they couldn't see me till the 5th and i had to know then, and they didnt say anything about my wisdom teeth then. To make a long story short he said it was infected (can they get infected in less than 3 months?), and that they can cause headache and earache. Oh I left out a key factor, I was NOT feeling any pain in my mouth at all. Shoot my mouth felt good. So, despite my hesitation, I gave in and let them pull them. I only had the lower, my upper ones haven't came in. So, they did the iv thing and gave me something in a needle i think. i drifted off. I wasn't awake for the numbing thank God, but i came to as they was pulling tooth number one, i was scared and i felt something so they numbed it more, he pulled at the tooth it came out without a problem, from google i'm assuming that tooth wasn't impacted. from the xray it didn't look like it would be hard to get. But tooth number two, it was impacted. And I was fully aware of everything he was doing, just not alert enough to say stop. He kept pulling yanking and yanking and pulling but that tooth didnt want to budge, when that didn't work he started using something else i dont know what it was, so he would alternate between the yanking and pulling and that other tool. It did finally come out, he didn't fully stitch this tooth said it was too close to my other teeth for him to do it, so it was left open. something didnt feel right. All the information that I know i got from google, but even then it only tells you so much. I wish my story ended there. Week one: The pain kept getting worse instead of better. I called that office everyday to make sure what i was feeling was normal. On one occasion they said it was normal, one occasion they said its not dry socket or you would've developed it wednesday, (i called them that day too), another day i had teeth sensitivity. They say brush more. Every occasion, they told me i didn't need to come in. Well, Saturday i ran out of pain pills had to go to the er, they put me on an antibiotic, gave me tylenol 3 told me to follow up with the dentist. Week two: I was still in pain monday morning so i called the dentist, they told me i shouldnt still be in pain come in. it ended up being dry socket, what they told me i didn't have in week one. he just kept saying it was a very difficult extraction. put some type of paste or something and put a gauze there. i was fine.started healing nicely. still had a little pain but I was taking Motrin, so I was good. Sometime during that week I started finding it painful for me to talk, eat, cough, (i ended up getting a really nasty cold). Something was literally poking my tongue. I thought it was the stitches I was feeling i felt it on both sides of my tongue. Week three: The poking was very unbearable so i went to the dentist again thursday Feb 18. They told me it was bones that was sticking me, not stitches (is this normal after an extraction, according to google its normal when you have surgery or trauma during extraction?) he said he'd file it down and i'll start back healing. He only did one side, the side with the difficult extraction, said he didnt see anything on the other side. as soon as the numbing wore off, i felt the poking again. By this time i was fed up with this particular dentist. I called around and practically begged another dentist to see me. Nobody wanted to touch what someone else did. I finally convinced the dentist I went to in October to see me. He said they didnt do a good job of filing done the bone. so, he sawed into my gums both sides, the side they didnt do took more time. he said the healing will be set back a couple of days but it should get better now. NO, that's still not the end. I saw him Friday, Sunday my mouth was feeling weird, i couldn't drink normally, i had to use a straw or it bothered my gums. I still have to use a straw. Monday i started feeling the bone again on the difficult extraction side. And sometime later in the week i started feeling the bone on the other side. And it's painful again. About three maybe four days ago i started feeling sensitivity all over my teeth. And my mouth is really sore and it has a little swelling. I have not been able to live without Motrin since Ive had my teeth pulled. Ive gone all day without taking it, but by the end of the day i'm crying in pain. Its so bad that the Motrin has started eating at my stomach and causing me stomach complications. So, i have to come off. Today I took the tylenol 3 that i got from the er visit that i never took. I am literally terrified of going back to the dentist. What should i do? Has anyone else had this experience?"

If i eat any food on this temp crown (nothing hard) is still hurts. Should i wait until the permanent crown or is that not normal and the procedure has failed? Zuri Barniv: Sometimes teeth hurt more after they are prepared for a crown and it can take months before they calm down. Sometimes when there is a crack in a tooth, you need to do an additional procedure (a root canal). If a root canal and crown is done and the tooth still hurts, there may be nothing more to do but remove it, unfortunately. You might wait 2-3 more weeks with the temporary and see if it starts to calm down before proceeding.\nDr. Barniv"

I just don’t know how to bring myself to do this and all the while his teeth keep decaying more. Thank you for your input. DanyRoden: I think filling is not a good idea at this age, as your child has baby tooth right now, so wait until at least age 5. Anaesthetic or any other method is not a good idea. Good Luck Dear. secure: Hi, Nikjksdfj. Really felt sad for your little one. Making your kid Anaesthetic is a doubtful thing. Because we don’t know how the child will react to that kind of drugs. My child had undergone an oral sedation at sierra dental, Calgary. But he is 7 years old. And the sedation was given by consumption of a pill.

    "dialogue": "superbadsmile: I attached a picture of my tooth, it's the right canine. Originally both of my canines were growing sideways and I had an incomplete set of upper teeth. After going to the orthodontist, he turned me into a project and made room for the teeth and after a couple surgeries I got them both down. One looks perfectly fine and the other is a grayish color and it's always had this white 1-2 mm line right where it meets the gum line, I went to the dentist specifically for this because I find myself constantly hiding it from people. immediately he was just trying to rush me out of the chair and said some bull that  sometimes they come down discolored if they spend too much time before surfacing and gave me absolutely no reason for the white line either, he told me the solution was to just brush it. The heck??????? I've been brushing it for years without a change. The guy was definitely rushing me, he interrupted me every second and had a thick Indian accent. He only cared about the cavities I had which he could make some legitimate money on I guess ... Sooooo ... What do I do? I did some research and I'm assuming it's not a dead tooth, it doesn't hurt and I'd assume that dentist would love some root canal money if it was, and I don't see how it could be stained either because it grew in that way ... Also what is this white border,it's on the physical tooth not the gums, dental instruments don't scrape it off, brushing has done nothing to help and it's so unnaturally white that it pops from the rest of my teeth making it stand out and making my teeth look less white ... Please help, sorry the picture doesn't do it justice, just imagine it's significantly grayer\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t  and the white line is super bright Dentgr: You should go and check the vitality of the tooth.during the orthodontic treatment there's a possibility of pulp necrosis . If this is the case you'll need rct .\nWhite spots are there and on the surface of other teeth as well. You notice it more because of the higher contrast.\nIt seems to me that you may need a filling there because it looks cavitiated but really can't tell for sure through a photo.\nHope it helps."

    "dialogue": "impatient patient: I have a temporary acrylic bridge on teeth 7, 8  and 9. The middle part (8) broke. I came to this out-of-network dentist lured by a promise of a free 20-minute consultation.The dentist spent all the consultation time trying to upsell me into a massive \"crown lengthening\"  for cosmetic reasons on at least 6 teeth. I repeatedly said I am not interested, and he said: \"OK, it's your choice if you want to look like this\". No other dentist had ever suggested anything like that, and I honestly can't see where he is coming from.He did not answer any of my other questions on the grounds of not having the time.He did very quickly cement the broken part of the bridge, gluing it to 7 and 9. I wish he added antiseptic or something, because I fear infection.Here is the billSo, he attempted to bill $122 for palliative treatment which was declined by insurance. What palliative treatment? I was in no pain and did not ask for an urgent treatment.He also billed me for two \"recement crown\", $82 each. There were no crowns, just a bridge which he cemented to adjacent teeth with two dabs of cement.The whole thing took him maybe 10 minutes.Is this a fair bill?  Please help me with this, 'cause I am harassed by his front desk several times a day. Zuri Barniv: Why don't you contact the insurance company, tell them what happened and let them help you sort it out. impatient patient: Tried it. They ignored it.They offered me to fill in a Quality of Service Complaint Form, and short of that, they say they are not qualified.Is $286 a more or less appropriate amount for a quick temporary cementing job? Is it just me? Am I being unreasonable? Zuri Barniv: Well, the short answer is, yes, $286 is probably pretty reasonable to get you in, evaluate your problem, offer treatment options then reattach a broken piece of the temporary. But that is NOT what the dentist charged. He charged you for recementing two crowns and your portion is $118.40, the dentist got another $45.60 from Delta Dental. Delta Dental is not allowing the \"palliative treatment\" charge (see item 1 in the notes), so neither you nor Delta pay for that part. The dentist has to write off $122.It sounds like the chemistry with this dentist was not good so you need to find someone new. But to pay $118.40 for what you got is pretty fair in my book.\nDr. Barniv impatient patient: Thank you for your response Dr. Barniv! Maybe I'll just pay the guy tomorrow and forget about it.Still confused though: after a free 20 min consultation (which was useless to me, because his email is broken, so he could not receive my xrays), he spent 5 minutes cementing. I can maybe believe 5 minutes of his time is worth $164, but why did he also attempt to charge the insurance company $122 for palliative treatment? What palliative treatment could have been provided in these 5 minutes, given that I was not in pain? Does not it come across to you as an attempt to overcharge the insurance company? Yes, I know, it was declined, so no big deal, but just how trustworthy is the doc? Or is this common? I mean, if he spent 20 minutes..For comparison, in my city, $160 buys me a comprehensive perio evaluation with a periodontist (as per Delta). Why would 5 minutes with a non-specialist cost more than a comprehensive eval by a specialist? Zuri Barniv: impatient patient said:\t\t\tWhy would 5 minutes with a non-specialist cost more than a comprehensive eval by a specialist?\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Because actual treatment costs more than a consultation/exam. Think about it: if the fix he did fell off the next day, you would be right back in his office and he would most likely redo it for free on his own time using materials that do cost money. So part of what you are paying for is a little warranty that is not there when only an exam occurs. Yes, he billed it incorrectly, he was just trying to recover whatever money from the insurance he could for the time he spent. It is a game and it happens a lot. Most likely, a billing person made that decision and that person was probably not very experienced as Delta never pays for more than x-rays when palliative treatment is billed. So I would not focus so much on the actual line items and more on what is fair compensation for the service you received.  Hope that helps.\nDr. Barniv impatient patient: It does help. Thank you. I'll pay him tomorrow.I was also annoyed with the way his office wanted to have my credit card on file, so that they can automatically bill me for the balance after insurance, without sending me the bill first. I refused, because that's a little unusual, is not it? Then the front desk called me the same day the insurance payment came back, and kept calling me once or twice a day every day since. No grace period at all. Threatening to pass it to collections \"next Tuesday\".That aggressive accounting, coupled with aggressive upselling, is what had raised the red flags with me. Is this unusual? Zuri Barniv: That is not typical. Just pay him and move on...I wonder if you could have read some Yelp reviews before going and seen this coming? impatient patient: Yelp reviews were just fine. 5 reviews, average 4 stars, the one-star review complaining about long wait. Some of the 5-stars seem kind of cheesy, I don't know..  two additional reviews collapsed. Not much information..I'll do just like you said. impatient patient: Correction, FOUR reviews out of 9 collapsed by Yelp. That's unusual is not it? Zuri Barniv: What is a \"collapsed\" review? impatient patient: \"4 other reviews that are not currently recommended\""

Zuri Barniv: Waiting till you perceive a problem can result in a very bad long-term outcome. If nothing else, you may be living with a chronic, albeit low grade, infection for years. That alone can trigger countless medical conditions or aggravate existing ones. Your body does not deal well with chronic infections. Secondly, by the time you \"feel the need\" to do something, a lot of destruction around your gums and bone will have taken place. This means it will be more expensive, difficult or impossible to do an implant later on. You are better off taking out the affected tooth and doing an implant when you can afford it than to let it ride until it becomes unbearable. There is no way currently in dentistry to even temporarily fix a tooth which has a fractured root.\nDr. Barniv firegal: My friend was recently in the same boat. Dentist cracked her tooth during a root canal and told her that her only options were an extraction or implant (I think the quote was for ~$8,000!).

Namely where my teeth go behind my other teeth, which honestly was bound to happen since they were so far back behind the rest anyways and I still don't know how to keep them from yellowing because they are really hard to reach and kind of blocked.\nI need a lot of work done on my mouth basically, it would cost at least a few thousand without insurance, and that is the gum grafting surgery I looked into alone and not whatever else I will need which of course, I will need more. The problem is I am going to have to be the one paying for it, and I don't have insurance on myself yet. What insurance options would an 18 year old have that would be good coverage for me? As soon as I turn 18, I plan to begin my dental restoration journey. Any help would be appreciated.My second question is, is there a certain way I should approach this? I'm kind of scared of going to a dentist before a periodontist and  I'm completely on my own here. Not sure what to do and I really don't want to be berated for something I really couldn't help and I've heard bad stories before. I'm a really shy and anxious person and if anything keeps me from getting the help, it would be that.Now that I have grown up enough to realize what I need to do and why and because I'm almost an adult and able to help myself, I am ready to take the steps to get it all done."

    "dialogue": "ppzhao: I just had a dental implant completed, it's the lower left molar. From the extraction, I've been missing that tooth for almost a year now, and have been chewing solely on the other side of mouth. Now that I just got my lower left molar back, I tried chewing on it and it hurts the upper tooth that it's chewing against - almost like a sore tooth, doesn't hurt by itself, but hurts when you put pressure on it such as chewing.  It also isn't sensitive to temperature such as cold soda or hot soup.Also, the teeth next the upper molar aren't sore at all when I put pressure against them, even though I haven't chewed with them either.  I Googled it and saw that I may have a cracked tooth, but I think it's unlikely.  It was just fine when I stopped chewing with it due to the extraction of the lower molar, and I haven't used it for almost a year because there's no teeth for it to chew against.Is it normal? Is the upper tooth just \"spoiled\" from not being chewed with for a year? Will it no longer hurt to chew with it after a week or so of chewing? Or is this something not normal, and I should go back to the dentist?  I've been baring the pain and slowly chewing soft things like speghetti with it."

And this is the reason why I think the filling plays a part. The noise still exists.I dont drink. I don't take drugs. I am apart from the above occurrences of sound mind."

    "dialogue": "Tragedy18: A few days ago I started having a tooth ache. It was a constant ache over the two days but it wasn't sensitive to hot or cold drinks, in fact, in a sense it caused relief. Went to the dentist and my doctor said they will do an X-ray. She wasn't certain based on the X-ray but said based on my symptoms I needed a root canal. I'm midway through the process, the nerves were too painful to work on even after numbing it so my doctor applied medication to kill the nerve and we rescheduled. I can't help but feel amiss. After the first appointment, she gave antibiotic and painkillers but after two days I didn't need the painkillers anymore. I asked my doctor at my next appointment, that the pain was gone and was it still necessary, she said she had drilled too deep or something and we have to finish. Maybe the pulp was removed. I really don't know and a little confused.I'd like to know if this was absolutely necessary and were there other options? I remember the first visit, she said she would drill and check. After drilling, she said it seems very deep and I probably needed the root canal. Couldn't I have just taken the antibiotic and have the pain go away? She doesn't mention if the pulp or nerve is infected, is it not possible to see that when drilling? I'm sorry but this whole process is rather confusing and rather painful experience. I wanted some peace of mind, if it was avoidable or was it necessary. Thank you for reading, sorry if it was a bit too long. Zuri Barniv: An x-ray would be the only way anyone here could tell you if it was necessary or not. But assuming it was, once the dentist entered the canals of your teeth where the nerves are, then that cannot be remedied with antibiotics or anything else. Once a root canal is started, it needs to be finished or there would be long-term consequences.\nDr. Barniv Tragedy18: Zuri Barniv said:\t\t\tAn x-ray would be the only way anyone here could tell you if it was necessary or not.

How could she do it without being certain, it seems like a root canal will have some long term consequences. She did two X-rays and couldn't tell if there was anything. There was a black spot that appeared but she said that could be due to the ash from the X-ray. What are other options she could have presented if she was uncertain? I didn't feel like I had any choice but to agree to a root canal but it always felt like \"probably\" have to do it rather than a \"have to\" from her explanations.EDIT: I also read online that when you need a root canal, the antibiotics buys me a few weeks before it gets bad. I with the pain roughly 9 days ago, our next appointment is in 2 weeks. She's applied medication to kill the nerve because it was still very painful after numbing it 3 times. Isn't almost 4 weeks of leaving it incomplete, dangerous? Zuri Barniv: Sometimes dentists make a diagnosis on the totality of the evidence and different dentists will differ on what evidence is required to justify a root canal. If she was uncertain, she could have waited to see how your symptoms played out, but you would then suffer in pain all that time. So it's not always cut and dry. Yes, leaving a root canal unfinished could lead to an infection.

    "dialogue": "Shane999: Hello there.  I'm hoping some of you have some advice for my situation.I'm going to try and keep this as brief as I can.  Basically I went to two different dentists in the last month and have gotten different stories from them about a few things.  Let's start with \"Dentist 1\"My experience with Dentist 1:\nI went in for an exam because I want to have some cavities filled.  Within a few minutes of looking at my teeth she tells me a \"Deep Cleaning\" is absolutely necessary before we do anything else.  She tells me my fillings will be covered by my insurance but tells me the deep cleaning IS NOT covered.  I ask about the price of a deep cleaning, expecting to hear something reasonable, but instead she tells me it would be over $500!  After discussing this with her for some time, and telling her I'd need time to save up that kind of money to pay up front, I get her to \"admit\" that we can go ahead with the fillings without a deep cleaning.  She tells me, however, that if I come back for the deep cleaning AFTER I have the fillings done, any newly discovered cavities or issues would NOT be covered by my insurance so I'd have to pay out of pocket.  To me, this sounds like a scare tactic to make me frantically figure out a way to produce $500+ for the deep cleaning, which is what she's much more interested in (profit wise) than whatever my insurance would pay her for the fillings.  Also, I know for a fact my insurance DOES cover a deep cleaning as long as I haven't already had one in the last few years, which I haven't.  She blatantly lied about this to me, so I refused to even consider her for any of the work I need.  A friend of mine had a deep cleaning done there, and has the same exact coverage I have, and it was covered... so I know for a fact this dentist is aware my plan covers the deep cleaning.  (but I \"look\" like I have more money than my friend does, appearance/clothing wise)\nMy experience with Dentist 2:\nHe looks at my teeth and tells me I need the deep cleaning, but tells me my insurance WILL cover it.  (which I already know, but I'm glad he was honest about that unlike the previous dentist)  He warns me, however, that after a deep cleaning I might have some teeth that are permanently \"loose\" after they are done scraping away whatever materials have been building up between the teeth and gums.  I tell him I'd prefer to just go ahead with the fillings for now, and get those out of the way without a deep cleaning.  He then tells me he refuses to just do the fillings because \"they will all fall out right away\" if I don't have a deep cleaning first.  Even though the first dentist, who unfortunately was trying to scam me out of money, admitted that fillings COULD be done before the deep cleaning.So, as you can see, I have gotten to very different stories.  One dentist wants to scare me into paying her cash for a deep cleaning, but is OK with me getting the fillings first as long as I tell her I'm going to come back for the deep cleaning and pay cash.  The second dentist admits right away that the deep cleaning is covered, but tells me I might have loose teeth forever afterwards, so when I say I'd like to skip the deep cleaning he tells me he won't do it because the fillings would all fall out.Thoughts?  Advice?  Which dentist is the bigger liar/scammer here?  What do I need to do in order to have some simple fillings put in WITHOUT the risk of a deep cleaning causing me damage I wouldn't have had anyway?"

For example, if you're diagnosed with gingivitis.So let's take a closer look...Most mouthwashes contain four common ingredients: Water, Alcohol, Flavour & Colour. Looking beyond those common ingredients you can group mouthwashes into 4 general categories:\n- Antimicrobial (reduces bacteria)\n- Fluoride (helps slow & prevent tooth decay)\n- Astringent Salts (masks bad breath)\n- Odor Neutralizers (chemically inactivates odour causing bacteria)As mentioned above, people that suffer from gingivitis may benefit from an Antimicrobial and/or Fluoride mouthwash. If on the other hand, you don't suffer from any specific oral health issues, perhaps an Alcohol-Free Fluoride mouthwash can be a good alternative to slow and/or prevent tooth decay. If your simply looking to treat bad breath, I would recommend instead using a sugar-free chewing gum, preferably sweetened with Xylitol.  Hope this helps. Dr. Jennifer Thomm\nCosmetic Dentist\nGreat Lakes Dental\nSarnia, Ontario Canada Bill Goodwin: I've heard that there's a cult following that's grown up around the original orange Listerine, it's fabled as a cure all for many different - and not all to do with teeth - ailments.I've done a bit of Googling but I can't find whether its value lies in it being  and antimocrobial etc. mouthwash.I know that it feels as though it would take paint off a car though.Has anyone an answer to what it offers and has anyone else heard of its mythical qualities?"

I get there, all they know is that I have a tooth that \"hurts\", I had given no other details at that point, and they give me a \"permission to do a root canal\" sheet to sign. I was surprised and said \"What? Root canal?\" They said, \"Yeah, don't worry about it. It's just like getting a filling.\" Me being the wimp that I am I signed the sheet and let him do the root canal. After all, he's the doctor, right?So before he even looked inside my mouth he told me again, \"If you don't want to lose the tooth I have to do a root canal.\" I said OK. THEN he finally looked at it and did x-rays. \"Yeah, it looks like that cavity there is PROBABLY down to the nerve\"\n(It wasn't hurting at all at that point, and I couldn't see what he was talking about on the x-ray... Also, PROBABLY??? Yeah, let's do a root canal because you PROBABLY need one... lol)Anyway, after the fact, I was concerned and called my old dentist (family friend) and told him about it, and he said that was ridiculous and it could have just been filled and been fine, and it most likely didn't need a root canal.

So now I have another dead tooth in my mouth that will harbor even more harmful bacteria and god knows what, and just because this guy apparently wanted to make some money off of me....My grandmother has been using this guy for 35 years now, I can see why 3/4 of her teeth are missing.

This same dentist did a number of fillings on me, and none lasted 2 years. Usually, the free market will eventually weed these guys out, but it takes a while - the typical patient has very little basis on which to judge a dentist.The best thing you could do about it is post a negative online review of the practice somewhere online.

The standard of care is the level at which an ordinary, prudent dentist -- in good standing, and of same or similar educational background and geographic location -- would administer care under same or similar circumstances. This is simply the legal way of saying that your dentist has a duty to provide care at the same level a similarly educated dentist practicing in your area would provide.

Is this a normal method for these fillings or do I need to have them ground down smooth. I hate to question my dentists technique or whatever, so any help here would be great. Thanks Great Lakes Dental: Hi 2th, The situation you've described has become more common with the proliferation of white (tooth-coloured) fillings. In yesteryear's, when most Dentists still used amalgam (silver) fillings, imperfections (bumps, edges, lips etc) could be easily spotted. Since today's filling materials blend naturally into your teeth, it's more difficult to spot these imperfections. Patients won't notice during the initial filling appointment since they still have freezing in. Later, when the freezing wears off, you notice it either with your tongue or your bite feels off. I always tell patients to be aware that this can occur and to simply call us back (if necessary) and request an adjustment or smooth. Therefore, to answer your question. It's entirely common and yes, you should call your office and request a smooth....You'll be in & out in 5 minutes.

    "dialogue": "bcjch: Hi all,I'm curious what actions dentists and hygienists consider \"uncooperative\". I've been characterized that way by some.If the only good patient is one that lies still in the chair with a blank stare during a procedure, then I guess I'm a bad one. I could find ways to get through things like cleanings, at least up until now ... but my mouth is in chronic bad shape, and I often yowl when getting poked the wrong way. I tend to gag on the inserts used to take x-rays. When anesthetized for a procedure, I'm fine - but I never relax in a dentist's office and don't think I ever will.No doubt I'm a difficult patient. The providers I've asked all say that they've had worse, but then again, they may have to say that out of diplomacy, no matter what the truth is.At the moment, I also wonder if being considered \"uncooperative\" means it's time to look for a new dentist.So for you providers out there - well, anyone, really, but providers in particular - just what does \"uncooperative\" mean? And is it a hint I should find another dentist? Danny84: Hi, I think many Dentists should be prepared for patients like yourself, I don't find it a horrible experience but I do suffer with anxiety so I do worry about going to the Dentist but once I'm there I just let them do their thing really. Have you thought of getting general anaesthesia? You would feel alot calmer and more cooperative with the Dentist. A good Dentist will always talk to you and reassure you, they usually explain if you have any pain put your hand up and I will stop right away. If your Dentist is not like this then if it was me I would change Dentists right away but I would look into the general anaesthesia which may work for you. I hope you find the right Dentist and I'm sure they will answer your question for you. bcjch: General anesthesia is not a realistic possibility for me. The dentist I'm at charges $1000 for IV sedation and only has the qualified guy come there once a month. Because I take prescription meds for other things, I'm told oral sedation is out because of possible interactions. N2O is, too, for the same reason - and a past incident. (Not entirely sure it was the cause, that dentist could have been better - but my doctor told me that kind of interaction is possible.)For the last cleaning, I had them numb me by injection, as they would for a filling or something. The hygienist was noticeably happy - said I was sooooooooooooooooooooo much more cooperative. I can't tell if that means they only want to deal with more sheeplike patients. If I'm the cause of the worst days of their life, maybe that's the case. Danny84: I'm always shocked at how much prices are so high in the USA, I'm assuming your from the USA anyway? I live in the UK and the prices are nowhere near that unless you go private of course. If I want a filling or root canal treatment it will cost me £51 which comes with general anaesthesia if wanted. All Dentists will want their patients cooperative, they are working in an area where sudden movement could cause harm to yourself. When I had my filling a week ago the worst part for me was just getting the needle into the gum which turned out ok in the end and once it was numb I just lay there for them to do their work.If your really uncomfortable with Dentists I would suggest to have a good chat with him/her and let them know how you feel after all you are paying them for treatment. There are Dentists on this forum, maybe they will get around to answering your question and give you their views as I am not a Dentist but I wish you well. bcjch: Yes, I'm in the USA. Apparently we're the only place in the world where Conan the Hygienist prowls dentists' offices ..."

I took painkiller to calm down the pain but after skydiving my teeths are sensitive to cold water and pain is coming back during night. I read about this online but couldn't find any solution.  I also read its related to barotrauma.  Should I go and see my physician or my dentist or pain will go away on its own.  Please help. Ak1: Pain was gone after 3 days.  I took 1 ibuprofen when pain starts.\nI also checked with one of my friend who is a doctor. He also told me to take ibuprofen for the pain and pain will go in few days by himself.I hope this reply will help others."

    "title": "Shooting pain after filling",
    "dialogue": "Danny84: Hi I'm new here and just wanted some advice really.I was having toothache for awhile and plucked up the courage of getting it seen to, I had a feeling it was a cavity anyway. The Dentist took x ray and said you have a cavity like you suspected but it is a deep one and close to the nerve. He talked me through what he would do and said i'll put a filling in there but it is deep and if I have any trouble you can ring us. So I had the filling on Monday morning and thought that might be the end of it but I'm getting this shooting pain, like a jolt when I touch the tooth or catch it in my mouth and it's an unpleasant feeling I'm guessing this is the nerve inside but I would of thought it would have settled down by now.How long do I give it to give them a ring do you think? My own opinion is I think I need root treatment and I wondered why they couldn't have done this in the first place instead of filling a deep cavity, is there a reason they don't go down that option? It would save alot of hassle and time in the long run if they just took the root out then fill it. Has anyone had this problem?Thanks\nDanny Great Lakes Dental: Hi Danny, From the story you've recounted, it sounds as though your Dentist has recommended & performed the correct treatment. Where appropriate, a Filling is a better initial option then a Root Canal. A Filling allows much of your natural, living tooth to remain - less the decayed portion that is removed & filled by your dentist. A Root Canal (as it sounds, involves removing the blood vessels, nerves & pulp tissue) which leaves your tooth feeling pain-free, but its' now no longer living. As a consequence your dead tooth will require a Crown to protect it's remaining, brittle structure.Since your Dentist recommended and performed a filling, that indicates that he/she believes that he/she can save your tooth.....You should be happy and thankful since the treatment your Dentist has recommended is both: better for your wallet and your long-term oral health. Now in terms of your discomfort, think about this way. Imagine having someone drill a hole through your femur bone, fill it with a foreign material and send you on your way. In those circumstances, would expect the pain to be gone in 48 hours? Certainly not! As your Dentist explained, your root canal was deep (and therefore close to the nerve), that means that every time your tooth comes into contact, the material is putting pressure on your nerve (causing a sharp pain). The pain that you're experiencing will subside, but it could take days, weeks or in some cases months. If you notice an infection (swelling, bleeding, puss, bad taste or foul odour occurring inside your mouth), at that point go back and have him/her take another look. I have several short videos on my website that may help you better visualize what's happening: http://greatlakesdental.ca/dental-videos/#dentistryHope this help. Dr. Jennifer Thomm\nCosmetic Dentist\nGreat Lakes Dental\nSarnia, Ontario Canada Danny84: Thanks for replying to my message it's much appreciated.I've had a filling before and i've never had any pain when the numbness wore off which made me think it might be something different, I was expecting the pain to go away quite quickly. I will give it more time and see if it eases up over the next week or two.I'm going to check out your website on that information, thanks again for explaining it.Danny Great Lakes Dental: Hi Danny, I thought I'd follow-up and see if you were still experiencing pain or sensitivity on your tooth?

So sad but true. Hope the lions get them. KennyLL: I did some checking on dental insurance. Not really any bargains that I found anyway. An average coverage for a family of three is a premium of $125-150/mo., $100 deductible , and $1000 max payout. With that said after paying out around $1500 a yr in premiums, any major dental work is still going to cost a substantial amount of out of pocket money. Normally all we ever have is your everyday dental visits for a cleaning a couple times a year. Better off just paying without any insurance .

I wonder if it's a similar situation for an individual, if one is just better off paying without insurance if it's just one big job you're interested in.Actually, I'm pretty ignorant regarding how insurance works at all, anyway. What exactly is a \"deductible\", \"premium\" and \"max payout?\" And can you get help right away after just paying the monthly fee? Are there some kind of barriers to entry like credit rating? Man, being an adult sucks, haha.It does seem that for a family you'd probably be better off without it though if usually you just need cleanings, I think. KennyLL: Insurance can be very confusing. Probably because the more confusing they can make it, the less they have to pay out.\n  A deductible is an amount that you have to pay(excluding your monthly premium) before the insurance pays anything. Premium is your monthly bill or amount that you ( or your employer) pay to the insurance company. Max payout is the most the insurance will pay.\n   Give an example:  say you need some major dental work done  ( like my 20 yr old) costing $5000. You pay the first $100(deductible) leaving a $4900 balance. Insurance picks up the next $1000 leaving you with the remaining balance of $3900. \n   I think a lot of these plans are designed for an employers to pay part of the premium and the employee to pay part. The plans that I've looked at so far don't make ant math sense at all. Also many of these dental plans have  6 -12 month waiting period before they would make a max payout.

I floss and brush everyday and I just recently started oil pulling. I was diagnosed with the beginning stages of periodontal disease a few years ago and I did have a deep cleaning/scaling done. I stopped going after that. Please don't lecture me, I know I shouldn't have stopped but I did continue to brush religiously and floss. I have an appointment booked for 11/13 with a new dentist ( I don't think mine was that honest) and I want to start taking even better care of myself. I have literally been obsessing over my teeth lately. Even started reading \"Cure tooth decay\" and taking cod liver oil everyday. I think the yellow stuff literally just started spreading to other teeth over the last few days since I have been obsessing. I also think there is some pus or something in between my teeth, but I cannot tell. I have no pain at the moment other than a few weeks ago I did have some in my jaw, so I bought a night guard and it went away. My gums are not inflamed as far as I can tell.  Do my teeth look doomed? Should I try and get the appointment booked for sooner? Does it look like this discoloration can be fixed? Why is this coating spreading along to the two teeth next to the ones in the front there? Dentgr: That's tartar build up. Nothing to panic about. Just go to your scheduled appointment Ryan2240x: Ok, so to follow up here I got into the dentist sooner and they told me about my periodontal disease. They kept reading off the #'s and I believe they even said some were as deep as 5 and 6 mm. I am so scared right now. They told me that I wouldn't lose my teeth today or tomorrow, but could start having problems in 5 years or so. I told them that I wanted to treat it NOW and I am booked to come in this coming Wednesday for scaling root planning, and I believe laser therapy, but it still isn't surgery they said. I still don't understand what exactly the laser would do. Afterwards, I will do my routine check ups every 3 months. Is there any hope for me? Can they even get into the pockets that are 5 and 6 mm? They said that it's good to catch this now and take action, otherwise I would need surgery down the road. Should I just get the surgery now? Are they lying to me and will I eventually need other treatments like surgery, or implants?"

Initially, I suspected I had bit the side of my cheek, yet the pain has not subsided after nearly a week and upon closer examination, I see that a wisdom tooth is coming in on that side. After doing a quick google search, I fear that I may have a partially \"impacted tooth\". I've attached a few photos below, please lend any wisdom (no pun intended) you may have. Thanks!!!!!!!\nThe first image is of the right side of my mouth, where I'm having no issue, & the wisdom tooth is still below the gum. The following two are of the left side where I am experiencing pain and swelling. Zuri Barniv: You have what's called \"operculitis\" or \"pericoronitis\" which is when the top tooth bites on a sensitive fold of gum laying over the lower wisdom tooth. Sometimes, removing the top wisdom tooth is what solves the problem, but usually removing both top and bottom is the best choice. Otherwise, antiseptic rinses and antibiotics may clear it up. But even if it clears up, the problem may come back throughout your life until you remove the source of the problem."

    "title": "Lots of Pain ARGH!",
    "dialogue": "thermionicvalver: Hello I am new here and would maybe like to ask some questions to see if I or the Dr were out of line. Or maybe both. A little background details. I am 34, I went to the same dentist until I was in my mid twenties. I moved away for about 7 years and didn't really have any issues with my teeth but had a couple random cleanings, I would say 3 in that 7 year period. My parents and I have always done what the dentist recommended and I have always had regular cleaning since I was a child. I also take pretty good care of my teeth, I brush well and rinse, I try to floss daily but it's more like a few times a week. When I was in Las Vegas last October I had a filling break out of my tooth from eating something. I new I was moving back to the East coast within a week so I would just wait to see a dentist. Well I wasn't even home a week when the tooth became infected and so I went to see my childhood dentist, whom didn't see me. No big deal the new dentist was very nice and told my my tooth was infected and that I needed a root canal. He gave me a referral, antibiotics, and some pain medication. I went to see the oral surgeon and he gave me a very large number for an estimate, $1500 without the crown. My insurance doesn't cover the procedure but I was told that I should try and save the tooth and not extract it. It's a molar, R3 and I use it to chew a lot. I told them that I would need to save up that sort of money and they didn't offer to do any payment plans. I work but barely make enough to keep up with bills, I just can't seem to save enough money. I don't want this to turn into a financial lecture, I don't grossly spend money on things I shouldn't, I am conservative. So almost a year goes by without another flair up, until two nights ago. I usually avoid chewing on that side of my mouth but I messed up. I am mainly a vegetarian, I eat a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables, along with beans and rice etc....BUT I treated myself to some chicken thighs that I bbq on the grill and they came out so good that I just couldn't help myself chewing and bam, instant excruciating pain. I mean I have had a pneumothorax and pancreatitis in the past two years, not to mention a herniated disk crushing my sciatic nerve,  and this pain was right up there or worse. I mean throbbing and screaming sharp pains non stop for two nights. It's really not even the tooth it's my jaw above the tooth and my face, I can't really open my mouth. I can't sleep, it's horrible. This morning I call the doctors office and they say they had a cancellation for 8am and they can see me. I was happy they could see me so soon. I honestly had the intention of going in there to tell them to just pull the thing out. In my early twenties I had similar infections for a wisdom tooth that they eventually extracted. The assistant took an x-ray and the doctor said that I have a real bad cavity and that I needed a root canal a year ago. I said I know but I haven't been able to come up with the money and that I am thinking of just pulling it. She told me that she wouldn't do it and referred me to an oral surgeon down the street. They told me to just walk down there and they would call  and send over the x-ray. I figured this was strange that they would refer me to a surgeon for an extraction but I don't really care who does it as long as it gets done. So I go down to the oral surgeons office where they tell me they are swamped and the doctor has two surgeries booked today (Friday). They set me up an appointment for Monday. I asked what am I to do until then, I mean it is really bothering me and I am thinking of just ripping it out myself it's that bad. They told me not to do that. Anyway I went back to talk to my dentist and I was met with hostility. This is actually the daughter of my original dentist, she practiced under him for years and now has bought the business. Basically I went in and told the girls at the front desk that I was under the impression that this tooth could get pulled today and that they actually set me up for next week. I don't no if what I have is considered an emergency but it sure feels that way to me, I can't eat and I am in extreme amounts of pain. I asked if nobody can see me can I get some antibiotics and something for the pain. The doctor came out and pretty much went up one side of me down the other. I was told that I had a cavity 11 years ago that never got treated because of me. I had to correct her and say no I had a filling there but it fell out last year. She then said that since I failed to get a root canal within a year it's my fault I am in the situation I am in and that she didn't want to help me. I was confused. She continued to tell me that I don't come in for enough cleanings and that I only call for emergencies. Ah hello I wasn't living around here for 7 years and I have only called in two emergencies in the past year. Sorry but deciding to spend around $3k to fix an important tooth or having it pulled isn't a light decision. If I had expendable cash I would just try the root canal and hope it works. At this point I just want it out and they same to not be able to help me with that, well I have to suffer a few days until then. She ended up giving me tylenol 3 and amoxicillin. I continued to get lectured by the girls in the front desk that I can't expect to have the world jump for me in an emergency because I failed to take care of my own teeth. Her and the doctor both said \"you only come here for emergencies\" several times. I then asked who do I call for a dental emergency? I am so confused. Isn't the dentist there for that exact purpose? I am willing to have to wait for the procedure but at the very least have some bedside manner and make me comfortable. I am in a lot more pain than I was a year earlier. I get, let me know that I should have taken care of this sooner, and yes I get it I need more cleanings but I feel I shouldn't be treated differently. I felt so tired and out of it from the pain that my mother took me so I didn't have to drive. She couldn't believe how they talked to me. She hasn't been going to them for the past 15 years so I guess that tells me something. I am switching dentists. I really just can't believe how I was treated, I feel like they didn't want to help me and that she somehow took it personal that I haven't been in several years. I feel I shouldn't have to explain that I moved away and recently moved back, it's none of their business. I think they just want to do cleanings and general practice and have moved away from the nitty gritty part of dentistry. Maybe for liability purposes I don't know. If that's the case I don't care just point me in the right direction. It's just strange that a dentist won't pull a tooth. I remember when I had the wisdom tooth extracted, it took like 15 minutes, I pulled out a couple hundred dollars and we were both happy with the transaction. But getting someone to help me out while I am in severe pain is like pulling teeth  Thanks for reading I would like some professionals and patients opinions on the matter. Va2nd: i sympathize with you, i am no dentist but i've been treated in similar ways and, eventually had to go to the er to get antibiotics. I would reccomend you find another dentist personally. Hope things improve for you."

    "dialogue": "seanincali: I just got back from a second general dentist (I have medi-cal or denti-cal which has very limited access to dental care) I've seen in two days. The first one from yesterday, told me that I needed two root canals, and that I have 3 options. 1. do nothing. 2. Root canals, but pay it out my own pocket because the denti-cal doesn't cover it. 3. Extract it. I told him I can't afford it and i'll do nothing about it. Then he asked me if I wanted my teeth cleaned, and I said yes. So he proceeded clean the teeth and as he was cleaning, he dug out a hole in the tooth on the left.\nThat's the before the cleaning picture.This is after. \nSee the gap in the after picture? That wasn't there before. Now I didn't realize he was going to do it, and I got upset, because now I have a hole in my tooth that needs the root canal. So I asked for xrays before and after to file a complaint and called the denti-cal office to which they suggested that I talk to the doctor to see if he will make it right. But I realized today there was another clinic in town that takes denti-cal so I went in to get a consultation, and found out they DO take medi-cal as payment. After I explained to him all the troubles I had with the other dentist at a different clinic yesterday, he explained that cleaning drills cannot penetrate the enamel to do that much digging. And then after examination and another xray, he told me the nerves in the tooth that needs the root canal is too thin for him to do the procedure himself. And that I needed to see an endodontist.Here's picture of the tooth, but it barely show the nerves.\nIs there a truth in what he's saying about the nerves being too thin? I just don't trust him on the issue. This is an issue for me because the first dentist I saw told me I needed root canals that he was going to do it, and he was a general dentist. Now the second dentist, after I complained to him about the first, now decides that even though he's the only option I have to get the root canal done, is saying he's not capable of doing it. (He works at a clinic that takes medi-cal as payment for root canals) And I asked him what happens if I just get the hole filled, and he told me that will cause pain. So I made a third appt tomorrow to see if the third dentist will be able to do a root canal on it. Are these people telling the truth? And if so how should I approach the third? \nThank you for any insights"

    "title": "Huge fear, appointment booked, help.",
    "dialogue": "Scared: Hi, I found these forums whilst looking for something to help me feel a little less anxious, as a child I was always scared of going to the dentist, my parents never really addressed these fears and would instead drag me to my 6 monthly appointment. When I was younger I didn't really understand good oral hygiene\nrequirements and was scared to even brush my teeth, massive phobia of anything in my mouth even the toothbrush ect. Since being a teenager 14 onwards I have maintained good oral hygeine, flossing and burnishing 3 times a day, I last saw the dentist  8  years ago when I was 18 and had no problems, since moving out of my parents house and not being forced to go the fear has grown and grown, my partner has convinced me to book an appointment with a dentist who is a friend of his family and it safe to say I am petrified, can anyone offer and support or advise? I'm so scared of walking into the waiting room, into the room, sitting on the chair, lying back and opening my mouth, all these things are a 10/10 fear level not to mention if I need anything doing. I have no pain and not have I ever had pain in teeth or gums ect but it petrified I may need wisdom to be removed, I'm 25 and two of them are only half out. I'm also concerned about the small chips at the bottom of the front teeth, does this mean I have weak teeth? Will something need doing. I've attached a picture of my smile, do they look drastically bad to you? Scared: Any tips on calming down before visit would be great too. Sick of the sleepless nights because of the panic. dentistgirl: I don't see why you should worry before seeing the dentist. It doesn't seem you need an extraction or so  just relax, and think that if you wait too long to see the dentist it will be worse in the future. My only tip is don't think too much about it... Zuri Barniv: Fear of the dentist is very common. Sometimes it is comforting to know you are not alone and dentists are very used to it. You need to make sure your next experience is a very good one and consider finding a dentist who has a special interest in working with especially fearful people. These dentist can make you an appointment to just come in and sit in the reception area or tour the office without doing anything at all. The next appointment is for you to come and sit in the chair and read a magazine for 10 minutes and leave without doing anything. It may take several more appointments before he/she can just look in your mouth. It takes a special kind of dentist to do something like that, but building trust with such a dentist could change you life. At the very least, I would call a prospective dentist to talk to him on the phone and discuss how you are feeling. If he brushes you off or doesn't have time to even chat on the phone, there is a small chance he will be much more patient when you come in.There are also medications to help reduce your anxiety which can be very helpful. I wish I could tell you your teeth are fine, but without x-rays and a much better look at the inside of your mouth, the only thing that can be said is that they look fine from a distance.\nHope that helps."

    "title": "Question that may seem strange.....",
    "dialogue": "Mom2015: Like many I have a major phobia of dentists that started when I was very young.   To try to avoid braces they pulled a few teeth.  According to my mother, a few without novican as I was afraid of the shot.  Well I ended up with braces anyways.  But I had my 4 wisdom teeth out as a teen. LOL my parents failed to remember to plan this early in our summer holiday so I ended up flying for 3 days long haul international within a week of having them out.  We lived as expats in SE Asia.   Fast forward, many years.... Okay wisdom teeth out in the mid-late 80's.  I can't remember if it was 2000 or 2003 but when I was pregnant with one of my last two kids my very back molar needed attention.  I had morning sickness 24/7 so the very idea of going through a root canal made me gag at the thought.  I dont think it could have been done safely so I opted to pull it instead.  Life went on....Now this past weekend I had terrible pain on my lower right side.  Out of my mind type pain when a root is exposed kind of pain.  Because of pancreatic cancer and surgery and my body had gone through extreme trauma recovering.  (Highly recommend mayo clinic, Rochester mn). That has left my dealing with chronic pain, fibromyalgia.  I have dealt with this two other times.  I thought I needed to call the dentist Monday morning.  Why does this always happen on a weekend.  But come Monday it was like it never happened.  So because I went from severe surgical pain to chronic pain only one pain medication worked for me so I have been on it about 5 years.  No I don't abuse, take less if I can (half dose) and then go up to full dose as needed.  Sometimes I can do that, other times not.  But I have read where others with fibro have this phantom dental pain that has no cause behind it. So that is what got me through the severe pain.  But then it also clicked in, that where it was hurting was that very back molar that was pulled.But get this, now its either 14 or 11 years later and I feel something there.  I can feel a sharp point at the top and behind it looks like something dark and oval.  But its flush with the gums.   It woke me up in the wee hours of the morning this morning.  And using pretty much just Tylenol and orajel I felt something new.  From the side of my gums, the side facing my cheek is now another sharp pointy thing.  I have read where fragments left behind can surface months later.  Sometimes years or never.  But this has been 11 to 14 years.  Just hurts and really strange since I had my wisdom teeth out years ago and that back molar pulled such a long time ago.  It still hurts, but not as bad as it did this weekend. I really hate to go into the dentist if its not needed. Any thoughts about what these sharp pointy things may be that are coming out the top and side of my gums.  Where the tooth was extracted?"

It's been over a week since I got the braces removed from my top teeth.One tooth in particular, my upper left front tooth, #8, has been really sensitive for about 4 months now. I always assumed it was related to the braces. Even when I still had the braces on the tooth felt odd, a little loose even. I thought it was just related to my teeth being adjusted.Well, now the tooth is still sensitive and it's hurting. Last Thursday night I started to notice it feeling loose. I can't even touch the tooth gently without it hurting.  I can't eat properly.  I can't bite into anything.I'm really scared and I'm not sure what's wrong. I called my dentist's office last Friday and they said to call my Orthodontist first.  I don't know why.  My dentist's office said they could get me in on Tuesday if I need to. The Orthodontist's office is closed on Fridays, so I left a voice mail.  The tooth has felt really loose all weekend and it's worrying me a lot.  I'm still wearing my retainer, but I'm afraid it's making the tooth get looser.I don't know what to do. Should I try and wait this out or will it get worse over the weekend?

    "dialogue": "bpotter: I have a had a bridge for three years, it spans two teeth and is connected to three teeth.  Something didn't feel right so off to the dentist with me.  The most rear (last tooth) was broken under the crown.  The bridge had to be removed and the tooth pulled.  Dentist said all my other teeth and crowns looked good, but I probably didn't take good care of the one that broke as it was so far back in my mouth.I never had tooth pain, and the x-ray looked like a clean break.  I don't remember biting down on anything as I baby this bridge. It cost me 4K.  How can this happen?  When I arrived home I see that it looks like she left the root and I wonder how much problem that will be? It's on my gum line.I also had a bad tooth, farthest molar back, bottom left.  I talked about it with her.  Told her I had been on antibiotics for an unrelated cause and it cleared up the abscess I had in that tooth, but that I couldn't chew on it etc. without pain.  I was very clear about identifying this tooth saying I didn't have a matching tooth above it so I thought I could afford to lose it.  She took x-rays and said she would pull it.So I was numb both sides of my mouth and my tongue was completely numb.When I got home to change the dressing, I see she pulled the tooth next to my bad tooth, one I wouldn't have wanted to lose at all.  It would have been worth a root canal, crown, whatever was needed.I call and talked with her telling her she pulled the wrong tooth!  She told me it had a large cavity so she pulled it, to be assured it was pretty bad.  She also said if the one originally bothering me was still a problem to come back in two weeks after I heal and she will pull it also.So, I effectively lost three teeth on my bottom right with the bridge loss, no teeth left to anchor to to create a new bridge. Now I have also lost a molar on the left and I'm sure the bad one will still have to be removed.  The one on the left looks like she left some root there also.My problem is, she didn't say \"I am not going to pull the tooth you said was the problem, but instead pull one you didn't know there was a problem with\" She didn't talk it over with me at all or give me any options.  It was such a shock when I saw it in the mirror.  Now I won't have any molars on either side and guess I am looking at dentures as I can't afford implants.Are the root pieces she left going to be an issue?  And I suspect it was a mistake that she pulled the wrong tooth on my left side and won't admit it.I figure I'll get a copy of my x-rays and a second opinion, even though I can't afford that...I have no dental insurance.  And I will still have to have the bad tooth pulled.Nothing I do will replace my lost teeth but what recourse do I have?  What can I do...so very frustrated!!!Any advice would help.  I am in pain and at a total loss as to what to do. Thank you!"

    "title": "13 days post op implant and bone graft",
    "dialogue": "Ngates1974: In January, I cracked my crown on a tooth I had a root canal on 10 years ago. I went to the dentist where a new crown was placed. Prior to the new crown being placed I had absolutely no issues with this tooth. Shortly, after the crown was placed the tooth began feel strange when I would chew on it, like it was high or swollen. I went back to the dentist several times where he assured me that the crown was placed perfectly and I should be having no issues. In May, I made another appointment because it still did not feel right. This time I was told that I had a cavity in the tooth in front of it. That was fixed. Mind you, while all this was going on after my crown was placed it was drilled down too much and there was a gap in between the new crown and the tooth in front of it. I constantly had food getting stuck in between these two teeth. I did make another appointment and the dentist added composite to the tooth in front of the new crown so there was no longer a gap. In June, I went back again, this time the dentist tells me there is an infection below the tooth under the root. He sends me home with Clindamycin which never cleared it up. I finally made an appointment with an emergency dental doctor on a Saturday and he informed me that the tooth needed to be removed, he then said however make an appointment with an endo and make sure it cant be saved. I made an appointment with an endo and he said that the tooth was fractured and needed to be removed. I then made an appointment with my general dentist to have the tooth extracted after the endos suggestion. The dentist had a terrible time removing it, he stated that the tooth had a hook on it and was deeply attached to the bone. It took this man 25 minutes of drilling and pulling and using all kinds of tools to get the broken pieces of root out. He then placed the implant and bone graft right after the tooth extraction, with the infection still in the bone. He stated it would be fine and the infection should go away on its own. A couple days after it didnt feel right, I went to my dentist and he prescribed me penicillin VK 500mg PO QID. I finished the antibiotics and i still had this very strange hard lump on the left side of my bone next to the implant. I made another appointment and he stated I really dont know what that is, the bone graft looks good, theres no infection around the implant, however theres some strange darkening color in the bone on the xray that he couldnt rule out was infection or nerves. He prescribed me clindaymin once again 300mg po QID X 7 days. On Friday the area still felt odd, I am not having a lot of pain, it is more like strange sensation in my jaw bone and occasional throbbing inside the hole where the implant is. I am terrified of osteomyelitis or an infection in the bone that is not osteomyelitis that just never cleared up. I went to the ER Friday evening and the ER doctor told me that if I had osteomyelitis Im pretty sure I would know it by now. He suggested I continue taking my clindamycin and go back for more xrays to compare a now and before. I am concerned mainly about the hard lump on outter L side of my lower jaw adjacent to where the implant was placed and the minimal swelling around the tooth in front where the implant was placed. Occasionally I will get this sharp pain inside the hole where the implant is, some minor throbbing in the area and itching on my jaw area. Any idea what is going on here? Or am I over reacting to symptoms of the area healing?"

Zuri Barniv: I wish it were so easy. Full dentures, especially if not expertly fabricated and adjusted can give you a lifetime of misery, eating nothing but mush and remembering fondly the days you still had teeth. Dentures are terrible and should only be made if it is a last resort. If those dentures were held in with implants, that is a different story. But I don't think that is the route you are fantasizing about. caffeinated22222: Dentures held in with implants sounds good to me skipaheartbeat: Coming from someone with implants, they are far from low maintenance although I'm eternally grateful for them as I had a congenital hypodontia and hated my dentures. They were , as the dentist above described also far from low maintenance and very painful. Caused bad breath also as the acrylic nature of them made for unpleasant smells after eating or with a dry mouth.  And I can vouch for the utter misery of ill fitting dentures, not forgetting they require replaced or repaired when broken  (not uncommon btw). Also for a younger person like me I also hated the stigma. It's not an easy route!! caffeinated22222: Hi,\nthanks for your reply.\nWhat is young..roughly\nDo you now have implants or dentures?.\nI have one lower front denture currently with four teeth and it fits like a glove and I really like it and appreciate it.\nI am presuming all the succes stories,would not be here ,as those people have no need to come back to the forum.\nARE THERE ANY POSITIVE STORIES OUT THERE OF PEOPLE HAPPY WITH THEIR FULL DENTURES?\nOtherwise one could presume a conflict of interest,coming from a dentists mouth {excuse the pun} Zuri Barniv: Before I started my own practice, I worked in a retirement home so I have seen THOUSANDS of patients with dentures. You will be hard pressed to find someone with more perspective on dentures than me, so let me lay it out for you: They are terrible overall, but full lower dentures must have been invented by the devil himself, because they almost never feel or function well. When dentures are held in with implants, the story changes, but implants are expensive. A denture held in with implants in the USA can run anywhere from $5,000 to $60,000 depending on a variety of factors. My advice, based on admittedly very little info about your case, is to consider a full upper denture but hold on to every lower tooth like it was made of diamonds. Stay out of a full lower denture at all costs unless you are 100% sure you will have it held in with implants. Of course there are success stories, but they are much more common when people have a combination full upper denture and PARTIAL lower denture. skipaheartbeat: Totally agree with above re lower denture. I spent a lot of my youth trying to get away without it but as a teen I just suffered the pain. But I never ever could eat with it in and as a result had one very embarrassing moment in a restaurant where I had hid it descretely in a tissue only to have the waitress whip it away with my finished dinner. This, along with other reasons, all led me to the point of starting the process of implants. It's been a long process but totally worth it. However the reason I am on this forum is that one of my crowns fell out yesterday and as it's a weekend I can't get hold of my dentist,  I am concerned my gum will close over the implant socket, by the time I get to see my dentist to refit the screw in crown. So my point is nothing is maintenance free! P's I am 41 years young.. But I started the process of implants at 25. skipaheartbeat: P's I have a combination... Maryland bridges on lower two teeth that were only two of lower jaw that developed. These were  put in when I was 20 years old (amazingly have lasted that long!!) However I had a denture for entire rest of my lower jaw until I got implants. I now have 4 implants that retain lower dentures. My upper jaw is a little more complex but almost the same. I have 4 of my own teeth that have not fully developed so are veneered and 5 implants retaining a combination of dentures and crowns. caffeinated22222: O.K,\nI understand more clearly now,I will retain my lower teeth like diamonds\nMuch appreciated"

    "dialogue": "skipaheartbeat: Hi. I have several implants fitted due to congenital hypodontia. These range from 10 years to 2 years old. The crown from a 10 year old implant has just unscrewed it's self from a back molar. The implant itself feels fine. Also the crown and screw both look undamaged. However I'm concerned with it being the weekend and being unable to get my dentist, that the gum will close up over the implant entry at gum level.  Can anyone advise or reassure this is ok for a few days? Thanks in advance. Zuri Barniv: If the gums heal over the implant for a few days it is totally not a big deal. Worst case scenario you would need to be numbed a little and it would be re-exposed so the crown can be put back on. My experience has been that if you put the crown back on, you really need to thoroughly recheck the bite. Usually a loose screw indicates excessive loads on the crown in relation to other teeth. Also, it would be STRONGLY advised NOT to reuse the same screw when putting it back on. Most screws from 10 yrs ago were made from gold or a gold alloy. When they get screwed in the first time, the screw deforms and it is permanently changed. If you reuse it, the likelihood of it loosening again are higher. Hope that helps. skipaheartbeat: Much much appreciated it's been worrying me! I can totally cope with the gum being reopened if required. It was recently changed (the crown and screw) so I'm fairly sure it is a new type of screw. I have bruxism on top of all the other issues so my bite is an issue. I have a splint to help with this. My gut feeling is the screw wasn't adequately torqued on last appointment as my dentist had to leave for a lecture and left it in the hands of his senior house officer. (It's a UK dental hospital ). Many thanks again Zuri Barniv: Don't know what a senior house officer is, but you've been dealing with this long enough to know what's what. Newer screws are usually made of titanium and can be rescrewed a couple of times. Still, insist they double check your bite when they do it. The most important thing to check is that when you grind your teeth from side-to-side there is absolutely zero contact on the implant crown with any other teeth. Hits from the side tend to loosen screws. Implants are most robust when receiving vertical pressures only. skipaheartbeat: Brill thank you. My dentist is usually really good at checking my bite...He even sent me for hypnosis to try to counteract the bruxism. He's a great dentist and I am very lucky to have this treatment on our national health service (no cost to me). Senior house officer is just one level below consultant. Usually graduated approximately 5 to 6 years.  I'm almost positive he said it was a titanium screw."

This was all in April.\nAfter my classes finished I looked for another dentist to perform my regular cleaning and I complained my wisdom tooth (upper right) was aching and I was getting food stuck there and it was hard to clean. I thought I was going to have it removed.\nThe new dentist took X-rays and told me I have several cavities and that the problem was not my wisdom tooth but the molar next to it. She showed me the X-ray with a big stain and said:\n- \" you have a HUGE cavity inside this tooth and you will probably need a crown and there is a chance you will loose this tooth\".\nThe thing is, she could not work on it because she was going on vacation and the next available appointment would be in a month and a half from now. I was in pain and I had a trip scheduled two days after so, I cancelled the trip (I lost a plane ticket) and I looked for another dentist that could see me right away.\nI will need a root canal and a crown on this molar but I will not loose it. This dentist told me that even if the previous dentist had missed it on the X-rays, it was possible to see it in the cleaning and regular check-ups.\nI am now on antibiotics, pain killer and I have an appointment to see an endodontist on Monday. This was a huge cavity.\nThe two other dentists I saw told me that this cavity has been there for a while (at least 4 years). It did not develop it in a year or so, and remember, I was there in April for my last visit!\nI brush my teeth after every meal; I floss once a day and I go to the dentist 3 times a year.\nThe list of adjectives keep growing about this previous dentist : irresponsible, negligent, unethical, lazy, dishonest, disrespectful...\nThis is not the only cavity I have now but because of this poor job (poor was written because I what I really wanted to) I missed a trip, a lot the money for the airline ticket and I will have to pay for a job that could have had an easier fix.\nWhy? Why would he do this? Is it money? Is it because he gets more money treating a root canal and a crown than just a mere cavity? I am at a lost at what to think about this nonprofessional dentist... JJ_8613: Hi.I'm sorry you went through all this.  I agree with you that this dentist sounds negligent.  It's up to you, but it may be worth reporting him.  If nothing else maybe you could get compensated.Also, I just want to mention that this site has a lot of information and members who can give you more information than I can.

    "dialogue": "JJ_8613: Hi.I'm currently nearing the end of adult orthodontics treatment. I will be getting the braces off any time now. My dentist recently told me, during a regular exam, that I have 3 teeth showing signs of external root resorption.The office has current x-rays and if that's helpful I will request and post them.I'm concerned because my dentist tells me that we're going to watch the teeth and wait for now. I think that one of the teeth has become sensitive now, but I've ignored it, thinking the braces were causing it. Now I'm not sure. I've never had this condition before so I'm not familiar with the progression and symptoms.My doctor tells me that my orthodontist has been very aggressive and to fast with moving my teeth and that's why I now have the external root resorption.I've done some research online, because I was not clear about the condition from my doctor's explanation. From what I understand my only treatment options are root canal treatments on the teeth or extractions.Neither of those sound like good options to me right now. I've been traumatized by the same endodontist during my last 2 root canal treatments. One of those was just this past March and it would be very difficult for me to go through another root canal treatment even with a new doctor.I'm just wondering is it safe for me to watch and wait as my doctor has suggested or is the condition going to worsen?One tooth is sensitive and hurting now and it's hard to tell with the braces on, but it feels a little loose to me. Apparently the resorption on all 3 teeth is already severe.Any advice would be great.Thank you.JJ Zuri Barniv: Hi JJ, as you know by now, I answered this for you on my blog:\nHERE JJ_8613: Hi Dr. Barniv.Yes I saw your blog post.  Thanks for the explanation.  I'm just concerned about my teeth.  It feels like I can't do anything about this.  I guess what's done is done.

It's the upper left front tooth.I guess I'll let my dentist monitor these teeth and see what happens.JJ"

    "title": "What is wrong with my tooth",
    "dialogue": "MarkZA: HelloLast week Tuesday I had excruciating pain with my lower back right molar tooth. It felt as if the nerve was exposed and every time anything I ate brushed against it I would get this sharp pain rushing through my mouth. So I went to the dentist and he did a cavity filling. Unfortunately what has happened since in terms of pain is far worse than the initial problem that I went to the dentist for. Once the local anesthetics had worn off the real pain started. From all my searching on the internet what I have guessed is what happened was that the block injection the dentist gave me missed it mark and as a result there was muscle damage. The whole side of my face was swollen and cramped although the tooth itself was fine. I was taking pain killers every 30 minutes, along with muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatory. I could not sleep for the first 3 nights after the filling as lying down made the pain even worseOn Saturday, 4 days after the filling, this pain eventually started to ease off, its not totally gone but it is manageable and I am not on pain killers any more. Unfortunately a new problem has begun whereby every time I bite down on the tooth with the filling I get a sharp pain in my mouth, similar to the initial pain I had that I went to the dentist forSome more research has led me to believe that this is now either \nA high filling which puts pressure on this tooth when I bite. Although I am not sure this is the problem because even just pushing on the tooth with my finger hurts. Also once I have pressed once on the tooth the pain subsides and I can push on it again and there is no pain. But leave the tooth for a while and push/bite on it again and the pain is back\nI have a cracked tooth. What is strange is that this pain has only now begun 4 days after the initial filling\nI have a loose filling\nI have an abscess\nI have an appointment with the dentist again tomorrow but am really worried that he is going to hurt me again or make this worse. I don't want to go through the same pain I have just been through this last couple of daysAny advice, thoughts, experiences or information appreciatedThanks Dr.Vishwanath: Hi there. I can really understand your situation right now. The signs and symptoms what you are showing right now is of Acute or chronic apical periodontitis or severe pulpitis. What it means is that your dental caries or the tooth decay has already reached the inner layer of the tooth where the nerve of the tooth is present. So the recommended procedure will most likely involve a root canal treatment. This treatment should relieve you of your pain immediately. You will also need to be under antibiotic prophylaxis for 3-5 days depending on your dentist. Hope you recover soon.. Take Care..Bye MarkZA: Hi.So I went back to the dentist who now removed the original filling and put in a temporary filling which has sedative in it to see if the nerve would relax and told me to come back in 3 months to see if I would need a root canal. While the general pain is now much better and I am taking less pain killers I still cannot bite or chew on the tooth as it hurts very muchSo on the advice of my mother I went to see her dentist today who used a really sophisticated machine to take an x-ray of my mouth (it even played classical music while doing this). He then showed me the X-Ray on the PC and discussed it with meAccording to him what the other dentist yesterday had done was the start of an emergency root canal as he says he can see that there has been drilling into the root canal. Although the other dentist yesterday didn't mention anything about doing a root canal. Also if you do a root canal should the tooth not be sensitive anymore, I guess I will need a complete root canal for that as the tooth is still very sore when I bite on it or try to chew on it. I have been avoiding any chewing on that side of my mouth nowThe dentist I saw today said that from what he sees on the x-ray I will definitely need a route canal and waiting 3 months for the root to settle down makes no sense as the root canal has already been exposed. He recommends I wait a couple of days to see if the pain subsides and then we do a root canal in the next week or two as opposed to 3 months so that I don't develop and abscess and loose the tooth by waiting to longI am really annoyed with the original dentist as I think he made things worse and still charged me for everything he did. He didn't even take an x-ray to see what might be wrong with the toothAll I know now is I cannot chew on this tooth or but on it and I cant live with this pain. Dr.Vishwanath: Even I agree with the second dentist. Waiting for 3 months is absolutely foolish and if in the Xray it is showing that your root canals have exposed then it is better to continue with the root canal treatment and finish it without waiting. The temporary cement which has been filled in your tooth is a kind of anti inflammatory and anti microbial. It will not treat the cause. It only relieves the symptoms. I your case I feel the second dentist is right and you should follow his/her treatment plan..Regards. MarkZA: So I need to play a bit of devils advocate hereSince the first dentist has removed the original filling and put in the temporary filling which was done on Tuesday the tooth has started to feel a whole lot better. There is no pain in general and I can even chew on the tooth softly. Yes if I bite hard there is still pain I think, I havent really tried that as as much as possible I am trying to avoid using the toothNow I am wondering if the original dentist might not have been right in saying to wait 3 months and see if the tooth heals itself, lay down new layers o dentine I think it is. I know the original dentist didnt start a root canal so maybe its not necessary?"

    "dialogue": "Am4nd4: Hi all! Im 16 years old and i'm very confused as to what's happening as I ask my dentist many questions and she never directly answers them so i am beginning to not feel confident in her practice. It started on Monday I had 2 upper pre-molars pulled for my orthodontic treatment. The left side took about an hour for her to pull out and was very difficult and the right took about 10 minutes. After this she poked and prodded both holes a lot to make them bleed because I wasn't bleeding enough. I then went home and followed all the after-care instructions. I did not drink through a straw, did not rinse around my mouth, did not spit, did not touch either extraction sites with my tongue or finger. I am not on a contraceptive pill and not on my menstrual cycle. I also do not smoke. Once the local aniseptic wore off I was in a lot of pain so I did not eat for 2 days and I only drunk water. Finally on day 3 the pain was excruciating on the right side but pain killers did assist in pain relief. I went back to the dentist and she didn't even ask me where the pain was or how bad it was. Instead she just looked straight in the mouth and said \"I think it's a dry socket\" she told me that half of it was healed and the other half was a dry socket? She cleaned out the hole and filled it with some sort of medicated fabric? The pain did not instantly go away but instead lingered for a while until I took pain killers which helped a lot. I felt no pain at all until around 9 o'clock at night when I was about to go to sleep. I then a woke in terrible pain around 3:30am so I took some pain killers and tried to get back to sleep. This morning I looked at the extraction site and saw that whitish coloured stuff is growing over the medicated fabric?  Is that normal? I'm worried as the dentist told me to go back three days later (Saturday) to have the dressing replaced? Also it is normal for all this to happen? Also is the pain supposed to persist or lessen? I asked her this but she pretty much answered my questions with more questions and I'm just very confused. Also I get my braces on in 4 weeks time and I have to get more moulds & xrays of my teeth in 3 weeks, will the dry socket be healed by then? Please help? Zuri Barniv: Usually the medicated fabric is replaced every day or two to prevent the kind of pain you are having. With or without the fabric, a dry socket heals on its own in about 10 days after the extraction. Hang in there."

It is/was the only tooth I've had a filling in, since having the filling as a child I could feel slight pain in the tooth if I ate something hard on that side. Only when I ate on that side as if it was putting too much presure on filling never hurt after so just ate on other side. From part of the tooth coming out I've been able to eat on that side, had check up at dentist didn't need anything done.Now 2 days back I was eating and felt something hard in my mouth took it out and it was a bit more of the tooth that was broken. The next 2 times I cleaned my teeth part of the filling came out. I think it's all out now not 100% sure tho no more is coming out. I'm due check up at dentist which I'm dreading. Up to now I've still had no pain at all but guessing the only thing that can be done is take it out if it starts hurting as I don't think another filling would stay in. As long as it doesn't start hurting I'd rather it be left. Would dentist usually leave broken teeth if they are not causing pain?"

    "dialogue": "SnowWhite: Ok, first I'm terrified of the dentist. As a child I was sent to the dentist every year or so for cleanings; never had a cavity, never had anything wrong with my teeth from hygiene. I had a few deformed teeth as a young age however (altho parent's didn't want to get fixed) at the age of 13 my lower left tooth came in (the one before the first molar tooth) and I hadn't lost that babytooth yet, and it came between the baby tooth and the first molar tooth. It cracked them so badly neither of them where saveable. I now have a gap in that space and anytime a dentist see's me (I have medicaid) I'm very much stigmatized for not taking care of my teeth first thing that gets said is \"so, I see you have some teeth missing\", and then 4 years ago, one tried to tell me I had 4 cavities that needed to be filled (I went to 2 other dentists whom said that was false...?) It made me have a lot of anxiety about dentists... Fast forward to the age of 21, first time I've been back to the dentist since (you can guess why -- wisdom tooth bothering) She looked over everything in my mouth took exrays (both the little slot ones and the full one) and told me I needed my right lower wisdom tooth out asap... She said I had no cavities but one, and that one being a babytooth that never had an adult tooth under? She refused to answer me when I asked her if I could save the tooth.....I went to 2 other dentists to seek out opinions whom said the right lower 2nd wisdom tooth is ruined and that even a root canal most likely wouldn't be able to fix it. One claimed I had 3 cavities and that they are unable to see them on xray's but \"they are there\".Here is a copy of the xray http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=k71qd&s=8#.VbGCpvlrk3E\n^ I don't have the current Xrays, but apparently, it's coming in more and touching the nerve more..I also have hemophilia so I'm worried about the actual extraction... My questions are..1) Is there a way to fix the lower left (shows right on image) issue?\n2) Would there be a way to save my upper right (shows left on this image 4 over..?) baby tooth that doesn't have an adult tooth that will come in? I've had a few tell me no, I had one tell me yeah, they can fill it...\n3) I don't have upper wisdom teeth either is that normal?\n4) Do my xrays look terrible? I feel like they look ugly/ and dentist will judge them.\n5) I feel like my teeth are more brittle lately, I have been going through chemo and lots of steroids - could this damage my teeth?\n6) Do all cavities show up on Xrays? Are the one dentists lying to me?Some of my illnesses include hemophilia, lupus, and cancer. Due to the infections that it's causing I've been unable to do chemo to manage my illnesses and have had to go up on  predisone which has been messing with my platelets. Ugh..I need some advise ans I'm so confused with all this... Franklin Keck: It is sad I guess you must stay positive despite all these things, May be you weigh other options? Few months back I got Dental Implants in Mexico, with the help of Placidway, a medical tourism company. I was referred by this company to Sani Dental Group in Los Algodones which is a modern and highly specialized medical center. I did not have so much difficulties in undergoing the treatment since the staff were so kind to us and made my wife comfortable."

Our dentist has suggested a crown.  Is this the best way to handle this?  Should the tooth not simply be removed?  Any advice will be appreciated.  Thank you very much! Dr Allie Smith: At 9 years old, depending on where his permanent teeth are, it is usually best to try and save the baby tooth since the baby teeth are what guide the permanent teeth into the correct position. Usually pedo crowns are recommended with a pulpotomy (when the nerve of the tooth is partially removed due to decay) or if the filling covers 4 or more surfaces. Honestly, I have seen cases that at 9 years old the permanent teeth are far enough along that no treatment of the baby teeth is necessary as long as the parent is aware that the tooth may abscess in the 6months it takes to come out. I have also seen boys that don't lose their baby molars until 12 or 13 in which case you would definitely want to take care of the tooth. If the tooth behind it is a permanent molar, then definitely address that immediately."

It simply rests on it much like you would rest your elbow on a table. This is not very good. My experience has been that Maryland bridges tend to fall off more often than is worth the trouble. Ideally you would do an implant for the missing tooth and the next best option is a 3-unit bridge holding the teeth adjacent to the space (even if that means replacing the crown that is already there). Doing a Maryland bridge is asking for long-term hassles.

    "dialogue": "pilotg2: Hi, I have an ongoing problematic 2nd lower molar for over a year now.  I’ve had this since a very deep filling close to the nerve.  Quick history, deep filling done, tooth incredibly painful and sensitive afterwards, a week later replaced with temporary filling, almost complete relief, though tooth still a little sensitive.  Few months later permanent filing with a lining done.  Tooth ok, though a little sensitive. Gum often bleeds when flossing, can feel rough edge with floss.Fast forward to 3 months ago.  Tooth feels high and coming into my bite. Go to have it adjusted.  Unfortunately dentist did not know how to adjust teeth and ended up adjusting all my teeth on that side before I stopped the dentist.  Saw another dentist at the same practice immediately afterwards who made the adjustment in a couple minutes.  Tested tooth was still alive.  Trouble was now half my teeth didn’t touch on that side until I tilted my jaw a few millimetres.  I was told my teeth would move and fill the gap and not to worry. I’ve had jaw pain and neck ache since this but just when I thought and felt my teeth and jaw were coming back into line, my 2nd molar is sticking out again.This is where I would really love a dentist’s opinions on what I should do.  Been to another two dentists re this molar pushing out.  One just under 2 months ago who suggested RCT as there are very little black spots around the root of the tip.  He did say not enough to warrant a RCT so wait and see.  Went to another dentist last week, no further black spots or bone damage.  He suggested to see if the tooth is alive he drills a core into the tooth, replace the filling and put a temporary crown on with no anaesthetic.  The latter does not sound like great troubleshooting to me?  I don’t think it’s worth disturbing the top half of the tooth unnecessarily.Current state of the tooth - no pain biting down on it (never has been).  Gum at the front of the tooth bleeds heavily when flossing and floss seems to travel far down the tooth.  Started rinsing with salt and bi carb 2 days ago which seems to be firming up the gum and less bleeding.The gum hasn’t be right for a long time.  Could it be as simply as the gum infection causing the tooth to push up.  The tooth comes up high.  As it’s at the back of my mouth it touches first and I can’t touch my other teeth on that side.Goodness sorry this has got so long, I’m just at my wits end as to what to do.  I don’t want to pull the tooth."

It is a defect of tooth enamel (the outer layer of your tooth) caused by too much fluoride intake during the early age.Fluoride can be found in drinking water, toothpaste, fluoride tablets prescribed by your dentist, dental treatment and food.Fluoride is very useful for your teeth but not too much of itBe careful .. some of the children at your age swallow some toothpaste during brushing so be careful about that .. and use toothpaste which is suitable for your age and most importantly tell your dentist about it.Here is a link (video) about Fluoride and why it is useful .. I hope it is helpful https://storify.com/SusanKing1/the-superhero-of-cavity-fighting\nOther causes for white spots are trauma, loss of mineral in the teeth (hypoplasia), braces and poor care of teethI'm sure that your parents help you to write this and I'm sure that they will help you to read and understand my answer as well Best of luck .. again it is minimal in your case so I would not worry about it"

I have had a lump (not visable lump but I can feel it) in between my cheek and lower jaw line for a while which usually goes away with nurofen.   This weekend my face has swelled up on one side and even though it doesn't hurt it is very uncomfortable.  I am taking antibiotics which were prescribed yesterday by a doctor and I am seeing a dentist this afternoon.The lump/swelling is right next to a tooth which is probably going to be pulled out (it is either coming out or a root canal) and the reason it hasn't already is I saw a dentist earlier this year but they couldn't do anything as I was pregnant.I am really scared about what the dentist will say this afternoon. Hoping they can drain the abscess so that the swelling goes away but what if they don't.  Anyone else gone through this?  What was the outcome?Thank you all so much in advance drmins: Hope you had your dental consultation. It appears to be a dental abscess and can be drained off along with a dose of antibiotics. But ensure that you should either do a root canal treatment for it (if at all possible),or get it 'extracted and replaced'.thanking you\ndr.mins"

    "dialogue": "dick: He says that is what the lab charges him.  I think he is lying and just inflating to make more $.  Is he crooked or am I being paranoid.  How can dentists get away with this Zuri Barniv: Only very high-end labs would charge that much to make a dentist a crown. And that would be the total bill for the whole crown, not a surcharge on top of another fee. Many dentists charge an extra fee to make a \"white crown\" or one with no metal or some other \"upgrade\". It is commonly done when a patient has an HMO type insurance that pays the dentist a reduced fee for a basic metal crown and the dentist looks for ways to increase the fee with \"upgrades\". Not sure that is what is going on, but that's my guess."

Is it the act of brushing or is it the chemicals in the toothpaste that react to the acid that could be in the did eaten? Zuri Barniv: When you eat anything acidic (tomatoes, most fruits/citrus, etc) it etches the enamel surface which makes it vulnerable to mechanical abrasion. It is usually best to rinse after meals with plain water and wait about 15 minutes before brushing to allow the acidity to diminish. It is not necessarily bad to brush after breakfast, but you asked about possible harm from it.\nDr. Barniv"

Wednesday I ended up leaving work an going to the er because my face a lmost seemed as if I'dhad a stroke . Dr in the er said it was bells palsy an prescibed me steroids an antivral. I went to dentist who said it was a possibility bp was from my wisdom tooth being so close to the nerve she sunt me to the oral surgeon that same day. He said he didn't believe my  wisdomtooth had anything to do with the bp. He suggested a dr appt an possibly neurologist.  he also said I did need all four cut out but he wanted to wait til the bp was gone.. I followed up with a local dr who said to just take it easy an rest. I just wonder if it is my wisdom tooth an ig I went ahead an got them cut out would it go away? Or make it worse?

I don't know why I never took action earlier but I really want to change this and make my gums/teeth healthy because at the moment they are terribly rotting and my gums are almost receded. When I brush my teeth daily it seems like it does nothing to improve it. And yes, I go to the dentist every 6 months and every time I go it is always so embarrassing because my teeth are so yellow and gums are rotting... Someone please give advice on how I could actually see improvement when my gums and teeth are this screwed up. \n(Not sure if posted in right section. Sorry if it is.) Dentgr: You should ask your dentist to show you the right way in person. jonny_r: First you should heal tooth decay, gum inflammation (if you have). When you teeth become healthy, you can think about the cosmetic improvement, such as whitening, for instance. Nimita: I am assuming that you see your dentist for teeth cleaning and that's a very good thing because it involves the removal of dental plaque from teeth to help prevent tooth decay, gingivitis, and gum disease. And i think you should get teeth whitening treatment done too from your dentist and check for some articles that have amazing tips to keep one's teeth white with the help of home remedies. Pam Tiko: I had a similar problem with my gums. I had gingivitis bad, I started using a mouth rinse product called SmilePro from Dr. Rudy and in a couple of weeks I noticed a big difference in my teeth and gums. Getting your mouth healthy again takes time. It's really important to take care of yourself. So many diseases start from poor oral care and a lot of them are preventable."

    "dialogue": "Paul514: Hi,I'm a 44yr old male. I've always brushed but seem to have bad teeth. I've got several cracked and one missing tooth. My two upper front teeth were broken when I fell off my bike when I was 15 so I have crowns there now which have been in for 15years. My teeth are hardly what they call white although sometimes they look better than others which is strange but they never look particularly good. I remember when the dentist showed me the crown before he put it in, it was, well, yellowish. He said 'it matches what you've got!' and he was right.Never a particularly confident person I now feel my dental issues are affecting me. I really want to do something about it. The thing is, how do you go about it? The missing tooth is the most important, it's the fourth from the front on the upper jaw and very clearly visible when I smile and it looks awful. Now, it clearly needs a crown. However I need something done about the coloration of all my visible teeth whether that be veneers or another treatment. To me it seems there would be no point having a crown that matches my current color if I intend to do something about the others. What happens in these cases? do they just put a whiter crown on then do the rest?We moved about six months ago, i haven't looked out a new dentist yet, I hate going because I feel embarrassed even though that's probably stupid because that person is a dentist and they've probably seen much worse than I present with.In people's experience what happens when you need so much? Can you have it over a period of a few years as and when you can afford it or is it best to get a loan, get it all done as quickly as is reasonable for the work to bed down? Would love to hear other peoples experience to get some confidence that a way forward can be found. Any advice on seeking out the best dentists for long term cosmetic work would also be valuable.Appreciate your advice.P.S. I'm in Nashua, New Hampshire Bill A: My teeth also needed a lot of work. It took over 3 1/2 years for all the work to be completed. It took so long partially because of financial reasons, and also because I had the work done at a dental school, which takes longer to complete the work but offers lower fees. \nI initially also had an embarassment problem, going to the dentist, but I had a bridge break off which left me with a gap of FOUR missing front teeth, which was even more of an embarassment! \nAlso is it possible for you to get company paid dental insurance to help offset the costs? If not, you might look into purchasing an individual dental policy as it can under some circumstances help to lower your costs. Paul514: Hi Bill,Many thanks for taking the time to reply. We do have insurance through my wife's work, she's not been in the job long so the insurance has just kicked in. It does have dental but you're limited for the year and also don't think they would pay for too much cosmetic work. How much do you think you saved by going to a dental school? How did they work out a plan of action? It's funny, it feels like being vain but it's not a case of wanting 'Hollywood' teeth I just want to feel normal. People make judgements and poor teeth indicate an individual who is neglectful of their dental health when that might not be the case. \nSome of it is luck of the draw. My wife has great teeth, doesn't do anything different to me yet I'm the one who has a chip here from a pretzel and a crack there from a hard piece of toast!Do you feel you are at journeys end with the work you had? Do you feel much better for it?Many ThanksPaul 514 Bill A: Concerning the option of utilizing the services of a dental school, they usually accept new patients in the fall. They will do a screening exam and then assign you to a dental student who will then draw up a treatment plan and provide you with an estimate of the total cost. Having dental students do the work can be substantially cheaper, BUT there is a caveat to be considered. Dental students can perform work like fillings, taking impressions for and installing crowns, and preparing teeth and making the impressions for dentures. But if you need more serious work, like root canals and crown lengthenings as I did, that work needs to be done by graduate dental residents at the school at a higher price. So if you do investigate having a dental school do the work, be sure you get an estimate for any additional work (root canals & crown lengthenings) that would need to be performed by other dentists than the dental student who was assigned to prepare and execute your treatment plan.  \nThere is also the time factor to be considered is having work done by an educational institution. Each visit will probably last three hours! The dental student doesn't work on your teeth constantly for the entire time period. The student will perform a step in the treatment and then wait for a faculty member to become available to check that the work that they did was done correctly. The they will proceed to the next step. A very time consuming process.\nBut all in all I'm certainly glad that I got the work done. I talk better, I look better, and I eat more easily now that all the work has been completed than I did in the fall of 2011, before I started getting the dental work done."

Considering that I don't have any other orthodontal problems with my teeth besides the 4 teeth that are crowded, and considering my age, braces wouldn't be an ideal option for me. But I was just wondering that when the wisdom tooth comes in, and if my dentist removes it, will the crowding that I have start to space out a little bit, or will it remain exactly the same?

I asked what was ready to go and if I needed to come back for a filling and she said no, but probably next time.So next time arrives and it's gone - but instead of just a filling, I need a crown (this is another battle that I am having since doc wants to give me the crown with the silver showing and I want an all porcelain crown - she said it would be more expensive and may crack but it can be easily seen when I talk and I don't want to look 80 yet).I was very upset and I asked why we didn't do something 4 months ago. Or even make another appointment in 2 months to see how far it had gone. She said it wasn't ready.This is not a doctor that does work just for the money.

Cygre: I'm afraid I can't give any insight on what she means by \"it wasn't ready\". I don't get it either. I would think a dentist would explain what they mean when they say something vague like that.There is an in-between for your choice of crowns, though. Ask your dentist about porcelain-bonded crowns. They're not as strong as full metal crowns but they have an outward appearance of a porcelain one. They're essentially metal crowns with porcelain cover. I'd think it would cost more than a full metal one, but at least it has some strength (since your dentist seems concerned about strength of the crown)."

    "dialogue": "tlcha: Has anyone had a squeezing tooth feeling after having dental work that does not go away? Also feels like gum is swollen\neven though I don't think it is. I can feel the swollen feeling around gum in upper tooth that was worked on and teeth next to it plus the lower gum on same side where I had wisdom tooth extracted and lower tooth next to it.\nI had 2 wisdom teeth removed on upper and lower left side a year ago.\nThe lower tooth had a cyst and was right sitting on a nerve.They only took half of the tooth and cyst, I was doing well with no problems until 6 weeks later I went to my dentist to get fillings on upper and lower left side 2nd molars. The day I had the filling on upper tooth I went home in terrible pain. Turns out the upper one had to get root canal. Heres the thing. When the tooth hurt badly after the filling it not only had extreme pain it mostly had terrible pressure in it which made the lower left side jaw hurt as well. Then after the root canal the crazy part is. The pressure never left. Plus I can feel the pressure in the lower left jaw too. Its worse in the upper left 2nd molar that was filled and rt canal-ed. It has completely changed me. I am distracted by it everyday. Its very uncomfortable. I want my life back. I want to feel normal again. It feels like my gum is swollen on that side and or a ton of pressure like somebody pushing on tooth and lower jaw. Oral surgeon says he doesn't know, but kinda blames it on clenching. I wore a night guard doesn't help. I take magnesium which helps with clenching tremendously. All the dental work I had to go through without a break in a years time caused this clenching which now is very much improved. My jaw feels off and not line properly but they put that tape between teeth and say its fine. I don't know what to do or who to go to anymore. Will I be like this forever ? I thought because dentist see so many patients, that there had to be somebody they worked on with my symptoms. I really figured by now with seeing the oral surgeon, endodontist and dentist that one of them would have an answer. Does anyone else have these symptoms? or has any of you dentist out there encounter this with your patients. I am searching for answers. Bryce Barfuss: I have felt this before, however I have just ignored it until it went away. May not be the best solutions, probably isn't, but reaching out to your doctor would be my best guess. Nimita: You have to look for the guidance of a dental expert, ideally a periodontist or oral specialist, who does this sort of work, and have him or her take a X-ray, either a CT scan or Panorex. The picture ought to be of your teeth as well as your jawbone. This will allow you to preclude any sort of disease, cyst, or issue at the extraction site that could account for the repeating swelling. It's conceivable that there's an issue with the tooth nearby the extraction attachment. The tooth may have a cavity or need a root canal treatment, which would makes it feel just as its influencing the attachment socket. Teeth are near one another, and regularly neither the patient nor the dental practitioner can tell precisely which tooth is creating an issue."

After a few weeks, almost two months, I was still feeling horrible pain the wisdom tooth not removed, I went to the dentist and said I needed to get 4 root canals on different teeth, this tooth was one of them. Long story short, I went to another dentist because the previous one just wanted to collect money from me. This new dentist removed the wisdom tooth and said I only needed one root canal on number 19 ( I think) which is the upper left tooth and the other ones were going to be OK with just fillings so we did that, he did the fillings which worked pretty good. He then said to come back a few weeks later to do the root canal, I agreed, I went around to get the nerves out but after two weeks I was still feeling a lot of pain so I went back and did the \"cleaning\" part again, the second time they cleaned it they also put the temporary crown. I was still felling a lot of pain after weeks so I went back, the dentist told me my gums were really irritated and that I needed to floss and brush my teeth more often. Well here I am, almost three months later, and I still feel pain, it is so bad that I can't even drink room temperature water on the left side because it hurts A LOT, even my Left upper tooth were he did the filling hurts. I can't drink, eat, chew or do anything on that side and it's really bothering me. I don't know what to do. Any suggestions? Nimita: At the point when a tooth pains after root trench, Several elements may be included . In the event that temperature affectability or agony exists, its either another tooth alongside the tooth being referred to, or a frill or primary nerve still leaves in the tooth and the root trench should be withdrawn. On the off chance that temperature does not bring about any throbbing torment then a crack in the tooth, and an in sick fitting crown could cause it."

However one thing has stood out like a sore thumb and that is the highly variable and generally poor quality of partial dentures, both acrylic and chrome and both NHS and private..  For reasons that are beyond me dental technicians seem to find it difficult to design and produce clasps which are sturdy and capable of lasting for any length of time. In my case, with lower front partials, the clasps usually break in less than 3 months particularly the puny looking pieces of stainless wire which is used for many clasps and the chrome partials have not lasted much longer. Is this normal? Dentgr: A lucky guess is that the teeth that have the clasps on are not parallel so they (clasps) are too stressed during insertion and removal. AnnMarie: I was encouraged to have a partial upper against my better judgment as I wanted my last 7 remaining teeth pulled. My teeth are low enamel and fracture, spent to many years battling tooth problems and wanted a full denture once and for all. My temporary partial broke tonight after 2 months right across were the clasps attach from the eye teeth. They can't get me in to repair it for six days. My swelling went down and it put stress on the front bite. I'm toothless for a while I guess and a busy day awaits me tomorrow. I feel your pain. I'm 54 and am hoping by the time I'm 80 I'll be done with the tooth dilemma. Nimita: I guess that is the reason why they ask to go for dental implants rather than going for dentures.

    "dialogue": "planetary: Three years ago I had a wisdom tooth removed and had such a severe allergic reaction that my entire body was covered in circular red marks, my face was so swollen it looked like I'd been hit by Mike Tyson, and I had a full body itch so bad I couldn't sleep for a week. I was hospitalized three times that week, and the last time I thought I was going to die. They eventually put me on hardcore \"steroid\" type drugs to get the allergic reaction under control, and it took weeks to taper off the drugs. I dont have words for how miserable the whole experience was, and it took a LONG time for my body to recover fully.During treatment my doctors contacted the dentist and asked him which anesthetic he used, but they didn't get an answer. When I was finally well enough to call the dentist myself a few weeks later, the only response that I got was a voicemail from him saying the reaction could not have been triggered by the anesthetic but was probably completely unrelated to the dental work, or it was a reaction to the preservative in the anesthetic.I never got a straight answer, and I haven't been to a dentist since because frankly I'm terrified. Now I've been dealing with a hollow, broken tooth that constantly throbs, and I'm worried there's an exposed nerve because the pain is absolutely brutal. I called to confirm a walk-in emergency dental office is open today, but I can't go through with it because, as horrendous as this tooth pain is, that allergic reaction was worse than anything I've ever experienced.I'm livid that I never got a straight answer from my previous dentist regarding the anesthetic he used.

Could it be when the oral surgeon pulled out my wisdom tooth got a piece of filling stick under my gum and sowed up my gum and that is how it healed?

I would like a second opinion? Zuri Barniv: Without a 3D cone beam x-ray of your jaw, it would be very hard for your dentist to say something like that and it's impossible for anyone here to give you advice without it as well. Nimita: Impacted wisdom teeth are wisdom teeth which do not fully erupt into the mouth because of blockage from other teeth. If the wisdom teeth do not have an open connection to the mouth, pain can develop with the onset of inflammation or infection or damage to the adjacent teeth."

    "dialogue": "bethybug138: OMG! PLEASE tell me I am not the only one!  I went to the dentist yesterday to start putting on a crown. They have to \"prep\" the 1st day and finish the 2nd visit. In order to prep you have to have your tooth drilled on....through the enamel I guess. Anyway, after 5 injections... and a little drilling... he was unable to keep me numb enough to finish. He said he had reached the max amount of injections and that more would damage my liver. So they put a coating on my tooth and made an appt for 2 weeks from now. I am not able to have epinephrine in the injections even though I know it lasts longer. He said he would research to see if he could use Marcaine (I think) if it came without epinephrine. Also they told me that some days you could get numb easier than other days..... WHAT???? Injections DO wear off on me fast but I went in there thinking I could get through this and now I am anxious as heck!  They told me it would not hurt his feelings if I went somewhere else where they either sedate or do something besides injections. I have made an appt with a dentist I don't know now... but because they will take my insurance and will give me gas. Sorry...this is my first post and I tried searching but did not find this exact problem. I would love to see info from experts and non-experts that have maybe been through this. I asked if they got any other people like me and they said not usually...  they were nice but I could tell they did not know what to do with me. I am very compliant... not a nervous person...but THIS is freaking me OUT! Zuri Barniv: Many people think they are \"allergic\" to the epinephrine in anesthetics because it makes their heart race. If you were allergic to epinephrine, you would long be dead because your body secretes it all day long. Giving anesthetics without epinephrine can cause many numbing problems like yours. Injecting anesthetics very slowly can usually alleviate the problem you might have. There are also other methods of administering anesthetics you will need to look up like \"intraosseous\" and \"periodontal ligament\" injections. These usually do the trick for patients that can't get numb. Incidentally, it takes a lot more than 5 shots to damage your liver.\nDr. Barniv bethybug138: Zuri Barniv said:\t\t\tMany people think they are \"allergic\" to the epinephrine in anesthetics because it makes their heart race.

I went to another dentist who gave me gas and injections but still was unable to numb me enough in one area. She is making a crown with a band because of that.

Two years down the line and the tooth still hasn't appeared so I think he is going to have a chain attached and the tooth pulled down.  It has moved a little but not much.  However, at his most recent consultation, the dentist commented that he has the teeth of an 8 year old - lots of remaining baby teeth still in the back of his mouth (I'm not sure how many but a surprising amount, judging by the dentist's reaction).  He was x-rayed and the second teeth are all there - they just don't seem to be pushing the baby teeth out.  My question is - should I be worried?  The front tooth is being dealt with, if all goes according to plan, it will be pulled into place.  But what about the back teeth?  Is it still within the \"normal\" range for second teeth to be coming through this slowly?  He is a high achiever at school but quite small for his age - is growth related to tooth development?

    "title": "Problem with extraction, please help, any advice?",
    "dialogue": "OxyMade: I'm 16, and as a very young child I got abused by my dentist and.. long story short I'm very hesitant with dental work. I The issue happened at around 6 or 7.. and I refused to go to a dentist.. April 2014 I finally got tired of all the tooth pain and decided to go and get everything fixed. I got a fantastic dentist and I have no problems letting him do anything. he's done a lot of deep fillings and a root canal. I don't care about it.. it doesn't make me nervous, I have no problem with getting injected with lidocaine because I'm so used to it. However when I first went in April 2014 my dentist and I made a sheet of everything that needed to be fixed and both of my second molars needed to be extracted. #18 is worse than the other one.\nIn fall 2015 I went to an oral surgeon to get them both extracted and the lidocaine alone wasn't enough for me when he attempted to pull them it felt like no lidocaine was there. I was told I could be knocked out.(I'm now realizing that it doesn't mean totally knocked out.. apparently it only makes you groggy and you don't remember anything) so I go back to the same oral surgeon and he puts the IV in me and that's all I remember until waking up and being sat up and he was done. I didn't know much that was going on when I \"awoke\", but the first thing I did was feel only #31(left side second molar) was out and I said why did you only take one out and he told me that he had to stop because I started flipping out and grabbed his arm while he was doing it and kicked one of the assistants and put her on workmen's comp. I was very confused because I didn't remember any of this. After recovery of the extraction I attempted to setup another appointment to extract #18 and he told me because of what happened he couldn't put me out because he could get sued so I tried again with just lidocaine and I couldn't do it. The oral surgeon then verbally abused me because I was having a hard time with the tooth and he was rushing on the last time he attempted to extract it and he was getting frustrated so I tried a new oral surgeon to see if they could put an IV in me, but that oral surgeon told the next one the situation so it didn't matter what oral surgeon I went to they could only use local. This next oral surgeon was very nice and so very patient with me I was so surprised, yet again I couldn't do it.. he said he couldn't inject anymore lidocaine into me yet as soon as he pulled on the tooth just the slightest it was just the absolute worst pain it felt like there was no lidocaine injected at all. A week after he tried last time I was in constant pain, they prescribed me tylenol 3.. after another week I stopped taking it and it was a horrible pain so I was always taking it and always having them prescribe it to me whenever it ran out. This was in December or January 2014/2015. A few weeks ago in April 2015 I just had a few more fillings done and while there my dentist asked me if he could take out the decay out of #18 to make it not hurt all the time and possibly easier to extract and I was very numb and not feeling any of the fillings.. usually I would say no in fear that I would feel pain, but I said go ahead. As he went I felt nothing. He also, took a lot of the tooth down because the sharp edges were cutting my tongue and cheek and when I left it didn't touch my cheek or my tongue so I was happy. A couple days after this appointment I realized what he did by taking all the decay out was make the tooth completely hollow exposing the nerve. Since then food gets in there every single time I eat something food gets stuck and I use a small pick with bristles as the end to get it out, I always stab my nerve. It's always a very bad constant ache. The tylenol 3 I mentioned earlier wasn't doing enough so they prescribed me vicodin and whenever I don't take it it just hurts constantly.. on friday I ran low and my dentist was on vacation so I had to wait until today Monday to get more and then he told me that he's prescribed me so much that he can't prescribe anymore.. now I have to just sit through constant pain and am trying to get the tooth extracted but, what should I do? I can't be given IV and it's so much pain getting it pulled with just lidocaine, never mind how hesitant i am to even try with just lidocaine because I already know it's going to hurt?\nAny advice will be appreciated."

    "title": "Seeking advice regarding boyfriend’s dental hygiene",
    "dialogue": "Serena: I would appreciate some feedback on how to deal with an issue I am having with my boyfriend regarding his dental hygiene. Sorry in advance for the lengthy post, but I think a little background is necessary. Basically, he does not take good care of his teeth. He only brushes once or twice a week, never flosses, the only thing he does consistently is scrape his teeth with a toothpick after every meal. His teeth are in decent shape but a little on the yellow side. His reasoning behind it is that many of the common dental practices are actually bad for teeth – for example he thinks brushing wears away the enamel, and he won’t whiten his teeth because he says teeth aren’t naturally supposed to be white and artificial whiteners damage teeth. Plus, he says, back in the day before modern dentistry, people got by fine without all the “gimmicks” we adhere to today. He is also very hesitant to see a dentist because apparently when he was younger, he didn’t go to the dentist until he was about 10 years old (his family was poor and did not have consistent health insurance for the first few years of his life), and he said that when he went to the dentist for the first time, the dentist told him that his teeth were in great shape, no cavities etc. The dentist did recommend brushing more frequently, which he started to do. 6 months later, when he went in for another cleaning, he suddenly had 5 cavities. He says this has been a trend throughout his life – the more he brushes and goes in for cleanings, the more cavities he has. He thinks he will be fine because he maintains a fairly healthy diet and does not eat a lot of sugary or acidic food, which he says is more important in determining dental health.I’ve discussed this with him and he is pretty stubborn about it. He agreed to go to the dentist in the near future and even finally bought dental insurance through his job the other day, but said he will only go for a consultation and if the dentist says his teeth look fine, he will not let them clean his teeth, and he will continue his current practices (though he agreed that he should probably start flossing). In my opinion, he is being immature by relying on his own anecdotal theory as opposed to the advice that is overwhelmingly accepted by the vast majority of experts/people. The only thing I kind of understand is his reluctance to whiten his teeth – as much as the superficial part of me would like him to have whiter teeth, I have stopped pressing that issue because I’d rather focus on actual dental health as opposed to vanity. But with respect to the brushing/cleaning issue, it’s hard for me to intelligently argue with him because I’m no expert, everything I “know” about teeth was told to me by dentists, toothpaste companies, etc., which my boyfriend claims is  biased information because dentists and toothpaste companies have an inherent interest in promoting these things for their own benefit. I’ve shown him websites saying what can happen if you don’t brush, but he’s not convinced, he blames it on the fact that people eat too much sugar nowadays.I’m wondering if anyone who is more knowledgeable than myself can provide feedback on his claims. Is his reasoning at all credible? For example, is there any evidence that in times before modern dentistry, people’s teeth were still generally healthy? Are white teeth actually less healthy than yellowish teeth? Does regular brushing actually wear down enamel? Can you suggest anything I can say or show to him, preferably something that is grounded in actual evidence as opposed to general statements made by some dentistry association website? Particularly, if anyone has a link to a study or research paper on this topic, that would be helpful. Thanks in advance! drmins: Serena said:\t\t\tIn my opinion, he is being immature by relying on his own anecdotal theory as opposed to the advice that is overwhelmingly accepted by the vast majority of experts/people.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nYeah. You have found out the real answer.Keep smiling...a whiter smile.Good luck.\nDr.mins Chris_Fisher: Brushing your teeth regularly does not create cavities.

I hadn't been for my check up in 3 years which I know was wrong but I ended up having to go to the emergency dentist. He said I had a cavity on my back left molar, no xray was done. He said he was putting in a temporary filling which was huge and lumpy I couldn't  chew properly for days even on the other side of my mouth but he said to see my regular dentist. Relieved I went to see my normal dentist a week later he said it wasn't a temporary filling but a permanent one and that it had ground down enough now to not cause problems all the rest of my teeth were perfect. 2 weeks later the most excruciating pain I have ever felt on the same tooth was back yet again and I had to see an emergency dentist again, this time I had an xray and I had a severe tooth infection I was given antibiotics which haven't touched the pain even with pain killers this dentist said I need a root canal or to have it extracted. ( I'm having an extraction I can't stand the pain any longer and I now have a fear of dentists as I am nearly 100% sure the original dentist filled in infection.) So what should I do about it should I complain or what? I don't know what to do I'm going on holiday in a few days and I need to have the tooth out but if I can't get my dentist to do it in time I'm scared to go back to the emergency dentist I'm considering trying to pull it out myself rather than let that butcher near my teeth again. drmins: Dear friend, it would be good if you can upload that x-ray image.From the history given above,it appears  that you had a deep caries that was causing the pain initially. If you had taken an x-ray at that time,it would have been evident and you would have been given a caries excavation and pulp capping OR a root canal treatment.Instead,you went for a filling and now, the underlying caries would have spread still further and reached the pulp,that caused this intense pain.It is not that the dentist filled the infection in to your tooth.

So I left it.  By Wednesday it was very wobbly and I was concerned it would not last the holiday period, but was again told it would still be useless to see the dentist, if I still had the crown in the tooth.   I tried to argue with her but got nowhere.  Today the crown came out when I was eating bread & jam for breakfast and I swallowed it!

Not to mention the uncomfortable mouth and the horrible look of the gap in my front teeth.  Also, this crown has always felt too big for the space and I have always been aware of it, which the dentist ignored, although the first crown had to go back as he couldn't fit it as it was too big.

The last week or so, I've been getting a dull ache occasionally around the same area. It seems to be getting worse. I was able to get Penicillin and have taken it the last 6 days. Doesn't seem to be clearing anything up. It doesn't feel like it has anything to do with any of my other back teeth. I don't have any sensitivity to cold/heat or sweets. I'll admit, I really, really don't like going to dentists! I had an amazing one the last 5 or so years but he has now retired. Any ideas? drmins: The pain you complain of, needs better examination to conclude. There are chances of it being a radiating pain,due to another or adjacent carious tooth.Do not take antibiotics without proper diagnosis. CDoG: I appreciate the reply. I realize it isn't wise taking the antibiotics, but I just hate going to the dentist that much. The two adjacent teeth have both had fillings done within the last 4 years. I don't have any other symptoms; senitivy, etc. CDoG: Could it be something like a bone fragment from the wisdom tooth extraction? drmins: Pls get a radiograph taken,for those two filled teeth.Chances are that,there may be a secondary caries developed beneath any of those fillings. Also,check for any caries in the upper tooth on the same side.Less likely to be due to any bone fragment resulted from previous extraction,as it was almost 4 year ago.\nGet a radiographic image. CDoG: Ok thank you. Will look into having it looked at. The extraction was about a year and half ago... the two adjacent fillings were 4 years ago. drmins: Same comments.

Also, i have severe painful spasms (thrombing) during the day sporatically, and at night when trying to sleep. AS i am writing this , when i close my mouth and i gingerly bite , iam in pain!I have used ice , heat on my right jaw. I am  very sensitive,delicate  why this is happening,?the sensor and aiming ring was dexis,standard size, nothing uncomfortable but the weight! do you think a nerve(s) has been touched upon?I hope no damage to teeth(crack, fillings) x- ray showed no damage.WHY Am I hurting? IS this unusual?Took an otc pain med as suggested by dental office,not much they can do.      many-thanks. drmins: Firstly, why was the x-ray image taken?\nSecondly, a sensor will not cause any damage to your teeth or nerves. But it can possibly cause a little trauma to the soft tissue of your mouth,if not properly placed.This might have led to the formation of an ulcer or sore that causes the pain.This will heal in a week or few days.You can try saline gargle several times a day (provided you are not hypertensive) or try gargle with an ayurvedic prescription as follows:\nTry thinning down yogurt by adding water and salt proportionately. You can hold this in mouth for some time and then ingest it.( Adding a little cut green chilly and coriander leaves make it a soothing cold drink in the summer )Thanking you\ndr.mins"

I'd hate to spend a ridiculous amount of money on dental work only to lose my teeth to periodontal disease later on. So that really weighs in on my desire to get permanent dentures as well. drmins: You are really mistaken about the differences of having a removable complete denture and having your natural teeth preserved.\nRemovable dentures can never give the exact comfort of your natural of fixed tooth.And also,can to a bit,decrease your confidence.Bone resorption and limitations in oral hygiene maintenance are other factors to be considered when planning a multiple extraction and removable partial denture.And as you worry, though hereditary factor can contribute to periodontitis, proper oral hygiene and preventive measures can help you prevent it aggreviating.So i strongly recommend you to reconsider your decision of \"removing your teeth in anticipation of a possible periodontitis in future' and have a conservative approach instead.Thanking you\ndr.mins"

About 18 months ago i thought I had an abscess, 4 of my teeth became very painful and they felt like there was a pressure under them.  I went to the dentist who then performed an x-ray.  The x-ray revealed a dark patch under some of my teeth so naturally my dentist thought I needed root canal.  The trouble is though all my teeth are vital except one that had had root canal treatment 10 years ago.The tooth that has had root canal is on the end of the 4 problematic teeth.  I got a second opinion because I didn't think teeth needed root canal if they where vital.  The verdict I got then was that the tooth that had previously had root canal needed re-doing.  I couldn't afford the fees for getting it done privately so I went back to my NHS dentist who was confident she could perform the treatment.A couple of weeks ago she re-worked the tooth with root canal and from what I can see from the x-ray she's done a really good job.  A fresh x-ray showed that the filling stuff had spread into the lateral canals and she was pleased with how it went.About 5 days later the other 3 teeth starting throbing again and my gum swelled up and became very painful for around 24 hours.  I think the gum may have burst and the swelling went down but I still feel a discomfort under the teeth.  I went back to the dentist and she ruled out the problem being an abscess and is herself seeking advice as to what the problem could be.The situation now is I have 3 vital teeth that look to need root canal because the x-ray is showing dark patches at and around the root of 2 of my teeth.

Or if it is just a discoloration, and my teeth are simply still sensitive from the drilling/filling.I'll attach a picture: Front and center are my lovely new fillings, but then there is a very small, dark pinpoint on my tooth which is what I'm curious about.Thanks in advance for any feedback!"

    "dialogue": "Drane: I had a tooth in which an older filling had gotten a hole, and there was some decay underneath on side with the hole in the filling. So the dentist told me that I could either do a root canal or a crown. I'm assuming that the reason he didn't want to replace the filling is because underneath it was too deep.     Anyhow, I declined lidocaine, and proceeded to cut the tooth to fit a crown. I felt him cut into the tooth adjacent from the tooth he was fitting with a crown. And now ever since, it feels as though the tooth behind the crowned tooth is extremely sensitive to any cool water that I rinse that passes between the teeth. The dental office had recommended that I use a waterpik rather than flossing with a string, so I bought one, and when I use it to force water between the crowned tooth and the tooth behind it, it's extremely sensitive to a point that anymore than a second or two, and it gets excruciating. Now, warm water doesn't make it sensitive. It's just cool and cold water that it's sensitive too.     Is this normal, or did the dentist screw up? What would be the way to fix this problem with the sensitivity.      I talked to the dental office, and they told me that I could do another crown on the back tooth, but I don't really want to destroy that tooth to fit a crown. I don't mind taking out the old crown and fitting a new one after the tooth behind it is fixed.\nThey said that I should come in and talk to the dentist that did my tooth, but the dentist that did my tooth was gone, so I'm supposed to come in and visit them this week to talk about this tooth behind the crowned tooth. Dentgr: Root canal OR a crown? First time to hear. A tooth either needs a root a canal or not.\nAre you sure the pain is due to the tooth next to the crown?\nDon't do another crown....

JFranco: Hi KevinI am no expert here but I really want to go down the implant route (pun unintended) from what I can gather it's just like a normal tooth except it's stronger and healthier. They place a screw type thing into your gums where your old teeth was and then a tooth is attached to the top of that and looks perfectly normal. i'd imagine having it removed it just like having your tooth removed. tooth implant is a process that costs hundreds, they make an artificial tooth (3d printed, I believe) of your old tooth and place it on top. if it's on the front I believe it can be free because it can interfere with your life.\nI had my back tooth taken and I wanted it back so enquired about implants but will have to pay too much as it's seen as a cosmetic issue although I know lack of tooth can cause issues with the jawbonehope this helps!"

I had crooked teeth and a crossbite that was fixed by braces and the rubber bands during the treatment, but, over time, my lower jaw started coming forward and now have an underbite. Along with my underbite, my teeth are offset by almost 3/4 of a tooth (measured assuming my upper teeth are in proper allignment, which appears so.) My lower left-side bicuspid is also leaning into my mouth at about 30 degrees (by eyeing).\n  If I forcefully try to force my jaw back, I am able to get one of my teeth get one set of my incisors to touch with no other teeth having contact. I feel as if it impairs my speech because I occassionally slur my words and have to take a breather to restate my sentences because they were incomprehensive. My tongue, at rest, sort of \"tucks\" under the upper teeth since I have an underbite. Besides that, my teeth serve as a giant personal insecurity as I cannot expose my upper teeth in a smile.All-in-all, I've tried to grasp what my possibilities are. I came up with two different possibilities in which I will back up with my personal reasoning as I'm not a professional. Do keep in mind that I am a college student (for age reference). Any/all of the following would be done by a professional.\n1. Develop a gap in my teeth where the two permanent teeth were removed and have an implant placed to make my upper jaw bigger.\n2. Remove both lower second bicusids (as one of them are leaning in) and make my lower jaw smaller. However, I feel like this wouldn't exactly fix my speech.\n3. Somehow fixing everything with just another set of braces.I AM working a part-time along with being a full-time student in hopes that I'll save enough to afford a treatment of some sort. I've accepted that this is how I look and  anything I do will cost a lot of money, but I'd like to know my options. DRAVG: Get an orthodontic assessment.

I'm not sure how reasonable some of his expectations are, but I thought it would be worth reaching out to the experts. I'm lucky I even got him to agree to get work done! Now I just need to find the right avenue to take.He had braces when he was 16-18. He's now about 32. They didn't clean his teeth properly after they took the brackets off. He suspects that the glue may have been corrosive because it stripped his teeth of all of its enamel. Later on he started getting cavities in multiple teeth – starting about 6 years ago. The first one started in the top right side of his front teeth, and then the next one to be affected was the same tooth on the top left side. Recently they've spread to two more on the left side. The majority of the cavities appeared to be focused on his top front teeth as far as we can see, which makes it embarassing for him. I've convinced him to start considering dental work, but he's really stubborn so any information you can offer in regards to treatment options would be incredibly helpful.\nHe's read about the negative side effects of fluoride, and does't like this as a treatment method. If it's the absolute only option he would still do it, seeing as his cavities are bad now. But he would prefer an alternative treatment if there is one. Any evidence you may be able to provide regarding the effectiveness of fluoride in treating cavities, and pros and cons regarding its use would also be helpful, as well. He REALLY doesn't want to get his teeth pulled. But he absolutely will not have crowns either. He would rather have his teeth pulled and replaced then topped with artificial crowns.\nDoes anyone possibly have any idea what type of dental doctor he would need to see, and what possible options there might be for treating this?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.Thank you for taking the time to read this.\nSincerely,--NN"

My pressre in the upper root canal tooth and lower 2nd molar and or lower jaw area where the wisdom tooth was recently extratced have pressure or tooth squeezing feeling and burning in gums back there as well only on left side where the wisdom teeth were extrated, fillings , root canal were done. All this trama happened over the past 8 months. I started having all the dental work 6 weeks after the wisdom tooth extraction. I was completely healing and feeling god til I went and started with the fillings and then the upper 2nd molar filling turned into rot canal. I still have this pressure in the area I mentioned to you. It first started after dentist put dental dam on tooth and filled the upper 2nd molar which then turned into root canal. I have it everyday all day long. Open or cloed mouth. Feels best when I chew on food. Takes some of the pressure away. Or if I push on my back jaw area it also helps take pressure away. I don't know what to do for it or what specialist to see. My oral surgeon doesnt know. My denitst doesnt know. I have never gone though this and I go to dentist every 6 months. drmins: Let me not get confused. This is what i understand as your complaint.\n1) You have got a root canal treated upper molar on the left side and its paining now.\n2) You also feel that there is pain on the gums in the lower tooth region,on the same side,i.e left.Am i correct? Okay. If it is so,kindly get a radiograph (x-ray) image of your root canal treated tooth and upload the same here."

    "dialogue": "gardener: I have been going to the same dentist for close to 15 years now. The dentist has for the most part been friendly, and professional, but recent procedure resulted in unnecessary damage to a tooth. I am wondering whether the dentist's peculiar attitude, which I am certain led to the damage, should have been an indicator to me to have found another dentist before this incident happened.Whenever I had come in for checkup or procedure and had the dentist look at something new, the dentist was pleasant and willing to take a look at it. However, if I ever had questions post-procedure or during, the dentist would get defensive immediately, the answer to anything was always something I would have done to cause 'it'. -- Also, the dentist would routinely ask a question related to 'did I notice' anything about my teeth that could have been related to the condition of my visit, and on three occasions regardless of what I answered, the dentist would say \"Oh! You 'grind your teeth.' I better note that in your chart.\" The first time it happened I was able to correct the dentist immediately because we were between tasks (rinsing). The dentist got really defensive and insisted I said that I \"grind my teeth.\" Second time, the dentist commented that they were going to note it in the chart, but since they had just put gloves on and had the utensils already in hand, waited until the next task of the procedure, I had to wait until the procedure was over to tell the dentist to strike their note in my chart; that took 3 to 5 minutes to get past their defensiveness and get them to erase it. This time the dentist did it again, but waited until the middle of the procedure to say they were going to note it in the chart. My mouth was full, and thought I would deal with it afterwards. I was having a cap reattached and in the past the dentist would use the drill with some sort of attachment to beat the cap to make minor adjustments, except this time they used some other drill bit and shaved off part of my opposing (good) tooth, because in their mind it was my 'grinding teeth' that caused the cap to come off. As soon as I felt the drill I raised my hand for them to stop, but they ignored me. Their response (which was a defense), 'I didn't go as far as the enamel'... Yeah like that makes it all better.Is the \"Oh! You grind your teeth.\" and defensive attitude a personal thing?\nor some sort of positioning if they are sued?\nNow that I am going to find a new dentist, should I be watching out for similar attitude?I would assume yes I should be watching out, but there were two other occasions with this dentist where they just did their craft regardless of my wishes, though minor, both were important to me, which makes me think that it was just them not putting the customer (me) first."

    "dialogue": "TinGrin: For 25 years of regular dentist visits both at home and military my teeth have been great. Zero cavities (hooray!).Then, boom, I go to a new dentist in my new town and I have 6 cavities. They're deep cavities, caught very early with an infrared camera that can see deep into crevaces in my teeth apparently. Sounded legit, and the dentist was in a big city with a long list of patients and a perfect score on Google.com. So, I asked a few questions...why all these cavities so suddenly? What did I do wrong? etc. She assured me that my dental hygiene was fine and that cavities eventually develop in hard to reach places in your teeth.SO... she fixed them. Topical numbing agent on my gums, shots of lidocaine to the gums, and she went to town. She also sanded off some old dental cement that was on my lower right canine.Fastforward to the next day. I cannot drink water of ANY temperature. I cannot eat anything cold. Not old does the temperature of the food send me into a 10 second still-frame of pain and sensitivity but the biting down on soft noodles hurts the teeth operated on (\"restored\"). Also, the canine that had the cement on it? Turning black from the inside... a dull darkness (but very distinct). I tell my dentist and I go back in, more Xrays. She says the dark tooth looks fine but may need a root canal in the future. She attributes the sensitivity to my use of whitening toothpaste and my tooth grinding. Which, I know are very likely causes... but it's now been 2.5 months since the \"restoration\" and I still can't eat bananas, pudding, cold sandwhiches, drink any liquids, or basically breathe a breath of cold air without extreme pain!!  2.5 months of wearing a mouth guard and using non-whitening paste.Why?? I want to know without a doubt that nothing the dentist did has caused all this mayhem in my usually perfect mouth. Could any of the drugs or the operation itself caused all this? I mean, it all started the next day... I am having trouble believing that coinicidentally my bruxism and whitening toothpaste use decided to have this maddening affect the day after she worked on 6 of my teeth. Please advise!"

    "dialogue": "erinb: Hello,I've had a dental bridge on my lower left side (one adult molar never grew in and then one of abutment teeth cracked) for just over 7 years now. Lately (really for the last year) on and off, I've been having pain that feels like it's coming from under the bridge.I went to the dentist last week, and they said the bridge looks fine and isn't loose (he even grabbed it with a tool to see if it would come off). The x-rays didn't reveal any issues, but they couldn't see all of the teeth due to the metal inside the bridge. I  really just feel like the pain is coming from the bridge. Is it worth it to ask for the bridge to be removed to see if the abutment teeth are healthy or have decayed under there? Or does anyone have any other suggestions? It's not a constant pain, but it is nearly every day now. I've also had jaw, ear, eye, neck, and chest pain on the left side as well, which has led me to wonder about TMJ also. My doctor suggested maybe I had TMJ dysfunction. The dentist said there was no evidence of grinding or clenching, and he wasn't sure about TMJ, but said it was possible. Is it worth going to a TMJ specialist?Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! DRAVG: how old are you? when last did you visit your physician? erinb: 33, and early in the summer. I've had lots of tests run for other things because of this constant pain, but everything has come back normal. My last visit is when she suggested TMJ. erinb: Anyone?Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

Over the last few months I have noticed that my front teeth have become slightly see through which looks like a discoloration and makes me look like I have rotten teeth!  I am in date with my regular dental checkups and last time i saw my dentist he said my teeth were in good condition.  I don't eat sugar, I don't smoke or drink that much alcohol and I am generally healthy.  I use sensodyne toothpaste and a fluoride building mouthwash.  I am stuck and could really do with some advice and another opinion before I get forced to throw an entire months wages down the drain seeing a dentist.  Thank you! Shayla: I have seen people having such kinda teeth, do you drink excessive cold water/drinks etc.? helelle: hmm, I drink a lot of cool water but it is always tap water, never from the fridge or a cooler. I drink a lot of herbal tea though and I tend to have an 'asbestos' mouth (as my mother calls it) so I guess I might drink them hotter than some people do. Shayla: The reason behind this could also be acid erosion. If acidic drinks/juice is consumed in an excessive amount then eventually our natural enamel gets damaged and causes a faded/transparent look on our teeth. Try to avoid that and as far as herbal tea, I don't think that's harmful at all. helelle: That I can understand but I don't drink fizzy drinks or fruit juice because of the sugar.  Any other ideas?  Although saying that, I will do research into other acidic foods and try and reduce as I am very much interested in a wholesome, sugar free, healthy and nutritious diet."

I then queried this in very polite terms only to get a letter through the post dismissing me from his care.I suspect he is just trying to irrationally cover his back and it is more convenient for him to remove me from his patients list.What do I do now?

    "dialogue": "Amanda32: I joined this forum cos I can express my fears with anyone seeing my teeth. I've probably only got half the teeth I should,some have broke,2 were kicked out (horse) and 2 exploded after root canal. I never developed my fear until I was mid 20's. I had root canal done but the following day i could feel pressure building up, and it was like a mini explosion and I lost 2 teeth? That dentist was closed down a few months later? About a year later a tooth broke and exposed the nerve causing horrific pain,I put up with the pain rather than face my fear. My friend found a dentist that dealt with nervous patients,on route to the dentist I was sick,then passed out in the waiting room. When I finally saw the dentist I got a 20 minute slating of the state of my teeth then told i needed 6 teeth extracting. As you can imagine I went into full panic mode and felt so ashamed, embarassed and belittled. I've never seen a dentist since,now its through fear and finances. I have badly receeding gums and 2 of the bottom teeth are loose,I brush twice a day with a gum protection toothpaste and use listerine gum treatment mouthwash, but it's getting me so depressed, My face looks 'drawn in' due to tooth loss but I have completely lost my confidence,I don't really smile and I avoid looking at people. Its now starting to affect my marriage. Is there any training schools where I could be a 'guinea pig' for students doing cosmetic surgery at a greatly reduced rate? seashell: Dear Amanda,\nI'm not a dentist,but I had a really really bad fear from dentists.I would for example get sick whenever I should've gone to dentist and would put up with horrible pain just so I wouldn't have to go to the dental office.I also felt embarassed and felt like the dentist was judging me.But trust me,you just have to forget about all of that,brushing teeth is no longer going to help you.You need to tell yourself 100 times you can do it,if you get sick like that you can find someone to go with you for the first time.Go around random dentists,find the one you like! Also,you have to realise dentist are not going to judge you cause of your teeth,they just want to help you,whenever you feel ashamed of your teeth remember that they have probably seen worse! And there is help,don't lose hope,you just gotta realise the more you postpond the visit to the dentist it's going to get worse. I had a little different situation than yours cause I haven't been to dentist for 7 years,then at the age of 19 realised what mess I have done.Now I am going to dentist every week,and the feeling is amazing! Whenever you do something,you will feel so great because you are finally doing something with it.It's probably going to take some time,you are going to loose some teeth,but there is still small decays which you can prevent from becoming bigger and that way save some of your teeth. I think there are dental offices at colleges where students do surgeries for better prices,at least that's how it goes in my country.Sitting home and worrying isn't going to change anything. I hope I helped you at least a little bit,and I really hope you are going to fix your teeth,and there is always help trust me!"

I am a 37 year old female who has an EXTREME fear of dentists due to a horrible dental experience when i was under 10 where i was afraid of the drill and the male dental assistant held me down.  i was terrified.  Needless to say, I never went back and saw a different dentist 10 years later only rather than discuss options, drilled cavities in the front of my teeth and naturally fast forward to current, those fillings fell out and due to lack of insurance and finances, never could get them taken care of.  in my teens, i had braces for a short run as the glue and my teeth did not gel together and the glue literally ate  my enamel.  Anyways, at this current time, i know i need dentures.  there is no saving or fixing.  i have about 9 of my natural teeth left due to my own stupidity and not taking care of my teeth due to the EXTREME fear of dentists i have had.  i am actually screaming for dentures at this point so i can smile.  anyways, i woke up with this lump on the inside of my cheek like where the top and bottom teeth meet.  if i feel it with my tongue, which i cant seem to stop, it feels smooth.  if i feel it with my finger on the inside and my thumb on the outside of my cheek, it feels like a little knot, like a little twig could be in there.

I just assumed you either had bad or good teeth and well to cut a long story short I finally got the courage to go to the dentist and as I suspected I need quite a bit of workSo far I had three teeth pulled and one root canal. The dentist said that I need to wait a couple of months to get dental implants.Now I possibly need two more extractions and a filling/crown. The reason why I say possible is because the dentist said she could save the one, but the two in the back needs to come out (which surprised me since they not nearly as bad as the one she said she could save). I don't really have the luxury of getting multiple opinions as I don't live in an English speaking country and to top it off lol I live on island far from the city. I've also heard that the dentists here will try to get you to do as many procedures with them as they can. So yes I'm happy with the two procedures the dentist I go to now has done. I'm just surprised that she said the back teeth needed to come out.I'm due for a crown and cleaning next week. The dental work I'm confused on are braces and implants. Should I get invisalign before I get the implants/fillings etc or get the teeth healthy and then start with invisalign?I asked the dentist, but the only thing she said is I need to wait on the implants and we were suppose to talk about invisalign on my next visit, but the problem is since she is so far away I usually just have enough time to do the procedure I set the appointment for.Sorry about the long post, but thought some background info might be useful. movemen: The back teeth are probably the wisdom teeth and it is extraction is recommended.

Unfortunately he retired.\nAbout 6 years ago (before I met the abovementioned dentist)  I had an abscess. My previous dentist then wanted to remove 4 teeth! I decided no-way and went for a second opinion. The dentist then did minor surgery on the abscess and it completely resolved with no loss of teeth.

He saved 4 teeth that would have been removed (almost criminally)Current Problem:\nI developed a knob high up above a tooth that was worked on 3 months ago by my new dentist.

DRAVG: having an abscess means that there is some form of infection. From a dental perspective it can be tooth or gum related or both. if it is tooth related then one way to truly get rid of the infection is via root canal therapy. If your abscess is purely gum related (periodontal) then you may not need the root canal. \nthe point is: first identify the source of the infection."

All have been filled right away as soon as dx'd. We had always gone to a pediatric dentist and were very discouraged that he kept getting these cavities. In fact, we started to suspect that they were being a little over zealous in their treatment so we switched dentists to the one my husband goes to who is very good. At son's first visit to the new dentist, the dentist looked at the x-rays from the pediatric and said they didn't need to be filled yet, so we thought we were right in our suspicions. Yesterday, he went to the new dentist and was told he had 5 cavities (3 watches from the previous x-rays and apparently 2 new ones and needed 2 appointments -- again all between the teeth. So, I guess my question what is the typical prognosis for a kid like this. His teeth are not rotting at all, can his teeth last his lifetime? Is a kid like this destined for dentures down the road? My feeling is that typically the people who end up with dentures are not the people who had the treatments (filled cavities) etc and that filling the teeth is fixing the problem. Am I right in this?How long do fillings last? How much do they weaken the teeth, and are fillings between the teeth less damaging to the tooth than those that are not between the teeth.I have (and my husband) have a mouthful of filings and only once every 5 or so years I have to have one replaced. I am 57 and have 1 crown and 1 implant, so I've done ok. My husband is in the same boat and I have to believe that dental procedures are less invasive and better than they were 40years ago and that my son's teeth will last like ours have. As the kids were growing up, I was diligent about reminding them to brush, made sure there was floss available, even flossed them for awhile myself. however, I eventually stopped doing that. My younger son just got lazy though and did not want to take care of his teeth. Hopefully now he will be better.

It could also be just my tongue find the crown irritating and causing me to constantly noticing it.. does anyone else have same issue? movemen: the crown sits above gum line inside is perfectly normal.

Give it some time michaels01: I should add there is one spot in the back of the crown is a bit rough, the dentist says that's where the pocelin wraps around and meets the metal (he says the back of the crown is mostly metal?), is this something he can polish so it's perfectly smooth?also where the crown meets the tooth inside is also a bit rough..I already have this crown for 2 months.. movemen: yes, the dentist can definitely smooth it out but don't expect to feel complete as your natural tooth. michaels01: movemen said:\t\t\tyes, the dentist can definitely smooth it out but don't expect to feel complete as your natural tooth.\n\t\t\nClick to expand...Would I be better served by a prosthodontist as oppose to a general dentist if I want the highest quality on a crown for a front tooth? movemen: Not necessary because its also depends on the lab. Good labs will pay attention to every little details michaels01: how do i know what lab is good or pick a lab? and how do I even pick a good dentist at a first place? movemen: A good dentist clinically is the one that takes his/her time to meticulously prep and take impression of the tooth and when delivering the crown he would check with xray and every aspects to make sure the crown fit right. Also read reviews about the dentist on google or other directories michaels01: I probably have the worst dentist, I went back today to have him smooth out the rough spot, he tried a few times I still have a bit roughness in the back of the crown. he said I will always feel some roughness where the porcelain joins the metal in the back of the crown.. all the while he was impatient like he already spent too much time on this already..would the slight roughness feel smoother over time? I seriously need a new dentist! I wasted my dental coverage on this guy, now if I want to redo the crown I'd have to pay out of pocket.."

My dentist stated that he is not sure if they are decayed but he is unable to tell from the X-Ray. He wants to drill in to see if they are decayed.Does it make sense that an X-Ray will not show decay? I have no pain and they are not impacted.Thanks, MikelHorizon: Well, if your dentist do some cleaning on your tooth I am sure he/she going to figure out if your tooth is decay. movemen: Sometimes the decay might not show up on xray.

    "dialogue": "phh711: I am 60 years old and this is my situation. Upper wisdom teeth pulled right and left. Lower right 3rd from back extracted. Lower left, second from back lost a crown that has not been replaced (~2 yrs ago). Upper left front tooth has a crown that is chipped and needs to be replaced, but I always had trouble with it coming off, and it is now on to where I've been told the only way to get it off is to grind it off (tooth has a post). Fell yesterday and chipped half of upper front right tooth off, no nerve exposed, but 45 degree angle chip. Gums are extremely receded.My question is this... I have EXTREMELY limited financial resources, dental phobia, and am starting a new career where I deal with the public in a sales capacity. Am I at the point where dentures might make as much sense as anything? I know there are trade offs regarding fit and possible looseness, but never could afford braces when a kid, and the idea of a straight white smile seems like it would offset a great deal of the traditional drawbacks. Dr. Garrett Fiorenza: Dentures are a last and final option as far as dentistry goes. If you decide on dentures it will be for the rest of your life, and they could negatively effect your eating ability. Also, you will have to get the rest of your teeth extracted before the dentures can be made. That being said, if you are willing to go through the multiple extractions the dentures will have the ability to straighten and whiten your smile. If you are able financially I would suggest looking into implant supported dentures. With the support of implants the dentures have much greater retention and can help with eating. Hope this helps,Garrett Fiorenza, DDS\nwww.fiorenzadentalgroup.com\nGreenwood, IN movemen: Dentures are absolutely last option because it can never function as efficient as your natural teeth and less taste with food because of all that acrylic covering your palate"

First of all, let me state that I am not implying any dentist on this board is dishonest !! \n      But it seems there are a lot of stories of dishonest dentists. My gf left her usual dentist, since he was expensive and she had lost her dental insurance, and went to a dentist who had a discount coupon advertising himself.

She had the cleaning and exam, and, as you no doubt have guessed, was told she had NO cavities.      That's her story.   My story follows:  I was at my usual dentist, whom I trust, for a cleaning and exam.  But my dentist was not there. for some reason, so I was given  some other dentist, a new one to the group, to do my exam.  The tech, looking at the xrays,  was insisting to the new dentist that I had 2 cavities.

I had cavities filled that never actually existed. The best bet is to do research on your dentist first, ask around, see if you can get opinions, honest ones, from current patients.

People with their backs against the wall financially are liable to do just about anything to cover their basis. Then you have people who just aren't good people to begin with and dentists are no exception. We come out of school a small fortune in debt and many people simply need someone to bridge their finances. However, this isn't new to dentistry and you just have to wonder if we're simply more aware of it now with the availability of information today.A lot of dentists are like auto mechanics in that they may lean towards a procedure that is not altogether necessary. One way to know what you're getting into is to look for as many third party reviews as humanly possible. For example, we have over 150 reviews on our website (coral-springs-dental.com). Obviously this wouldn't be altogether possible if we weren't continually providing a high level of service. There's no guarantee that past great service will lead to feature great service but it tends to be the best indicator.I'm interested in hearing other people's experiences if they care to share. concerneddentalpatinet: I agree with this assessment of dishonesty.  I have had proposed treatment plans extend into the thousands of dollars only to have a second opinion state I had a few minor areas of concern.  It is hard to know who to trust.  I had found the dentist who are more willing to work with you financially tend to be more honest. Ohio Dentistry: Dishonesty & DentistrySadly, I see the same thing in not only dentistry, but other professions both healthcare and otherwise.  It's the same way with attorneys (before I started working in the dental field I was a paralegal).  One attorney might say you need to file a simple form while another might recommend a whole other route, with more time and money involved.  Many times it may be someone trying to make an extra buck by doing unnecessary work, while other times it may be a lack of knowledge or inexperience on the new dentist's part.  Like mentioned above, new dentists can be pushed and pulled to make certain diagnosis by others.  They also may not have the required hands on experience to tell what needs to be treated and what doesn't.  Either way, it's not something you want to encounter when your paying a \"highly trained\" professional.Unfortunately, I don't think this is anything new.  It doesn't matter if you're talking about present day 2013 or 1993, there's always going to be some dishonesty or lack of knowledged in certain industries.  I agree with the comments above that 3rd party reviews can be a great tool. Remember, you don't have to settle, there's always room for a 2nd opinion. movemen: Diagnosis in dentistry is subjective, meaning a dentist can treatment plan differently according to his or her training and experience. In the situation above, one of the cavity might be small but and if that dentist was trained to fill it to prevent future problems then he or she will incline to fill it. In my opinion, if the cavity is small i would just watch it."

    "dialogue": "Adele72: My original dentist said I would need crowns eventually because I had large fillings in 2 back teeth and they can't be refilled. So, I had a 2 back molars prepped for crowns last year by #1 dentist. Afterward, I experienced pain as if I was hit in the face with a bat. I was sent to an Endodontist.\n#1 Endo said it was stress and to get a night guard from the drug store and take Motrin & Tylenol together. #2 Endo said I needed a root canal in one of the prepped molars. When doing the root canal there was difficulty numbing the tooth and the smell was awful when the temporary crown was removed.  RCT completed. No antibiotics were given. I became very sick and my facial pain didn't let up. I consulted another dentist who sent me to #3 Endo since #2 Endo closed on Friday. # 3 gave me steroids, antibiotics and in a week or so I did not feel as sick, I could drive again, return to work, but the pain was not gone. I was dx. with Trigeminal Neuralgia mainly because no problem could be found with the prepped tooth. Months later I finally found someone to put me to sleep put on my permanent crown. Because it could not be put on under noviciane. I came out of sedation when he was drying the tooth to install the crown. I had sensitivity and was sent back to #2 Endo. I was put on Augmentin for 10 days then after no relief the upper molar ground down an upper tooth to prevent contact. After still having no resolve and having tooth pain and face pain, I was told to see an oral surgeon without a referral. Oral Surgeon #1 didn't want to touch it, Oral Surgeon # 2 gave me Kenalog injections with no resolve. #2 Oral Surgeon wanted another opinion. I called all my previous Endo's I had seen to get all of my records together and #3 Endo said, come in and let us have a look. #3 Endo believed I had a fractured tooth. He sent me to an Oral Surgeon who removed the tooth the next day and found it was split in two under the crown. It took me 9 months to have the tooth issue resolved, 7 dentists, 3 Endodontists, and 3 oral surgeons. I'm sure my bite is nothing like it used to be. Now, the tooth doesn't hurt anymore, but I'm plagued by facial pain. What caused this problem? It has now been 1 year and 3 days I've had facial pain, what could have happened? DR. Stephen: I am sorry to hear that you had a bad experience. Based on the details given above, I could see why your dentist decided to do a crown. If there is any infection, the technology is so improved these days that the dentist could see it in a good digital x ray. If you had pain and in your case explained above, it could be because of infection or because your tooth was broken while prepping for crown. Again both could be easily found out on a good bite wing x ray. I would advice you to go to a general dentist who does root canal and surgical extraction in future. At least there would be one person who is accountable for in that case.Dr. Stephen\nDesigners Smiles Dentistry (www.DesignerSmilesDentistryTX.com)"

As he is looking in her mouth, he mentions a couple of white patches, which he says, just in passing, more or less talking out loud to himself, “its not up to me to say what they are, (the white patches) that would be a pathologists job” ……now, the woman hears this, and it gives her pause, to stop and wonder, what he meant by the statement in  passing,, however she does not question him on it.\n In her limited knowledge of the medical profession, she does however know that a pathologists job is to study and test tissues for certain diseases , one of them being cancer. She goes on to think to herself , “Did the dentist possibly see something, that in his mind, needed to be tested for cancer?” and if he did,, why did he not refer her to a doctor who would do such tests.??\nInstead, the said dentist, referred her to a colleague, who would be the one that would make the dentures for the woman. He told the woman, that this dentist would be able to take impressions of what was remaining of her teeth, so he could better build the dentures to fit her mouth.\nThe woman goes to the appointment, with this dentist, telling her he has little to work with, as far as making impressions, and he is going to refer her to an oral surgeon, to have what remaining teeth she has removed, and then she would come back to him, for him to make her dentures, at a cost of $2600, with a follow up visit in 6 months costing $675.\nAt no time, where the white patches brought into question by this dentist. Either he didn’t see them (how is that possible).or he chose to ignore them, (more likely).The entire time, the unspoken question of the white patches  are on the woman’s mind..The woman goes to her appointment for the oral surgeon, and he agrees to extract the remaining teeth, at a cost of $3400. Again, no mention of the white patches. And yet again, did he choose to ignore them??\nThe woman has her teeth extracted, pays the $3400, has the other dentist make her dentures, pays him the $2600, and within two to three months, discovers she has mouth cancer, and her dentures end up in a garage sale within 5-6 months, because the woman is 6 feet under.…………….where, along this chain of events, should someone have told the woman she should see some sort of medical doctor to find out what the white patches were??? or was it up to her to ask?  Should it have came from the first dentist who saw the white patches as being something that should be looked at?? lktknow: After re-reading my post, and also because I have received no replies, I decided to rephrase the question.\n(I do hope you  know that I, certainly know, that dentures are not sold at garage sales? )\nI suppose the question is, if you think or have an inkling that something such as the \"white patches\" would be ignored in order to generate income? It may be a cynical way of looking at it, but isn't it  \"man's inhumanity to man\"? and not exclusive to any profession."

    "dialogue": "kevsta007: My wife is using mouthwash in the place of toothpaste to brush her teeth.  I am wondering if this matters or should she stop this?Wondering what are people's experiences of such a situation.  I am not really after people's personal opinions but what are general accepted practice/wisdom.  I know all of the advertisements say use mouthwash in addition to brushing teeth with toothpaste.   Since this is a professionals forum, what are the professionals experiences of such a situation? LADentalclinic: Hello,\nToothpaste does contain fluoride, abrasives, and detergents that clean and protect teeth, but as long as your wife is brushing at least twice a day and flossing once a day it doesn't really matter that she's brushing with mouthwash. Baking soda straight out of the box or salt are also used by many people instead of toothpaste when brushing.  I personally prefer baking soda over anything else.  It keeps my teeth smooth and bright white.  One of my colleagues grew up in a very large, and poor family.  They could only afford to use salt when brushing.  He's now in his 70's and has never had a cavity, and still has all of his own teeth. MikelHorizon: I agree, baking soda works a lot in whiting our teeth, also it's not expensive and affordable to everyone. Sabrina: I do that, too. I can't even remember the last time I bout toothpaste. movemen: Also remember to floss."

    "dialogue": "Rsh1985: So I just got back from seeing a new dentist and I've been quoted on approximately $12,000 worth of dental work to be done over the next year. My dental insurance isn't great and I am very stressed and overwhelmed. The work includes: a new crown, 4 onlays, a couple of fillings, root scaling/planing, a mouth guard for night time (apparently I grind my teeth), and IV sedation (I have dental anxiety). My last appt with another dentis about 1.5 years ago resulted in the dentist telling me I needed to replace that crown(so I'm not surprised about that part in this current estimate). This new dentist is extremely detailed, thorough-- he breaks his new patient appts into two parts- the first is X-rays and pictures (lots of high tech stuff), then he studies all that stuff, and the next appt a week later is your cleaning and then a 1 hour \"treatment plan\" session (!!!) NOT with him, but with his wife who is basically the office manager.  I called back when I got home to see if they could email me the full 12k invoice/ quote and I was told that they don't do that since there's a lot of \"confusing dental jargon\" that wouldn't make sense to me. Overall I'm just really uncomfortable about all this. I want a healthy mouth but this seems like a bit much to me. Help!!!! :-( :-( Rsh1985: I should also mention that I did go a few years without my regular dental checkups (I blame no insurance, being in college, and just overall anxiety), but since then I've had 2 root canals/crowns, and have had a full examination by a previous dentist about a year and a half ago that did NOT result in all this necessary work.  I was pregnant between May2012-jan2013, would pregnancy cause that many dental issues (hormone changes, etc)??? LADentalclinic: $12,000 sounds like a lot for the treatment that you've described.  It is also unusual that you are not permitted to have a copy of the treatment plan.  A second opinion is always a good idea if you feel uneasy about the first opinion.  It would be helpful though to have the current treatment plan to compare with the one from the new dentist.  Copies of the x-rays would be helpful too so you won't have to pay for them again.  I'm not sure where you live, but in many  areas a dentist is required to release your records to you upon request. Cathy: $12,000 does seem excessive. There is no harm in a second opinion to compare price and treatment plan options. If you need more information on cosmetic and general dental our dental practice has information that can educate you a little more so when you have a consultation you will understand more about dental terminologyand procedures. Ashton Dental MikelHorizon: I guess have a second opinion to another dentist because $12,000.00 is a lot. Oliver Smith: Hi Rsh 12000 does seem like a lot, these fees should not be this extravagant, this office that has quoted you these fees are out of their mind, the lab charges a fraction, and the time spent in the chair does not constitute your dentist to charge so much, i don't know where you reside, but im from NY and i work for a non-for-profit that helps patients find affordable dental care free of charge. We have recently found a dental office that operates in NYC, does not advertise, or market itself, but the dentists are sweethearts and have helped countless patients, they charge 349 for zirconia crowns (metal free, i know because i just had 4 done by them), in addition they will screen you thoroughly the way an exam should be performed and not try to sell, or get you in anything you cant afford. always look for compassionate dentists and not the ones that were used care salesmen in their former lives.Cheers movemen: I would also get a second opinion"

You just need encouragement to your family, friends and to your lover. Tell your mum to be with you once you decided. drmins: Extraction of the wisdom teeth is a common procedure in dentistry and its strange that you connect the death of your neighbor with it. There may be some other medical condition that sadly led to his death.Visit your dentist with your mom and he can explain you how and how a tooth is extracted. Be bold. And more over,be  cool.

What do you think: is that possible or might have more severe consequences? Right now I feel no pain. Dr. M: I would not recommend that, you going to spend lots of money on something that will fail. Extract and place implant. Much better long term result. kurtrichards: Hi Dr. M, is implant recommended to have at the age of 21? kurtrichards: Hi Dr. M, I just extracted the tooth according to your advice. But could I ask you one more question? I will attach the X-ray of my another tooth below, and you could tell me what you think. That is, is it possible to save it? My doctor said that it will need to get the crown on top of it. But I can't get to the doctor for 4 months, but she said that it's is okay. If I see the dentist in 4 months, I should be fine. What do you think? I'm asking about the middle tooth. Thanks a lot. I very much appreciate your help. drmins: Dear kurtrichards,\nIts good that you extracted the other tooth as Dr.M advised. The option of saving one root and extracting the other was  not a great idea considering the treatment costs and poor prognosis expected.Implants are not contra-indicated at this age,as you worry.And lastly,your x-ray pic is not clear.I would be good if you post a better pic,especially the root portion.If there are no abnormalties in that,you can do a crown for it.Thank you\nDr.mins"

    "dialogue": "Fcroxy: Hiya, new member here looking for some advice. It's going to be long so bare with me  I've always had misshapen teeth from a young age, use to regularly go to the dentist as a child and never had a fear of the dentist. About 12 years ago I had a small removable brace fitted (can't remember what it's called) when I was about 13 in preparation for train track braces (I'm 25 now). A few months before I was due to have braces fitted my parents and I moved to France. From then I never visited the dentist, tbh I can't remember why, maybe I rebelled and refused (the move hit me hard and I acted out to punish my parents in a way I suppose)  I moved back to the UK when I was 18. By that age I felt too 'old' to have braces (silly I know as many people do have them) as all of my friends already had then in their teenage years. Instead I've just let them go to shit (excuse my French) I do brush twice a day but have never bothered flossing etc. I never felt there was any point as they are a terrible shape anyway so why bother. I have a few teeth that have completely broken in half, and they aren't a great white colour either, years of smoking and drinking a lot of coffee.   The appearance of my teeth has always bothered me but I refuse to go to the dentist, I don't know why but something stops me making an appointment, I don't know if it's fear of being told how terrible they are, I see them everyday, I don't need a stranger confirming it for me. I don't have fear as such of the pain or procedures, I've had enough painful operations the past few years having dodge knees and learning to walk again etc.   I've always said I won't visit a dentist until I can afford to have something cosmetic done, but in reality with a young baby now I can't afford it, and doubt I would for a long time either. I've been looking at finances to help spread the cost, but my credit rating isn't the great and I doubt very much I would get accepted. The only other thing I can think of would have all my teeth removed and having dentures. It seems extreme but honestly feels like the only option to finally have a smile that I can be proud of. I have always hated my teeth and get really defensive if anyone mentions them. I also get so uncomfortable if people talk about tooth ache, dentists etc and go very quiet and will stop joining in conversation. I don't smile because of them and always look miserable. I hate my photo taken too as I have a stupid fake closed mouth smile so no teeth are showing at all. I can't even have a nice photo taken of me and my daughter because I always look so miserable or stupid fake smile.   I don't know what I'm looking for really, advice? Personal experiences? Words of wisdom? P.S sorry if this is posted in the wrong place, wasn't sure where to post, not good at using forums lol Kelly Grimes: It's important that such a young age we are already educated by our parents about the importance of taking care of our teeth - oral health is very important. Even though you don't have money as long as you have those good set of  pearly whites, you are already rich.I understand your feeling. When I was a child I used to have bad set of teeth because I did love eating sweets. I even hide them under my pillows. Good thing our family had this family dentist that usually checked our teeth twice a year.Going back to you. Don't lose hope, I guess that your teeth are not that very bad and there are a lot of ways to still fix those teeth of yours. Also, don't be afraid to pay a visit to the dentist, it's one of the reasons why you are having this regret now. Where do you live? Probably I can help you find the best and affordable dental clinics in your area. Just let me know. I'm willing to help. MikelHorizon: Regarding with dentist issue, I still remember when I was a child that I am so afraid to see a dentist because people tease me that as dentist going to inject it is very painful so I have been believing on that for so long. And when I was in high school that's the time I have courage and it's too late already because the dentist needs to extract my teeth. So in your case, see a dentist before it's to late and you wont end up like me regretting."

Teeth will continue to erupt out of the bone if they don't have a tooth opposing them.  This does not happen overnight, but it is important to replace missing teeth. Neeta Smith: Absolutely.\nI suggest to replace your missing teeth lavanyadcruz: The best teeth are your own natural teeth. But sometimes, a tooth is badly damaged or lost. If a tooth is lost, it is important to replace it with an artificial tooth as soon as possible. This will prevent the teeth that are left from drifting out of line and possibly causing jaw problems. Teeth that are out of line are harder to clean and are more likely to get periodontal disease (gum disease) and cavities. If one or more of your teeth are missing, your dentist may suggest replacing your missing teeth with a bridge or a denture. If you need to have a tooth (or teeth) replaced, your dentist may do it, or he or she may refer you to a prosthodontist. MikelHorizon: I totally agree with your dentist,  should replace a denture on the tooth extracted. Ellen Lim: In my opinion you should replace your missing teeth asap. It helps to keeps other teeth from changing position. \nGo to your dentist and ask about your problem. Your dentist will solve your problem."

    "dialogue": "chenche: Are there any consequences I should be aware of with not getting an implant?Some background: I had my second molar removed a couple years back and my dentist told me I was too young to get a an implant at the time. Until recently, I simply left the space unattended and my third molar has shifted into that space slightly (very minor, like 10 degrees). Now I wear a removable denture to fill up that space. Current age: 21Wisdom teeth extracted, brush and floss regularly. alchemistintraining: Well firstly we need to look at which 2nd molar.If it is an upper, then we need to look out for the maxillary sinus, and the schneiderian membrane when putting an implant in. \nWith the lower, not too many problems because the cortical bone is a lot thicker than the upper maxilla.  Another thing to note, boys 'stop' growing at around 18-21, depending on a lot of factors (nutrition, diet, medications etc.). So if the bone is continuously remodelling, then implants can act differently when compared to a mouth that is stable. (wasn't sure of your gender)I hope this help, look into anatomy and implants a bit more. This is just my general understanding of things. Source: dental student. GL! MikelHorizon: Age 19-20 teenager, especially boys, are not considered for implant therapy. Early placement due to continuing growth can lead to unaesthetic results."

    "dialogue": "questionasker: In march of this year I had my regular 6 month dental exam; I had my dental x-rays taken. Perfectly good results; I had no decay. Fast forward 3 months later, I was eating and I felt what I thought was a filling come out of a tooth. I went to my dentist to see if he could replace lost filling. He said tooth was badly decayed, and I needed a root canal. He took x-rays of the tooth and referred me to an endodontist. The endodontist did the root canal, and a week later I was back at my dentist to get a post and temporary crown. After the dentist began to drill my tooth for post, he said crown could not be done; the tooth was decayed below gum line, and a crown would break right off. I feel at a loss, I payed almost $1000 for a root canal to find out I have to have the tooth extracted?!? This does not seem right. How fast can a tooth decay? Shouldn't the decay have shown up in the x-rays I had taken in March? I go to the dentist every six months and take good care of my teeth. I apparently will have to get an implant. jerryD: It depends on a number of factors. \n1. How you take care of your gums and teeth?\n2. Your dental health condition\n3. How big the cavity is?Inadequate brushing and flossing increase more chances to get tooth decay. Always follow a good oral hygiene and keep your gums and teeth healthy. Neeta Smith: A person doesn't just develop cavities just overnight. It typically takes months, or possibly even years, for tooth decay to advance to a point where it requires attention.Conditions like bulimia and anorexia (psychological conditions in which individuals induce vomiting), and GERD (Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease) can create highly acidic conditions in the mouth causing severe erosive damage to teeth. tlcha: I was told by my sons dentist that it takes a long time for cavities to form to a significant decay. However I am going through a situation as well where I was told I had a small filling and went in 3 months later with my dentist which is different from my sons and now I need root canal. I would think the endodontist would have seen that on the xrays they did when you went for the root canal. Britanica: Try taking vitamin D3 for your teeth. I do not have insurance right now and have about 5 or 6 cavities. The only thing that seems to help the pain is taking D3 for a few days.Also, not to bad-rap good dentists out there, but there are shady ones who purposely over look things. Ross Rubino DDS: Many people talk about oil pulling being a natural solution but until studies come and say it's 100% true, stay with traditional healing remedies. \n______________\nRoss Rubino DDS FAGD\nRubino Dentistry\nDentist in Chicago george: When a decay is found under an existing filling, it can progress significantly before patients feel any pain.  Sometimes, the decay can even penetrate into the pulp without casing significant pain.\nThese decays are also difficult to spot on an X-ray, as the filling can mask the decay underneath.Therefore, the question (in my opinion) is not how fast can a tooth decay but when is the  decay actually discovered. JosephRAdorno: Teeth decay occurs if a sticky acidic picture called plaque increases on your teeth along with begins breakdown the surface of the teeth.Eating food and drink high in carbohydrates, specially snacking often between foods, will raise your possibility of enamel decay.If you can't regularly wash your tooth and thoroughly clean between teeth with floss or perhaps an inter dental wash, you have reached a larger risk of tooth rot.People that smoke and are drinking alcohol regularly have reached an elevated risk of tooth decay. MikelHorizon: Tooth decay usually happen when we eat a lot of sweet and  we luck of dental hygiene. That's why we should brush our teeth twice a day, floss and see a dentist every six months."

So I lived with the sensation that they were not and did most of my chewing on the opposite side.Now I discover that a couple of teeth on the opposite side where I do most my chewing are damaged. A large tooth on the bottom that had a root canal and crown long long ago has swollen gum on the cheek side. My current dentist (he's new to me) says this is most likely due to a fracture that cannot be seen with xray. He says the bone has receeded slightly from the root. He recommends pulling this tooth. This is a major chewing tooth I would be sorry to lose. And I am concerned about the prospect of another bridge or an implant.Another tooth on that same side, on top toward the front, also has a crown. This tooth is slightly loose, but there is no gum issue or damage otherwise. My dentist says something seems to be damaging the teeth on this side.

During that time I have dealt with tons of pain then the pain got better after 4 weeks but has had a constant pressure feeling since day one of filling. the endodontist wants to do root canal. She says nerve is inflammed but it is not infected. So can a new filling actually calm the nerve and could it recover? The endodontist says once the nerve is inflammed is usually cant recover. I had a composite filling done on top of amalagam filling. Now i am wondering if I have the old composite filling removed and have an amalgam put in, could that calm the tooth down and recover?\nI am asking because the filling is not near the nerve and it is an average filling but is causing all this havoc. I dont have money for root canal plus I had wisdom teeth surgery 3 months ago and dont want to go through so much stuff. Any dentist out there that can respond to this. DDSSAW: Dear tlcha\nWhen a tooth has a “cavity” it really means there is bacteria inside the tooth. Once the bacteria get past the enamel part of the tooth the body has no way of naturally getting the bacteria out. The bacteria will keep eating until they eventually reach the nerve of your tooth. Dentists combat this infectious spread by using a small drill to remove the infection and then fill the hole with either composite or amalgam. Any time a Dentist works on a tooth there are risks associated with treatment. The risk is usually low around 1% that treatment can result in a “complication.”\nTo fully answer your question I will explain a little bit of the anatomy of a tooth. A tooth is composed of three parts, the enamel (hardest substance in the body), the dentin (similar to bone) and the pulp (nerve of the tooth). The pulp is the part that supplies blood and nutrients to the cells inside our teeth. In a normal tooth this nerve helps us detect hot and cold, as well as provide sensory information so that we don't bite down on something hard such as a rock and break our teeth. The nerve is a relatively large space inside the tooth, but the only way blood and nutrients are allowed into a tooth is through a tiny hole at the very end of the tooth called the \"apical foramen.\" In a normal tooth there is a tiny artery and a tiny vein that travel through this tiny hole and supply everything the tooth needs for survival.\nIf you hurt yourself (such as a cut) your body will release signals to other cells calling for help. These cells will rush to the site and cause inflammation and swelling. This inflammation is a good thing because it normally helps your body repair itself faster. The problem is it has an opposite effect in a tooth.\nWhen a tooth gets hurt it sends out the same call for help. The problem is that tiny hole we talked about earlier called the “apical foramen.” As the pulp of the tooth becomes inflamed it builds up pressure inside the tooth. This pressure cuts off the blood supply at the tiny hole strangling the tooth. Once the tooth loses blood supply it’s only a matter of time before it dies.\nWhat happened in your situation?The Dentist removed your amalgam filling and replaced it with a composite filling. During this process your pulp became inflamed which cut the blood supply to the tooth. Right now your tooth is in the process of dying and there is nothing that can be done to stop it. You could put amalgam back in, but it would more than likely accelerate this process. Once the tooth dies it will stop hurting, but at any time it could abscess and cause potentially life threatening issues. My recommendation would be to get the root canal and avoid further pain.\nSorry for the bad news…Dr. Steve Dr. M: Did you see your dentist for bite adjustment? Most common pain after composite restorations are from a high restoration that once adjusted has a great chance to calm down. I have had many recently filled teeth calm down after one or two bite adjustments, but depending on the size of the filling, or presence of cracks a root canal can also be possible, however I would first check the bite and occlusion.\nDr. M"

Since it is the weekend they are closed.  It feels like the sandy bone is staying in place but I am not sure what, if anything, I should do until Monday? Dr. M: If the area is not bleeding and the graft appears to have stayed in, I would just be careful and not eat on that side. If area is bleeding and graft is coming out, place tea bag and gently bite until bleeding stops and see your dentist monday for evaluation."

    "title": "Root canal and crown question",
    "dialogue": "bwspot: I went to dentist for routine checkup. After Xrays I was told that i had a cavity and i need a crown as cavity is too big for the feeling.  My tooth was prepared for the crown.  The space between feeling and nerve after preparation was about 1.5-2mm so doctor put some liquid to see if I will be able to have a crown with no root canal.  After few days I started to have lots of pain and sensitivity to cold.  I went to doctor and told her about it and she performed the root canal without even checking my tooth sensitivity.  She said she is 100% sure that i needed it.  After the root canal I had terrible pain in the gums area every time i would bite on the tooth with the temporary crown.  It lasted for 2 weeks and then I got the real crow, but i was not happy with it as it felt too high. The doctor checked it and told me that i am probably feeling it too high as this is new to me.  I was 100 sure this is not right, but she corrected little and said all fits perfect.  Now when i slide my bottom jaw over top i always feel the crown when i hit it.  On the other side I don’t feel anything when i slide.  What i feel since then is the sensation that my gums are swollen or sore and the feeling does not want to go away.  I suspect the crown is too high and probable when I sleep I press on it a lot and put too much pressure on the gums leading to pain.  I would like to know if:\n- Should i have the root canal done right away or maybe it was worth to wait few more days to see if the pain would go away\n- Why after root canal i had such a terrible pain, is it because it was done incorrectly and too harsh and the damage to the gums was too much\n- should i feel the crown when i slide my bottom jaw over top\n- is my pain caused by high crown LADentalclinic: Without seeing an x-ray I cannot say whether or not I agree that you needed the root canal.  Some soreness after a root canal is experienced by some people, but a root canal is the removal of the nerve, so the pain shouldn't be severe.  It absolutely sounds like your crown is too high.  This will not correct itself.  The crown must be adjusted or the ligament surrounding the tooth will continue to be inflamed and you will continue to feel pain.  I would return to the dentist and have the crown adjusted.  Don't leave until your bite feels even.  Your sense of feel is more accurate than the articulating paper that we use to check the bite.  A bite that is too high will not correct itself.  \nBest of luck to you. bwspot: LADentalclinic said:\t\t\tWithout seeing an x-ray I cannot say whether or not I agree that you needed the root canal.

I will go back to doctor but this time a different one and get the crown checked..  The doctor that did that was nice but was insisting that what i feel is not true and there is nothing there that is on the way.  The doctor also trimmed one of the fillings on the opposite site of the crown to when was trying to correct the problem and that is what completely drove me nuts.  Why to touch the old filling?  The new crown is the root cause of the problem not old filling.  Now i can sense that old filling is trimmed and all area around the tooth is sharper due to it and probably soon it will fall apart as it should not be touched at all. LADentalclinic: A second opinion would be a good idea, but your new dentist may or may not want to adjust a new crown that another dentist did.  Some types of crowns can fracture if they are adjusted a lot.  A new dentist may not want to be held responsible if this happens.  I hope you get some relief soon. bwspot: LADentalclinic said:\t\t\tA second opinion would be a good idea, but your new dentist may or may not want to adjust a new crown that another dentist did.

I spoke to my original dentist and I asked to adjust the crown.  She adjusted it and it felt much better,  but after two weeks I still feel the gums under the tooth.  It is weird as the root canal was done and now the whole area is more sensitive then before.  I feel like the damage to the nerves where they connect with the gums was so intrusive that it affected that area and now i will be stuck with it forever.  Its not like the pain is super strong,  but it bugs me.  I feel something and it changes with the weather.  Before anything was done i did not have any sensation.  If i grab that tooth with my finger and try to move it I feel some discomfort.  Also,  I am not sure how the crown should be adjusted,  but in my opinion maybe it is just too big.  On the right side where everything is ok,  I feel like that tooth is smaller and no matter how i slide my jaw i cannot hit it.  I got some x rays, but they did not get me one that shows the tooth after it was prepared for the crown.  I am suspecting that although i had sensitivity,  if i would wake 1 week or so the tooth might adjust and i would not need the root canal.  See attached if you can tell anything. LADentalclinic: I've posted a radiograph that shows what a root canal should ideally look like.  The white lines going down the tooth is the fill material.  It should extend down to the tips of the roots.  Yours appears to be short.  That could explain why you're still experiencing sensation on that tooth.  All of the nerve wasn't removed. bwspot: LADentalclinic said:\t\t\tI've posted a radiograph that shows what a root canal should ideally look like.

Does it mean that on the attached photos where I marked the fillings at the end in red color they should extend longer?\nAlso, is it possible that they could just tell me to wait some time after they prepared for the crown before going straight to the root canal?\nI think what they did is called the pulp cap.\nOnce I told the doctor that the tooth was sensitive to cold she immediately decided to do the root canal without any further testing.\nI have an appointment tomorrow to check it again.  I will try to get that xray after they did the pulp cap before the root canal.How should I handle this situation?\nI feel like i have nothing to say and doctors are frustrated that i ask too many questions?\nCan they just screw (excuse my language) tooth and be no liable at all?My original doctor is very nice, but the lady who did the root canal cannot just walk away.\nIt is sad that dentist can just do whatever and then just say that anything can happen cause it is complicated. LADentalclinic: Yes.  The white fill material (gutta percha) should extend all the way to the tips of the roots.  The only way to get it down that far is to file and clean the inside of the tooth all the way down to the root tips removing all of the nerves.  A tooth with a root canal is a dead tooth and should have no feeling if done properly.  The x-ray that I posted shows a textbook example of a successful root canal.  It is not unusual for a tooth with a temporary crown on it to be sensitive to cold because of the fragile material of the crown and the trauma of the crown prep.  Whether or not you really needed a root canal is impossible for me to say, but your root canal fill is definitely short.  That part is obvious.  You might tell them that you got a second opinion and was told that the root canal fill is short which could cause the tooth to become re-infected now or in the future.  If necessary the root canal can be re-treated.  You may consider a consult with an Endodontist (root canal specialist) if the tooth continues to give you problems. I'm sorry you're in this situation.  I hope you get some relief soon. bwspot: LADentalclinic said:\t\t\tYes.

I will definitely use  your wording at my visit.\nYou said the tooth with root canal should have no feeling.  Does it mean that mine has some instead of gutta percha?\nAlso,  the sensation I experience is that dull or swollen feeling around the area around the tooth. It is not sharp pain.  It kind of feels like the pain around the wound that heals.\nCan this be a cause of a post trauma after the crown preparation and later root canal or is side effect of the improper root canal treatment?\nOr can this be also due to the crown being still too big and somehow pressing on the gums all the time and therefore not allowing it to heal?\nThere was a lot of pain around the tooth after the crown preparation and later the root canal.\nI vedentis: Yes your advice is also very helpful for me. Now I am very happy after pain relief. bwspot: Sorry for not posting the results of my dentist visit but new problem developed that threw me off.\nSo I went to check my tooth on june 10th and they told me that root canal was done property and it was long enough.\nThey said that bite was also good and that the could not adjust it anymore as it would be wrong. \nDuring the voyage with the dentist and tooth problem I spent some time with some music experiments.(mostly listening to different audio equipment and few times to the tone generator, not super loud)  Same week after the dentist visit on Friday the 13th i started to get ringing in the ear.  It has been on since then.  It freaks me out as I cannot sleep.  I almost forgot about my root canal, but today I started to think that maybe the root canal and ringing are correlated and ringing is not a cause of music listening, but the root canal.  I do still feel uncomfortable with that new crown.  I can feel it and when i touch the tooth and try to move it I feel discomfort and sensation that something under the crown is not OK and gums feel still not healed.  I never felt uncomfortable when i was listening to the music and never got any ringing after it as music was not loud.  The ringing that started happened during the silence just out of nowhere,  I went to MD to check for infection but they did not see anything wrong.  They prescribed some decongestant medicine and told me to go ENT if the ringing does not go away.  I started to read more about ringing and all points to the Tinnitus but I cannot believe that this could happen.  I am 39.  Yesterday I massaged my neck and the jaw (both sides) for 10-15 minutes and later I hung on the inversion table.  I repeated it twice.  I went to bed and just like that ringing in the right ear went away but the one on the side when root canal was done did not stop.  I woke up with ringing in both ears again.  Not sure how the massage could be related or the inversion table. (hanging upside down)  Is it possible that my problems are related to the root canal and massaging or hanging affects something like sinuses or nerves that fixes the problem?  (not every time) Not sure what to do now? If i go to ENT they might diagnose me incorrectly if they don't take the root canal into the consideration.  Please help or point me into the right direction. bwspot: Anyone can give me an advice of possible ringing as side effect of root canal?  I need to decide if I should go first to different dentist to check the root canal work before i go to ENT.\nWhat would you recommend? My doctor told me to go to ENT but because the tooth still does not feel like i am suspecting that maybe it is a root cause of my problems. bwspot: I went to root canal specialist and I was told the root canal was not done property.  I was told the feelings were too thin and too short.  I am haveing it redone today.  I hope it will fix all my problems. bwspot: So i had the root canal redone.  So far i don't feel too much of the difference.  I do start wondering if my root canal was actually done incorrectly or the root canal specialist just wanted to make money on me and redid it.  I am having hard time trusting any dentist I see.  I also went to another dentist and I was told my crown needs to be corrected as there is little empty space between the crown and the tooth.  Here I wonder again is it really the case or they just want my money? Nicolas: I guess you should have avoided crown because it is the reason that causes you pain and definitely requires root canal in which the dead nerve is removed. You will experience pain for some time after going through root canal. I feel the problem is with the high crown and it needs to be readjusted. I think its better to consult another dentist to fix this problem."

    "title": "Jaw would not close after procedure",
    "dialogue": "Jeffrey: Hey all, quick question I was hoping I could get an understanding about. I had a root canal done, tooth #2. It's difficult to describe, but I'm sure most of you have experienced that when you open your mouth as wide as possible, there's a certain point where you have \"clicking feeling\". Well, I had my mouth opened as wide as possible for a root canal, past that clicking feeling.  For some reason I thought there was something in my mouth holding it open, so I did not relax my jaw for about 30 minutes. When it was time for me to close, I couldn't. My jaw would get to a certain point, still very wide, and would simply stop, sharply, as if I were biting something solid. I was convinced there was something in my mouth. Clearly I panicked. It took a solid 2 minutes of the Dentest massaging my temple area, and the dental assistant talking me down before it finally \"popped\" and I was able to close it.  \nCan someone tell me what was going on there?\nI googled lock jaw, but only found information on jaws that would not open.  Any ideas on how to prevent this in the future?  Thanks! \nJeff. DDSSAW: JeffreyThis is a common situation that arises when a patient opens their mouth for long periods of time. Your lower jaw's joint is called the TMJ or temporomandibular joint. The TMJ is a complex joint that is associated with lots of painful problems in dentistry. Within the joint there is a small \"disk\" that your lower jaw uses to rotate and slide on. When you first begin to open your mouth your lower jaw (mandible) rotates, but as your jaw opens past a certain point your jaw will begin to slide forward down a slope. Your lower jaw uses this \"disk\" like a cushion to slide down this slope. It's similar to a person sliding down a slide on a inner tube. This disk is attached to a small piece of tissue that prevents it from sliding too far down this slope. Every once in a while your mouth will open so wide that lower jaw will slide down the slope further than the disk can travel. A good way to think about this is you are sliding down a slide on a inner tube that has a rope attached to it. Now once the slack in the rope runs out the tube will stop, but you will keep moving and be thrown from the tube. The only way back to the top of the slide is by walking up the same slope you came down, but now there is a tube in your way. You must get back on top of the tube for the people at the top to pull you back.What happened in your case was that your lower jaw opened further than your \"disk\" could travel. Your lower jaw opened so wide that it fell off the disk and was stuck in front of it. Now this is a scary thing when patients experience it for the first time and they often tense up their muscles. Your Dentist did the right thing by massaging your muscles and getting them to relax so that your lower jaw could \"pop\" back on top of the \"disk\" and resume normal function.How to avoid this?Next time ask your Dentist for a \"Bite Block.\" It's a cushion that you can rest your teeth on while the Dentist works and should prevent this from happening in the future.Hope this helps!Dr. Steve"

    "dialogue": "tlcha: I had 2 wisdom teeth that were impacted and one had cyst extracted over 2 months ago. Then i went in to dentist and had what was suppose to be 2 small fillings is now turning into terrible pain and sensitivity and pressure in those composite fillings for a month now. It stinks because now I may need root canals in both those teeth. These teeth are right next too the wisdom teeth that were extracted. I am wondering if anyone out there has gone through this? I am concerned that this is too much. I wanted my body to heal more but I cant stand hurting everyday and taking ibuprofen everyday. My teeth didnt even hurt before I had these fillings. ugh! LADentalclinic: Wisdom teeth extractions wouldn't cause teeth to become infected and need root canals.  If your teeth are hurting that badly your fillings cannot be small.  The deeper the filling the closer it is to the nerve chamber and that's what causes pain and sensitivity.  The other possibility is that you're hitting the fillings too hard.  If your bite is off you would also experience tooth pain.  This is the easiest thing to check and adjust first.  Either way the wisdom teeth extractions would not be the culprit. tlcha: Thank you for responding. I know wisdom teeth are not the culprit. I went back to oral surgeon to check it out. I was told they were small fillings initially. However the one filling on lower 2nd molar the decay was close to nerve. On the upper 2nd molar it was small but then the dentist saw another cavity on same tooth opposite side of it that she did not see on xray. Seemed like she drilled an awlful lot. I cant imagine how that did not show up on xray, yet she drill quit a bit. Then she said to me, you want composite filling, right? I said yes , why? She said because algam is easier for me because of where it is located. Never had a dentist reply like that. She did put the composite filling in there . When I got home I was in excruiating pain from that filling. Never had a dentist make me hurt like that from a filling. I called and the dentist said she thought it was the bands she put around the tooth making me hurt. When she used the band it pinched my lip and I put my hand up so she knew what was going on and fixed my lip. Now I am wondering what that band did to my tooth since I have had constant pressure in both teeth since the fillings. I only mentioned the wisdom teeth to let you know what I been through, trying to sort this all out. The oral surgeon did some tapping on my teeth and the upper one was more sensitive than the lower one. He also adjusted bite for the 2nd time.If it isn't better soon I will go to endodontist. I mentioned these were small fillings because that is what the dentist told me initially. Then she said the lower one was deeper than she realized. I have no clue what happened with the upper one. That was not suppose to be close to nerve and was suppose to be small but that one has hurt as much as the lower one. I think something happened while she was working on that tooth. Going through wisdom teeth surgery is enough recently and now to deal with root canals. Britanica: Try repairing the damage before your get them done. Vitamin D3, cod liver oil, and natural butter (local farmers) would do wonders for your teeth. You don't want to over-load your body with so many things happening at once. Allow it time to heal. For pain, do some oil pulling with coconut or olive oil. This also cleans everything quite well. Do a few peroxide soaks as well. Hold the peroxide in your mouth over the teeth for 5 to 10 minutes."

I read on the internet the minute the dentist starts filling tooth there is always potential for root canal. Well I have had tons of fillings crowns root canal on teeth since I was young. I am 49 now. Never experienced pain after coming home from having a filling. I say Bolony to you dentist. Dentist, endodontist etc make a ton of  money and I truthfully cannot afford 2 root canals and really dont want to do that to my body so soon. The dentist should not have me in so much pain after a filling unless something happened when she did it. It took 4 weeks for pain to go away but the reason I am going to endodontist is because I continue to have tons of pressure in the teeth like I did day one of the 2nd filling. I did not have it during the 1st filling for a whole week. crazy. I aslo have sensitivity to cold, however it seems to get better as the days go on except for the constant pressure.I know a good dentist when I have one, Right now I dont think that is the case. I moved to a new place, my old dentist, I never went through this."

In the +40 years since I've never had a single problem with any of those teeth.In the last few years I had a couple more root canals (and crowns), each requiring a trip to an outrageously expensive $pecialist where the staff practically gasped when I pulled out a credit card instead of a dental insurance card. Their reaction was as if I was trying to buy a BMW, or even a house. After a flurry of keyboard clicking, no doubt checking to see if it was fraudulent/stolen/overdrawn/badcredithistory/whatever, followed by signing papers to give them my first born male if payment was somehow not processed, then they let me through to get the root canal. Whew.I still have occasional pain two years after where the $pecialists did the root canals. The dentist was clueless as to why. Another of the more recent crown hurts if there is lateral pressure put on it. Another clueless dentist said he can't find anything wrong.Last month I had to have another root canal when I cracked a tooth. At least I found a place open on weekends as I was in extreme pain. Expensive as hell, even though they were moving people through like cattle. Some 30 booths (not kidding!) manned by 3 dentists...excuse me, $pecialists, running from booth to booth as needed. Sort of fast-food type dentistry. The over crowded waiting room was like being at the DMV. Then I had to wait 3 weeks for the crown, which didn't fit right, so I have to wait another 3 weeks. The temporary cap has fallen off twice in the last 3 days. I told them I'll just leave it out.From my perspective, dentistry not only has become way too expensive, but has actually gotten worse. For all their new high tech gadgets, dental care is declining instead of improving. I'm now glad I got those 6 molars done right way back when."

    "dialogue": "Chuck: Just joined so I hope this is the correct area to place this subject.\nI will try to keep this simple and short. I have been feeling very run down for quite some time and for no apparent reason I have had 3 upper teeth simply die so I had them removed in 2 different session (#3, 4, & 14). Three days after the extraction of tooth #3 (the most painful tooth) some long term stomach bloating completely went away (strange I know). None of the 3 teeth showed any signs of decay or cracks on 3 different types of x-rays (Bite wing, Panoramic or Cone Beam) and also no signs of swelling or bleeding around the gums. Certainly the dentist did not want to remove them but I insisted. After each of the 3 extractions the dentist cut the teeth open and indeed all 3 were hollow inside (To his surprise). \nThe strange thing is that it has been 4 months since the last extraction and now the teeth next to the extraction sites are hurting just like the previously removed teeth but they too look normal and my gums look healthy. I still feel run down but I can take a simple antibiotic (such as a 5 day Z-Pak) and I feel very energetic again but it only lasts for about 2 weeks tops. I was tested using a Cavitat machine for a cavitation in the jaw bone and one was found in the lower right jaw bone where I had a wisdom tooth removed 30 years ago. I had that site treated with 12 weeks of ozone injections just to be safe (which is and always was a pain free site to begin with). I am on my 4th general dentist now and each one is more baffled than the last.My questions are: \n1) Can there be some type of mysterious bacteria or infection under the gum or in the jaw that is destroying my upper teeth but might be very difficult to detect? (And maybe the reason I feel so run down?)2) If there is a chance that this could be tested or diagnosed by some type of Specialist/Dentist/Dr, what type of Specialist should I search out? I am thinking maybe they can do a culture and send it into a lab to see if there is indeed a sign of infection or bacteria that can be identified?Thank you in advance, I appreciate any suggestions."

That's why it burned when you swallowed it.  Most dentists use what's called a rubber dam when doing root canal therapy.  In fact, in some areas it is required that dentists use it.

Can that mixture of water and bleach block the air-way when making contact? or is it just that my throat is very sensitive? LADentalclinic: You are not sensitive.  The warning label on bleach says, \"Danger. Corrosive.  Do not drink or eat directly.  Call a poison control center or doctor immediately for treatment advice.\"  Fortunately during a root canal the bleach is diluted with a large amount of water, but it is unusual that you were still exposed to the solution while wearing a rubber dam.  If you are still experiencing symptoms be sure to seek medical attention. sawblade60: Would a dentist want to stop and find out what just happened if the patient couldn't breathe because he or she swallowed sodium hypochlorite and there throat was burning real bad and the patient is saying over and over \"I Can't breath\"? The dentist I had just wanted to finish doing the root canal and figured I must have swallowed down the wrong pipe. After having this happen to me I told the dentist that I wanted to stop and come back another day to finish the root canal and when I came in that next time, my dentist said to me that she didn't think what I experienced was bad as I made it out to be and that I must have swallowed water and it went down the wrong pipe. Most people that have a fear of going to the dentist have a fear of the drilling and needles and how much pain they are going to be in but I never seen it coming that I would be more fearful of what I might end up swallowing in fear of not being able to breathe. I think that what bothers me the most about what happened to me is that the dentist only cared about getting her work done. I will never go in blind again to have a root canal and I will never have that dentist do one on me again but what's going to be hard to overcome is when I have anything done to my teeth including cleaning regardless of who's doing it is when I feel anything liquid running in my mouth,I'm going to get scared of swallowing. Whatever they call it I had a bad reaction to sodium hypochlorite and you would think that no matter what it is, if it stops you from breathing, stay away from being in contact with it if you plan on wanting to stay alive. LADentalclinic: It sounds like your dentist isn't very considerate.  I'm sorry that you had such a traumatic experience.  Patient comfort should be the number one consideration.  Fortunately sodium hypochlorite is only used during root canals, so you shouldn't encounter it during any other dental procedure. sawblade60: LADentalclinic said:\t\t\tIt sounds like your dentist isn't very considerate.

After having my bad experience with sodium hypochlorite I will not come near that stuff again.. When something stops you from being able to breath, it gets your attention real fast and you don't forget it... LADentalclinic: No. After many years in dentistry I would have to say that I've never heard of a root canal being done without sodium hypochlorite.  It is pretty standard.  Your experience was very unusual.  During a normal root canal, the sodium hypochlorite is rinsed into the tooth and suctioned out at the same time.  It should not come in contact with the inside of your mouth or your throat at all. Hopefully you will never need another one, but if you do you might try going to a different dentist. sawblade60: Is it normal to have to sign a consent form by your dentist when having a root canal done? LADentalclinic: Consent forms are routine in dentistry because there are so many lawsuits.  Many offices have their patients sign a general consent form during their first visit that covers all procedures.  It is also customary to sign a consent form before surgical procedures acknowledging any possible complications.  Being asked to sign a consent form before treatment is not in itself a red flag. sawblade60: LADentalclinic said:\t\t\tConsent forms are routine in dentistry because there are so many lawsuits.

    "dialogue": "Jordi: Hello. I need some advice. I am very frustrated. It all started two years ago when I had a root canal done on tooth number 5 because of tooth pain. Since the pain never went away I went back to my endodontist to check if something had been missed. He told me that the root canal job looked o.k. and that he couldn't help me any longer because my pain was a \" phantom pain \".After enduring the pain for over two more years I went to see another endodontist who recommended a retreatment. I had the retreatment done last Wednesday and a temporary crown placed (a week ago) but the pain is worse than ever. I went back to see the dentist who placed the temporary crown, and he realized that my upper palate is quite red. He referred me to an oral surgeon but the oral surgeon just kept telling me how frustrated he felt because he didn't know why I was still hurting. I feel pain on my upper palate near tooth 5, and the pain gets worse by touching that area. It is also painful when I bite with that tooth but only at a specific angle or by tapping on the tooth. Also by drinking liquids.\nThe oral surgeon said that the tooth could have a small crack but it could not be seen on X rays. He talked about a machine that he has that might be able to detect cracks but there is no guarantee, and it is expensive, so I decided to wait. The oral surgeon prescribed Peridex and amoxicillin and the dentist prescribed a narcotic. I bought Advil too. They don't seem to help. My pain radiates up to my right eye through my right cheek.I am scheduled with the dentist to place the permanent crown in three weeks, which is now being built in the lab, I don't know what else to do. Will I have to undergo this pain the rest of my life?Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.Best regards,Jordi"

Thank you. LADentalclinic: From the x-ray I can see that the decay is definitely into the nerve of your tooth.  When this happens you must have a root canal or an extraction.  It sounds like your dentist doesn't think that he can restore the tooth after the root canal because of how far the decay extends under the tissue.  I've had a lot of questions lately about extractions changing the shape of the face.  That occurs more often with anterior or front teeth.  Having one molar extracted is not going to prematurely age your face. Tman: LADentalclinic said:\t\t\tFrom the x-ray I can see that the decay is definitely into the nerve of your tooth.

They provide some scary pictures, which probably will get more than a few people paying money.If they are providing misleading info, then the appropriate dental body should correct them.

During a dental exam the hygienist will check for pockets around each tooth.  3 millimeters or less is considered normal. 4 millimeters or more is a cause for concern.

Because of that I have never been consistent with taking care of my teeth. Although I know how bad it sounds now,  their were times where i would go over a month without brushing.  I was also a smoker for more than 15 years and occasionally chewed tobacco.  I've never had any issues with my teeth other than bleeding gums bc i brushed so infrequently. About 6 months ago,  I stopped drinking alcohol and smoking, and I started brushing my teeth every day.

It's better to focus on the present and the future.  It's great that you're taking good care of your teeth now.  A soft toothbrush is definitely the only kind that you need to use.  Have you gone in for a professional cleaning?  Without seeing you in person, I cannot say whether or not you have gingivitis or gum disease.  A professional cleaning will reach areas that you cannot clean yourself and will help to get your gums back into good shape.  Sometimes the hygienist will also prescribe a rinse that will help with bleeding.  She will also make sure that you are using the proper technique when brushing and flossing so you don't inadvertently cause additional damage. AJay: I would like to share my recent experiences with Dentists, I had not been near a dentist since I was around 16,shocking yes! I put it off for many many months, I was making appointments and never following them through, it was my worst nightmare to be honest, and around 3 months ago I registered with a dentist, I went for a check up, since regularly attending I have changed my whole outlook, and, ever since my first extraction only a week ago, I was more than just terrified, I was ready to throw up!! now, I am a completely changed person, I shall be going in a weeks time for another extraction, and, now I know what its like! the injection was nothing like I thought it would be, I felt absolutely nothing!! thanks to my wonderful dentist, I will never look back"

I have been reading science journals and internet postings about the subject of Regenerative Dentistry or as some refer to as Tooth Regeneration. We know that researchers and dental scientists are working on and trying to eventually regrow whole new teeth. They are using different techniques.  One of the most common is stem cell development.  There are now materials, in the lab, that when applied to teeth can possibly reverse tooth decay. There are also other processes that can stimulate the growth of tooth materials dental pulp, cementum, and dentin.  Scientist are also working on regenerating tooth enamel the hardest part of the tooth that does not grow. My question, Is there any new research that can be found leading to the natural biological repair and replacement of existing dental cavities and their artificial fillings?  Are we any closer to growing (regenerating) parts for teeth and replacing artificial tooth filings with natural biological grown fillings made from real dentin and enamel?  Some say that this technology may be possible within 5 to 10 years and will most likely be developed before whole teeth can be regenerated from scratch.  What is your opinion and reasoning on this subject?Several dentists seem to avoid answering this questions because they either simply do not know or do not want to make predictions.  I would like to know if there is a way of to receive more information in this area if possible. I have tooth fillings and would like, or hoping, to one day have them eventually replaced with natural grown tooth material. vedentis: If biological grown tooth technology is successful.

From your photograph, I would say that it is stain, decay, or stained tartar buildup.  The reason why I can't say for a certainty is because an actual exam is needed.  An instrument called an explorer is used to determine if it is stain or decay.  The sharp point of the explorer is ran along the dark area.  If it sticks it is decay.  If it doesn't it could be stain. If it scrapes off it is probably tartar.  Either way if you want to take care of it you would need to see a dentist. Bugg: Assuming it's the latter, do you know any viable at-home processes for removing the build-up?I imagine that, as a reflection of the build-up occurring, it would mean I have not been brushing well enough as well.

I originally went to the dentist wanting to get an implant and discussing the pros and cons with him (and the expense) after that we decided that a bridge would be the best option. \nI did a bit of research on the topic and went originally to a dentist and was quoted 5K for the implant and it was my second opinion dentist that told me about the bridge option - which of course was a lot cheaper. About 4 days after having the bridge and associated crown, the tooth directly under the crown broke. About 1/4 of the top of the tooth broke off. It always felt as if the crown was pushing a little too much on this tooth. I know this could be random but it seems to me that the tooth (#30 bottom right) broke due to the pressure from the crown above (tooth #3 top right). There is a filling in the tooth that broke. The dentist has not got the best bedside manner and I am not sure whether the crown was probably too big or not. Should he repair the bottom tooth for free - how should I ask about this?\nI probably would rather go to another dentist but then there would be more xrays etc.   Any suggestions would be appreciated.\nCheersSean LADentalclinic: After you got the bridge did your bite feel normal or did it feel like you were hitting the bridge before your other teeth?  If your bite was high it could have contributed to the break on your opposing tooth.  It's difficult to say for an absolute certainty without knowing whether there was a preexisting condition on tooth #30. (decay) Sean: Hi, thanks very much for the replies. Yes it does feel as if the bridge hits the opposing tooth before any of the other teeth. There were no concerns raised from the xrays of the tooth #30 beforehand.\nI think I just have to ask the dentist for his opinion and see what happens.CheersSean DTS: Usually, you can't generate enough force to brake the tooth. If the tooth was intact, you would get a toothache (most likely). Since the portion of the tooth fractured, you probably had micro-fracture there prior to the bridge insertion. Most likely this cusp would brake anyway, just a matter of time. If your bite felt too high, you could have it adjusted. Not sure you can get tooth repaired for free. Good luck."

I do restrict my smile because I have a large crown at the front which causes embarrassment, I have had this for 15 years now.I decided to have a consultation with an Orthodontist who said a brace would provide me with a great smile, but I would need to replace my crown at the end of treatment.I then had a separate consultation with my dentist (who is also an orthodontist - i think) who said if I have a brace then my front tooth would be damaged by the brace and I may lose it because the crown is on a post. He advised me to replace all my front 4 teeth with crowns. Who should I take most confidence in? Surely crowning 3 perfectly good teeth is overkill?Any neutral advice would be great in this stressful situation.Also I have had a quote for £3600 for invisilgn brace, is this ok?All the best. LADentalclinic: It's very hard to advise you without seeing x-rays.  If you have other teeth that need to be straightened orthodontics would be good.  If you are really uncomfortable with both treatment plans you may choose to get a third opinion from another dentist.  Someone that can examine you in person and see your x-rays would definitely be in a better position to prescribe treatment than someone online.\nBest of Luck DTS: I'd go with orthodontist advise. \nYou do not need 4 front teeth to be crowned if you can correct your smile with braces. After going through the braces you might want to change not pleasant looking crown for aesthetics purposes. Post has nothing to do with orthodontic tooth movement. Price for invisalign is about right. Also, crown could be polished and possibly saved, unless you do not like the way it looks, because it's too old."

Looks like you have possible start of the cavity on a distal surface that is not enough to even fill at this point. You have start of the cavity ot he tooth #4 mesial and cavity on the distal surface of the same #4 tooth that needs feeling, you also need a crown for the tooth #30 . You might want to consider closing space between #5 and 6 if it bothers you cosmetically. If it's asimptomatic, I'd not touch #4 at this point. Try second opinion.  Good luck."

    "dialogue": "bbird: Hi,\nI need help with a question please. I had a root canal 14 months ago. Two days ago I woke up with severe pain in that same tooth wich seems to be causing the tooth next to it to hurt as well. My gums around the tooth do not appear to be swollen but are red and bleed a little. It is one of my top front teeth it hurts to bite down and chew. And the pain gets worse at night when I lay down and seems to give me a headache as well. I'm taking exta strength Tylenol as i'am allergic to NSAIDs. Which usually Tylenol always helps my headaches and such but in this case is not helping. So my question is should this be hurting a year later after the root canal? I appreciate any answers I could get!!! Thanks!!! LADentalclinic: Root canals have a very high success rate but it is possible for them to fail.  Sometimes they can be re-retreated, but in some instances the tooth must be removed.  No, it's not normal for your tooth to still be hurting after 14 months.  An x-ray would be needed to determine whether or not the tooth has become re-infected."

    "dialogue": "Grant: Hi,I'm a newby here and after much 'googling' I couldn't find my answer so stumbled across this forum.Here's my story/question:6 days ago I had an upper molar extracted due to a nasty abscess that had formed at the root, the tooth was broken & was re-built about 5 years ago but since then an infection had gotten in & got pretty set in there, it could be felt as a pea sized lump in my gum above my tooth.  Anyway, after a lengthly extraction (not pleasant!) the wound seems to be settling down and healing well, however, I have finished the prescribed course of antibiotics (amoxicillin) and the abscess still seems to be there just as big but even more sore from all the poking around.  My dentist said that it would just \"drain away by itself\" but almost a week in it hasn't improved at all & I can feel it still there even more prominent than ever.  I guess my question is, how long does it normally take for an abscess to go away after the offending tooth has been removed? and when should I be going back to my dentist to get him to have another look at it?Apologies for rambling & Thanks for your patience! LADentalclinic: When an abscessed  tooth is extracted as much of the infection should be cleaned out of the socket as possible.  You should have started feeling better by now.  If I were you, i'd go in for a follow up extraction check.  You may need another round of the same antibiotic or a different antibiotic to get rid of the infection completely."

    "title": "Management of lateral incisor with palatal radicular groove",
    "dialogue": "Juan: Hope I typed that title right.So I have this groove in both my lateral incisors which basically seems to be a mutation that occurs very rarely in people which causes bacteria to accumulate, which in turn causes other gum problems. The dentist says all he can do is open my gum and basically file the groove so that is not so deep, because he says if he fills the grove with anything, my gum will reject the material and I'll get an inflammation. But according to this case study, the dentist used something called \"glass ionomer cement\" to seal the groove and apparently worked out fine. So I wonder if my dentist is ignoring something. Is this \"glass ionomer cement\" kind of a new thing or is it something every dentist would know about?I already have my right tooth filed (but not filled) about one year ago, but there is still a not so deep groove, and I've just got a small inflammation (not as bad as it used to be though) and the dentist said he cannot file it anymore otherwise he'd mess up the tooth, so he just cleaned it a bit and I'm taking ibuprofen. So I'm curious about whether there exist any materials that could be used to fill up the groove. LADentalclinic: Hi Juan,\nGlass ionomer cement is not new.  It's been around for many years.  It's hare to advise you without an examination.  My suggestion would be for you to get a second opinion if you are not confident with the first one.  There are a variety of dental materials available.  Each dentist may prefer different materials and techniques, so a second opinion from a dentist that can look in your mouth would definitely be beneficial."

My dentist temporarily covered the teeth with dental glue (used with braces and other appliances I think) until I can acquire the means to get them permanently fixed, as I need to undergo a procedure to remove part of my gum before I can actually get the teeth covered. In the meantime, I've been wanting to use whitening strips or any variation of a whitening product to improve my smile, but I'm concerned that the color of the glue (which currently matches my teeth coloration) may not whiten and would then look completely ridiculous. Any help on this? Would the glue become whitened, or should I not bother? Thanks! LADentalclinic: I'm not sure what type of \"glue\" the dentist used, but it will not change color if you use whitening products.  Composite fillings, porcelain veneers, and crowns also will maintain their shade.  Whitening products only change the color of natural teeth.  I hope this helps."

    "dialogue": "Jalan: I've got a tough question here, for which I understand there probably is no easy answer.  I have an autistic son, almost 16, who cannot speak, and who sometimes can become violent (such as biting, hitting or pushing).  As regards tooth care, luckily he did not have any serious problem for many years, but it did gradually become more and more difficult even to have a dentist examine him.  We are in Japan, and I don't speak Japanese so well.  Late last year he developed a serious cavity in at least one tooth, but as it wasn't possible for normal dentists to treat him.  Finally, we were referred to a university hospital dental department, where they can put the patient under general anesthesia for treatment.  We were able to go to dentist, but due to his violent tendencies while examining him, the head dentist finally refused to have undergo anesthesia.  It would have to be done at least a couple of times, because a blood and heart test are required prior to the dental treatment.  They say that with time the pain will die down as the nerve dies.  But the pain seems to be continuing, as definitely influences his daily life and behavior.   Any advice? LADentalclinic: Unfortunately, the pain will not \"die down\" until the source of the problem is treated.  It will more than likely get worse.  I would try to find another dental clinic that can treat him with the aid of sedation.  Best of luck. Jalan: Thank you for your response."

Can you tell if you're experiencing tooth pain or gum pain?  If you avoid the area and do most of your chewing on the other side, does the pain subside? If the space is the culprit, crowns would solve this issue.

The pain seems to come and go so I am wondering if its psychological? LADentalclinic: A few weeks of sensation might be normal but definitely not six months.  Also, if you've already crowned those teeth and are still packing food between them, one of them should be redone to create a contact point between them.  A reputable practice would correct this issue at no charge because if left untreated it could result in bone and tissue problems in the future.  If your pain continues I would definitely recommend that you have another dentist check the tooth and give you a second opinion so that you can be sure the root canals were done correctly.

I have full blown panic attacks just thinking about going to the dentist.  On Monday, one of my molars started crumbling.  I have some jaw pain near that tooth.  I have state insurance (medicaid) and do have dental coverage.  I know I will require some form of sedation.  I called every dentist in my area covered by insurance and none of them offer any soft of sedation (wont even write a script for one anti-anxiety med ahead of time).  My husband made an appt yesterday with one of those sedation dentistry places with free consultations.  After bawling my eyes out in the exam room, the dentist said I needed either a root canal or extraction but because I takeother medications for non related health issues (muscle relaxer, nerve pain med, narcotic pain medication, and sleep aid), he would not be able to give me the amount of sedation required.  The dentist recommended a see an oral surgeon.  I did some more research and I think I would be okay with a strong anxiety med before hand and some nitrous.  Well guess what, my insurance doesnt pay for any kind of sedation.  From my research online, it looks like oral sedation is around $400 and nitrous averages $100-200.  I had a thought that maybe I could call my doctor and ask if he would write a script for one anti-anxiety pill (he has done is before any procedures he performs).  Has anybody ever tried asking their doctor for something to easy dental problems?  Would a dentist even treat me if I said I got meds from my doctor since the profit margin on oral sedatives is so high?  Has anybody been in this position, not being able to find a dentist to sedate you due to other meds you take?Thanks for reading and I look forward to any advice. LADentalclinic: I'm not sure why a dentist would refuse to treat you because you received anti-anxiety medication from another doctor.  Dentists don't make money from prescriptions.  Pharmacies and drug companies do.  Checking prices online is not always reliable. Prices can vary greatly from region to region.  You may be able to get a more accurate estimate by calling the clinics that you're considering. You also might want to have a complete exam done first if you haven't already done so.  If you need any other teeth extracted it would be better to have them taken care of at the same time so you only have to pay for sedation once."

Eventually I found it was my lower right rearmost molar, with a white discharge that reeked. I thought maybe it will pass but then I got a bit of pain so decided to go to my GP. He said there was no discharge after squeezing my gums but I insisted there was so he gave me antibiotics (didn't do anything, frankly how would it when this technically an external infection, just in that gap?). Anyways a few weeks later I saw another doctor hoping they would notice and refer me but she said the exact same. So I went to the dentist on my own got x-rays and all my molars are impacted. The lower ones are growing forward rather than up. Dentist told me to get a toothbrush called inter-something but not the wire ones, she drew a diagram of a toothbrush with just a few rows of bristles for cleaning rear teeth. It was not in Boots so I made my own. So I am easily able to clean the place. She also told me to use salt. I did multiple times a day for weeks but it seemed it was drying out my gum and causing it to recede which creates even more odour. WHAT DO I DO???!! The only treatment I can do, makes the smell worse. The dentist won't take out my molar because there's no pain. I'm guessing the only option is private but it's £50 just to see the guy - I can't even imagine how much it would cost to actually have the tooth out. Please tell me what I can do, people at work are noticing and for a year I am embarrassed to talk closely facing people which is almost unavoidable. I haven't seen the discharge in a long time and the gap is pretty big now so I'm guessing it has gone deeper...just sucks. Thanks very much people!"

    "dialogue": "impatient patient: Hi,I confess I've been lurking in a dentist-only forum a bit, where, as a consumer, I was not exactly allowed. It was indeed an eye-opener. The common grievances of dentists seem to be1) patients not caring about their decaying teeth until there is pain (dentists reminding each other not to care more than the patient does and just wait until he/she comes back for extraction/endo)2) ungrateful (and not always poor) charity patients with a sense of entitlement, often a no-show3) patients evaluating dentists by wrong criteria (painless, ease of scheduling, less chair time, in-network, etc) as opposed to longevity of the work; most patients apparently have no idea/don't care whether their existing dental work is any good.4) communication barrier, having to \"dumb oneself down\" in order to be understood by the patients (my words, not theirs!)I've also heard somewhere (not sure it's true) that of all professions, dentists have the highest suicide rate; apparently, because they have to meet people, day after day, year after year, who don't particularly enjoy seeing them.From my standpoint, my surprises were:1) intelligence of dentists, the level of complexity and the pace of change in their field (I thought teeth are teeth are teeth, but no.. it's a lifetime learning)2) the extent and the openness with which dentists are for-profit (I guess that might be because at first they are tied up by having to pay off their student loans and have no choice, and then just get used to making money like crazy?) Sometimes patient is put first, but not always..3) shocking standard deviation of quality of dental work among dentists and even for a given dentist; huge amount of dental work being what in their scientific parlor is called \"crap\".4) among themselves, dentists, especially young ones, seem to have no problem admitting to their shortcomings and that others are superior to them in such and such field; something I, as a patient, have never seen a doctor do. Actually makes me respect them more.5) they often find medical mistakes to be funny (I guess a bit of gallows humor never hurts). On the upper note, they laugh at their own mistakes, too, publicly and with their full name and contact info posted.6) They don't call each other Dr. This and Dr. That (then why do they want us to?)7) The learning curve is incredibly steep: dental school does not teach dentists as much as they learn on the job (on their mistakes, i.e. YOU).8) Dentists are basically different people when among peers. (Like other service-oriented professionals I guess). Not bad people! In many ways way better than I expected. More personable, more intelligent (just look at their signatures at forums!), more authentic, funnier, way more modest and less full of themselves. Way different though.More than ever, the dental profession (probably, medical in general) now reminds me of a medieval guild, from which it originates.=======I started looking at all that, because I don't know where to even begin finding a good dentist; and now I know why. Patients on Yelp, droogle and such only care about superficial things, not longevity of dental work (they do care about cosmetics, fortunately, as do I, so there is that), so their testimonies are of limited use; can't ask a dentist because of a possible conflict of interest (referrals are a very serious business); also, it appears that a dentist often won't refer to his or her professor, because of the fear that the professor might see their mistakes. In my town where most dentists have graduated from the same local dental school and know each other, this social aspect might be quite significant.Now that I have this frightening awareness that dentists screw up just as much as we do, which is to say, a lot (I am a programmer), where do I find a dentist who will do a good job?"

LADentalclinic: Yes.  If the cavity is deep into the tooth and reaches the nerve just doing a filling will cause more harm than good.  Your child could begin to experience pain and swelling.  A root canal on a baby tooth is called a pulpotomy.  It is much simpler, quicker, and less expensive than a root canal on an adult tooth.  During a pulpotomy, the infected nerve and tissue inside of the tooth is removed.  The stainless steel cap protects the restored tooth from breaking.  If the tooth is removed instead, a space maintainer needs to be worn to leave room for the permanent tooth that will grow in later. Josh Willson: I agree with LaDental. May be best."

This gum now has an infection so I have been in complete agony for weeks now with this tooth.Only yesterday, a lower front tooth decides to play up, agony worse than the extraction pain.. I think possibly just travelling pain but I got seen today from a dentist and right enough, an abscess - needs root treated.. another one added to the long list of work to be done.I plan on having a chat with my dentist about what can be done long term because i can't do this.. it's upsetting, painful and getting too much to face every few weeks.What are my options at my age? I'm missing 5 teeth in total and the majority have had fillings or undergone or to be root treated. People keep telling me get my teeth done, just get them done... what does this even mean?what are my options?thank you. BilboSwaggins: Sounds like you need to go see a cosmetic dentist for some work. You should definitely take care of that abscess ASAP. If you wait, things will just get worse rather quickly. At this stage you should really get a professional consultation set up to find the best options for you. LADentalclinic: That must be so frustrating. You should definitely have a complete exam done and ask for a treatment plan.  This will outline all of the work that you need and give you a cost estimate.  There are many cosmetic treatments for improving the appearance of your teeth but you want to treat the infections first so you can get out of pain."

    "title": "Advice on avoiding abcesses since no dental insurance",
    "dialogue": "B K: I wanted to ask a dentist an advice question.My issue is I have periodontitis that is progressing (sensitive teeth and tooth/jaw pain, receding gumlines, etc) and probably as a result have many cavities. I can't get more than one or two cavities filled since my dental benefit on my insurance is only $500 per year (which gets eaten up every year by my yearly exam/x-rays and one or two fillings which there invariably is, every year).  I got peridontitis to start with since my dental was canceled on my insurance several years ago so plaque built up as I couldn't afford to go for my yearly exam and \"scrape\".Anyway, my question is: if I have more than a couple cavities the next time I go in, obviously I won't be able to get them filled so how do I avoid abcesses and other complications of that? I would like to get my periodontitis treated, but again, I could never afford it. Any tips??? LADentalclinic: Unfortunately when cavities aren't filled they continue to get larger and will eventually reach the pulp of the tooth.  Once this happens a root canal is necessary if the tooth is restorable.  Root canals can be expensive so it is much better to fix teeth when the decay is minor, even if you can only afford to fix one tooth at a time.  Treating your periodontal disease is also a very wise decision because it can adversely affect other areas of your body."

You can wear a partial denture to replace one or more teeth.  Some partials are metal based  while others have a pink resin base that is more flexible.  There are also temporary partials sometimes called flippers which are less expensive.  Implants are another very good way to replace missing teeth."

    "dialogue": "Mair Davies: I was eating a seeded bread roll yesterday and a very hard seed hit my back molar causing great pain.  I can't see any crack in the tooth but it is very painful to bite on.  The tooth is filled.  Will this go away in time? It does not ache all this time only when I bite I it. artofsmile: It may due to the decay around the edges of filling.As you get older, fillings can weaken and fracture or leak around the edges. It’s easy for bacteria to accumulate in these tiny crevices, which causes acid build-up and eroding of enamel.Immediately consult a dentist without any further delays. Ohio Dentistry: Ouch, sounds painful.  Are you sure that the seed is not lodged in there? I've had a few patients before have similar problems with things like raspberry and rye bread seeds, they get lodged in between teeth or near the gums and cause swelling and pain.  Even after the seed is removed, there can still be some tenderness and discomfort.  I do suggest seeing a dentist if the pain continues more than a couple days. David Smith: Receding gums can be caused by conditions such as gum disease, which can expose the tooth's dentine and cause sensitivity. Brushing too vigorously can also cause receding gums. danielhermann: Due to accumulation of cavities or tooth decaying the pain may have been there, it is better to get the problem rectified under the observation of a good dentist, So that following pain issue can be resolved well on time, else it may lead to other health issue DentistD: Don't brush too hard or more frequently than your dentist recommends, use softer tooth brush MarkSummers: I suggest you use desensitizing toothpaste. I love Organic Dentifrice toothpaste by Shaklee. The toothpaste is made of eggshells and water. Organic Dentifrice toothpaste is completely natural and won't harm your teeth. It doesn't have the harsh ingredients that many name brand toothpastes do... stevengoldy: I think minor cracks on teeth can not be easily visible itself,\nyou must visit experienced dentist to check it very clearly,\nthen may be if there is any minor crack it can be found and you can get better solution to overcome from it. LADentalclinic: Some tooth fractures can be very difficult to see.  You should visit a dentist who will take an x-ray and do a clinical exam.  You will then be given treatment options that can get you out of pain.  If your tooth is fractured, an inlay, onlay, or crown may be recommended."

Too much pressure on the remaining teeth. I'm hoping a dentist or prosthodontist can help you out here. If your bone level is good enough you might be a candidate for implants if you are able to afford that treatment. Good Luck. stevengoldy: you should visit a cosmetic dentist nearby you.\nand let him analyze your teeth for what exactly the direction for it.\nHe will guide you for the same. LADentalclinic: A cosmetic dentist is not what you need.  A general dentist can advise you based on x-rays and a clinical exam whether or not you have enough bone support around healthy teeth to support a partial.

I had a cracked tooth under a crown that had decayed pretty deeply (dentist missed the \"massive amount of decay\" shown on a one year old x-ray).  They removed my crown, cleaned up the perimeter, set a temporary crown with permanent cement and sent me to a specialist to get a root canal through the temporary crown.  Now I called in to get an appointment to get the permanent crown and was told that I needed to first come in to get a temporary crown and prep the tooth.  I understand needing to prep the tooth - but do I need to now start over and get the temporary cracked off and then another temporary put in place while I wait for the permanent crown?  My dentist is only in the office 2 days and the receptionist didn't seem to have a clue.  Does this sound right????  I am a acutely fearful patient and the whole process has traumatized me.  I don't understand having to go through another temporary crown process. LADentalclinic: If your 1st temporary crown was seated with permanent cement (very unusual) it will have to be cut off which would make a second temporary crown necessary.  Normally temporary crowns are cemented with temporary cement so it can be easily removed."

I have spent the last year with on and off pain in my 5th tooth upper level (again please excuse my lack of knowledge and stupidity here) now i realize that waiting in pain was a silly thing to do. Long story short a piece came off the tooth the other day so i finally got to the dentists. The Dentist told me that i needed a \"fibrepost and perma core comp building\" and the tooth wouldn't be suitable for a crown as the procedure would ruin the tooth. I have a feeling that he is trying to push me into treatments that are not available on the NHS (i am in the UK) which is fine if necessary. My question is if the majority of the tooth is still remaining is it true that a crown is not possible? Also with the treatment he has recommended should there be a crown placed on top anyway? I am having nightmares of paying hundreds of pounds for a treatment that looks nothing like a tooth. If this is the case i would rather pay more for an extraction and implant.Thanks in advance for your help guys thomas m mcconnell: In over 20 years of practice I have not come across a case  where the the majority of tooth remains and a crown is contra indicated. To be fair, an x-ray at the very least would be required by myself to form a more certain  opinion. nhred: thanks for your response Thomas, do you think that I should get a second opinion? thomas m mcconnell: Yes  you should get a second opinion .  Also let me edit my first response . Crowns are usually and most often placed on teeth that are mostly eaten up by decay , fractured,  have had a root canal and simply put have to little tooth structure left to retain a normal filling. From that view point I do not see how a tooth with the majority of tooth remaining would be ruined by a crown. There are in fact many instances when a crown would be considered over treatment. I have also learned that there are exceptions to many rules in Dentistry and with that in mind your Dentist may be right after all.  Finally,  if your tooth was restored with a buildup and does not expect a good prognosis as a  final restoration or is aesthetically and functionally not acceptable then a crown would very likely be a better treatment.......and \"possible\"."

I've had that filling in place for about 6 months and haven't had any issues with it. My dentist used amalgam since he said it was the most durable filling for molars (I also don't buy into the amalgam/mercury panic). I had a PFM crown on tooth 19 which needed to be replaced due to a gap between the crown and tooth (that crown was NOT done by my current dentist). I opted for a gold crown since it offers the best performance. The gold crown was placed two weeks ago.Since getting the gold crown I've started noticing the amalgam filling will sometimes have a metallic taste. This isn't something I've ever experienced before and have been pondering what it might be. So I was wondering, is it possible or even probable that there's a galvanic reaction occurring between the amalgam filling and the gold crown right next to it?"

I have been to specialists (periodontist) on gums and teeth,\nwhich have cleaned and basically said to continue my same dental habits of brushing several times\na day, and that eventually the gums would heal naturally.with this, since the pain has not resided, it occurs from each time i brush, i have\ntried over 20 different types of toothbrushes, everything from soft to medium ect..,\nalso have used about dozen types of toothpastes, mouth washes, gels and nothing\nseems to resolve the irritation.I have noticed the pain comes from brushing, when i brush too close to the teeth\ngum line, and in result, the burning sensation occurs, and in order to remove plaque\nwith excessive brushing became a little bit reddish and receding. I am aware the human body is designed to heal itself, and i am hopefully doing everything\nthat is required, from proper diet ( i am a vegetarian, but i am also taking the needed vitamins).\nmy other concerns are that since the bushing to remove the plaque buildup is important\nto keep up, so it won't lead to gingivitis and other gum/teeth diseases, i am in constant\nstress of trying to find the balance of keeping my teeth clean, and healthy, without\nthe gum irritation. I know stress, emotional worries, fears, don't help the healing process, and the longer\nthis continues, i do worry that it will become chronic pain, and will never heal.i would also like to mention about my gum irritation, that the pain is in specific area\nof the outer parts of several lateral teeth up and down (where I've been brushing energetically\nto whiten them), while frontal and back teeth have no irritation, and also there is no irritation\nin whole inner side of any teeth. And also, toothpastes such as Colgate and vademecum started to peel\nthe oral mucosa inside my mouth, while the mouthwashes such as Listerine and lacalut are giving me a\nburning sensation. I am here to ask for help, to seek and understand why this is happening, are the\nnerves in the gums just very sensitive right now for myself, and i need to be more careful\nwhen brushing, and also, how to keep the plaque buildup minimum while keeping my\nteeth clean and healthy, and having no gum pain. thank you\n-Lili consultant: maybe overbrushing might be irritating that spot. Lay off for a good week and see where you are then. danielhermann: I too agree with the above saying that over brushing your teeths may be responsible for creation of  pain in gums or in the spot which is already in pain. Try to minimize your brushing habit to twice a day, which will also help you to retain your shine & healthy teeth & gums. MarkSummers: Whether you are having gum pain or nerve pain . but still, if its gum pain, it can be due to gingivitis or periodontitis or if their is infected tooth with a draining sinus, it can also cause pain in gums. stevengoldy: Daily brushing is the best way to keep healthy your teeth for beautiful smile on your face,\nbut excess and over brushing will be affect badly on your teeth."

Today ( Monday) I called my dentist's office because I needed to cancel an appointment I had for Wednesday to extract 2 teeth that are broken. I had to cancel since we are a one income family and my car decided to completely break down on us this weekend and we have to buy a new used car. In our budget, we just don't have the money to spend thousands of dollars on the implants I need and also get a car. I thought I had a good relationship with my dentist and his staff as my whole family has gone to them for a couple of years now and we have never had issues with them. Anyway, when I called first thing this morning and cancelled my appointment, I was thoroughly chewed out by the staff member who answered the phone and was chastised for having to cancel my appointment to get this work done on several other occasions. I was absolutely shocked and appalled as I have a severe medical condition that they are fully aware of and I have had to cancel appointments before because I was having surgeries and had my medical condition flare up. I know that their behavior is completely unprofessional and I understand if they are frustrated because I have had to cancel my appointments to get the work done, but I have always cancelled several days to weeks in advance when I have had an issue arise and think that the way they handled it is completely uncalled for. I forgot to mention that back in December I had taken in my son for an appointment and at the time I was very sick with the flu and they saw me suffering. I had an appointment set for later that same week and had talked to the receptionist about cancelling it. She told me to wait until the day before to see if maybe I would get better. When I came home, there was a nasty email from the dentist saying that they know I am sick and have other medical conditions, but they need to know immediately if I can make my appointment. I called back and cancelled and felt embarrassed to get such a nasty email. Now this happens. I really don't want to go back because of the way I was treated and I want to find a different dentist. I guess what I am asking is if anyone else has had this type of thing happen to them and is this something to report them on.

It is worth putting a little money into having a professional website made if you currently do not have a website.SEO\nThere are things you can do on your website, (on site SEO), and things that you can do off your website that will help your site appear in a decent spot in search results. On site SEO includes things like keywords or phrases used in your textcopy, high quality content, internal links,... Off site SEO includes things like links on other peoples sites, Twitter posts and mentions, press releases, article submissions, paid advertising,... A lot of which you can do yourself, have a staff member do, or hire someone. Be careful when hiring a SEO person or business because there are a lot of snake oil salesmen in the SEO world. Google AdWords\nTrial and error. You can set a budget as to the max you want to spend. There is a lot of information from Google and misc places that can help you choose what is right for you. Facebook\nFacebook is a way to get noticed and potential new patients. Create a Facebook page for the office and use it to network with other dentists, assistants and hygienists, and patients. You can also buy Facebook ads that are GEO targeted. You set a budget and have to pay each time someone clicks on your ad. There's a lot of information on the Facebook help pages and there are ways to also use Facebook for free exposure.YP - Yellow Pages online or Yahoo Places?Blog\nYou can have a blog for your business that updates patients on what is going on in the dental practice as well as provide practical information and tips. How to get your child to brush and floss their teeth? Is whitening your teeth right for you? How to properly care for partials and dentures? Which over-the-counter whitening products are okay to use? Talk about any specials or discounts you might offer. The ins and out of dental insurance. Talk about any new procedures or products you use and why. You can have guest bloggers who write dental articles for your blog. You can pay to have dental articles written or purchase articles from an article source. You can also use the blog to help boost your website ranking as part of your overall SEO strategy. It's not like you only have to choose one or two online marketing options to invest your money in. Some things you can do yourself or spend a small amount of money on. You can go the route of hiring a marketing specialist, just do your homework before hiring one because some people and/or businesses will promise a whole lot or they realise this isn't your strong point and will use it to their advantage.Just remember that advertising online is not just about placing a link or making a website go live on the web and you are going to be flooded with new patients by the end of the week. DentalHealthBlog.com\nAn educational blog about all things dentistry related, written in an easy to understand way. Douglas: Networking with your online communityYou also need to think about contacting your local online community for referrals and links. This will help you to increase your online profile.This is not a case of just posting links on forums, rather it is building up a reputation where people want to link to your valid content.Forums and message boards however are a good place to start. If you become a trusted member in answering questions you can often leave your website link in your signature.There are also companies that will perform this service for you and call it 'link building'. Be warned though, some of them employ underhanded tactics to gain links.Kind regards,Care Dental Rodrick Etienne: Hello Daniel,First off, I applaud you for starting your own dental practice, because we all know that starting and running a business can be tough work, otherwise everyone would do it.Congrats on that!I understand that the world of marketing can be very overwhelming with all the new marketing strategies, new platforms, software, services and the list goes on...One person says this is the way to go and the other totally contradicts it.Trust me, I understand where you're coming from.Here's the good news...I'm not confused and I know what works when it comes to bringing in more patients into your practice...Not to sound cocky or anything.Trust me, it's taken me a great deal of effort in time, money (lots of it), and effort to weed out all the Internet Marketing hype.I've written several no-fluff, no-hype articles that addresses your question on my blogs and other website properties, but I'll elaborate a little on what's working right here in this post as I don't want to write a book (LOL).Marketing Strategy #1: Reputation MarketingWith the recent Trends that have been taking place during the last 12 plus months where SEO, Social Media, and Reputation have now been combined, you definitely must put your efforts here.If you go to your Google+ Page, you'll notice that It includes Reviews, Reputation Monitoring (must be logged in), and the ability to interact with your patients (that's the Social Media element).The SEO element comes into play because it's also your local Google Map listing that appears (if properly optimized) when a potential patient searches for dental services in your city or town.Google has now put Reviews above every other marketing element.If you have bad reviews your potential patients will see them and you'll lose thousands of dollars because of them...A potential patient that sees negative reviews posted about your practice on your Google+ Page will most likely call your competitor whom have good reviews.No Reviews can be just as bad, because with no reviews a potential patient doesn't have anything to base their decision on.Once you have several 5-star reviews, you must market those all over the Internet for your potential patients to see them, which of course will motivate them to call you because they'll see you as the market leader.Marketing Strategy #2: Google Plus (a.k.a Google Maps Listing)You must make sure you claim your Google Plus page because it's the single best Patient Generator that you can have Online and the best part is that Google provides it for FREE.It's already Mobile-Friendly.Google has made your Google Plus page soo important, that it shows up above the organic Search Engine listings...The only listings that appear about the Google+ Pages are listings that appear in the Top Local Business Directories such as Yelp, Kuduz, and so on.The dentist Google Plus pages that appear on page one for the best keywords (i.e. cosmetic dentists) will get all the potential patients calling them.Here's the thing, there's only 7 spots that Google will show on the first page (A through G), and if you're not there, you're missing out on all that Internet Traffic.While I can get into several other Marketing Strategies that work, just know those two are the absolute most important.With that said...Reputation Marketing has to be the first element that you work on, because what good will it do you to Rank your Website/Blog and even your Google Plus page if you have either Negative or No Reviews?I don't want to spam this forum because I'm truly here to help dentists that have marketing related questions, but if you want to know more about Reputation Marketing and Google Plus, just visit my site at http://www.strategictwistmarketing.com danielhermann: Hey Daniel it is true that Dentist do advertise their work nowadays a lot, but advertising i think you first need to establish yourself as a good nearby dentist, who is smart in handling any issues occurring due to bad oral health. Once the pillars of foundation are made, then you can easily think of taking another plunge in advertising yourself via social media. MarkSummers: Hello Daniel.. I do agree to most of the suggestions written on this thread. Sometime when we do have too many options we find it more difficult to choose. Better yet establish your business first and a little bit of online work can help. Some can even be done on your own if you have the time for it."

    "dialogue": "ricj7: I had a side low jaw tooth extracted 12 days ago. It had one root and it all went fine. Doctor had used anesthesia well and there was no pain during or immediate after extraction. Btw, my age is 45 years.However, now 12 days have passed but where the needle was used i.e. back of the mouth where both upper and lower jaws meet......that area the anesthesia was injected. After 12 days, I am having problems opening the mouth fully i.e. normally and it pains to do so. It is as if some lock has been placed on the back of the jaw. This pain was there from day 1 but I am surprised that it has not gone away by now.Also, the socket area of extraction, when I press on gums around etc. I can feel the pain. Same during eating if some hard item hits the socket where the tooth was pulled out from.The dentist who performed this surgery is now far as I did it during the travel to Florida. I need to know a) how long does it take to heal the socket area fully. b) the pain on the area where two jaws meet i.e. back of the mouth, when will it go away and when I will be able to open mouth fully. Even some jerk type action like throwing a ball hard or nodding head, i can feel that jaw pain and it worries me.I hope I have not caught any infection. Have had extractions before but never took so long for healing. Please advise if I need to go to a dentist or it is just normal going after extraction. Thanks all !!"

    "dialogue": "crossbone: I'm planning to have my teeth cleaned and since I have stains, some extensive work is needed. In light of that, is it ok to have a teeth whitening procedure performed on the same day? CraigRWS: In this instance I'd probably wait a good few days after the cleaning before using any whitening products. If you don't you may find the whitening product will make your teeth/gums quite sensitive. Jennifer Shaw: Cleaning before whitening is a good idea, to remove all the plaque, tartar and some debris and to have great result for your teeth whitening. I'll also agree with Craig, some patients may may have possible sensitivity when having a cleaning, so you might have your teeth whitening treatment within a week of your cleaning. danielhermann: Yes teeth cleaning is important to get rid of cavities or stains which causes many dental issues, but cleaning & whitening shouldn't be taken place at the same time rather whitening should be done once healing takes place after moth cleaning. MarkSummers: Having a cleaning with your hygienist before whitening is definitely a good idea. The plaque, tarter, and/or debris will cause a build-up on your teeth that may not allow the teeth to whiten in certain areas, resulting in uneven coloring on your teeth. The same is true for the inflamation of the gums. If the whitening is done when your gums are inflamed you may have left over yellowing close to the gums after the inflimation is taken care of... MarkSummers: Cleaning and whitening your teeth shouldn't be done in just a day as they will become sensitive. And it will have the possibility that it couldn't be done correctly."

    "dialogue": "mabwriter: I had a filling that fell out so I went to the dentist today to get it refilled expecting to hear I'd need a root canal. Well the dentist said there was no abscess and based on x-rays I wouldn't need a root canal, however said that could change once they drill and see how much decay there is, but in cases like mine it's very rare.Well I expected to have it filled today, but instead they scheduled it for next week. Is it normal? Couldn't it get worse where I'd need a root canal?Also, I am not feeling any root canal symptoms, but ever since the hygienist blew that cold air into the hole where my filling was, my tooth has a slight ache. I'm guessing having cold air blown into a hole in your tooth is going to cause sensitivity, but just want to check. Cin: If you don't have pain, first of all you wouldn't need a root canal.  It would just cause sensitivity because it was an open hole. Libra: if RCT is not advised and there is no pain , then its ok to delay your appointment of filling for a week. MarkSummers: I've had fillings refilled, taken out and refilled again. Never a root canal because the root was healthy and showed no signs of decay.Its always good to Get a second opinion from another dentist. danielhermann: Yes i too believe that you need a second opinion to further reflect as what is hurting teeth or gums. Also cleanse your mouth with a mouthwash after every brushing, but try not to hurt that effected area. MarkSummers: I have fillings also and the dentist had full this off once due to some cases.

I had an upper wisdom tooth removed and during the process it appears the dentist chipped the adjacent molar in several places on one side of the molar.He didn't say anything to me during the procedure and after it was over I asked if everything looked good to which he answered \"yes\". So I'm a bit upset he didn't tell me what went wrong and I am concerned that having this chipped molar can lead to problems down the road. I am not sure how this would be repaired as I have never had this happen before.I am hoping I can get some advice. I am going to contact the dentist but I am unsure If I can get him to repair the damage or if I should even be concerned. I am assuming having the enamel broken off the tooth in a few places can't be good at all.thanks for reading and any responses. BilboSwaggins: That's horrible. I can't believe he didn't even tell you. You need to tell him asap. That's just wrong. Research cosmetic dentistry stuff. I personally think a crown would be your best bet, but it just sucks to have to do that because it isn't ever going to be the same as your original tooth.

    "title": "kind of hurts to brush teeth after 2-3 days of alcohol consumption",
    "dialogue": "gkitty: I literally for 2 days mixed up some (1 bottle of vodka for all 2-3 days) and some walmart brand Pink lemonade \"crystal light\" The stuff itself has no sugar in it.Anyhow I woke up a day or so ago and brushed my teeth and noticed it didn't really hurt to brush but it would zing me around my gum lines and the crowns of my teeth. This is not just occurring in one place of my mouth but all over. it's easier to make contact with the zing around the front and back of the gum line . I've never had this problem before and i brush and floss regularly. I read it could be gum recession? Is this anything I should worry about? Is this possible to happen to someone over a 2-3 day period? Will From Hull: Drinking vodka for two days isn't going to be good for your teeth. For a start - it contains potato - which is high in starch (which is converted to sugar easily). Alcohol is also 'converted' sugar.\nSo all in all, you have given your teeth a battering for 3 days. I'd drink nothing but water and milk for a few days, and use mouthwash after brushing in an evening. ThirdStreetDental: Gum recession is very unlikely to occur after only a 2-3 day period. However, you could have sensitive teeth. While the Crystal Light doesn't have sugar in it, alcohol does, which can lead to cavities and further irritate sensitive teeth. I would switch to a toothpaste for sensitive teeth, such as Sensodyne, and if the problem continues see your dentist. You could also be brushing too hard. Ohio Dentistry: I agree with ThirdStreetDental above, try using Sensodyne or other like toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  I really think that the massive amount of crystal light may have caused the sensitivity.  True it may not have sugar in it, but it probably has some kind of artificial sweetener, or like chemical (otherwise you'd just be drinking sour lemon water).  I've had a similar sensitivity happen to me.  I was traveling for a weekend and drank a few bottles of Poweraid/Gatoraid over the couple days with very little water.  The Poweraid made my teeth sensitive, but no permanent damage.  I believe it had to do with the \"fake sugar\" they put in those kinds of sport drinks. consultant: Many adults have gum recession later in life. That's not uncommon. Try drink in moderation and less frequently. You'll enjoy it more that way. If you can't do that then you need to start going to AA. Don't brush for a few days. Then touch and see if it's tender still. If it is wait another week before attempting to brush. and lay off the boze danielhermann: Any starch based drinks does harms our teeth like anything if the same has been consumed for 2-3 days, though in your case it seems that too much consumption of liquor has made your teeth much sensitive, that is why consumption of liquor is always held as bad for tooth or gums."

My wife or myself catch me doing it occassionally, as I do it subconsciously, but I don't do so often anymore. Anyway, I had a big shock a week ago when I noticed I have chipped a back tooth, the bottom left and second from last (the cusp I think you call it). I didn't feel it happen and only noticed because I felt a jagged point with my tongue. I only ever felt an uncomfortable feeling 4 days later after playing around with it too much with my tongue and started to feel the \"nerve\" running down my chaw but that went away after around 12 hours. Now it feels normal again even when eating or drinking hot or cold liquids.After doing some research I have learned that teeth can crack and chip over time and it has frightened me about my previous anxiety habit that probably lasted for around 4 years!! However, the tooth in question that cracked had an enormous filling that I remember the dentist almost wanted to pull out 10 years ago (It took me a long time to go to the dentist because I thought my pain was due to a gum problem as I couldn't feel any pain on my tooth,  only the gum and was gargling down listeren all day, still should've gone though). One question I have is could my past habit have caused fractures or kill nerves? I am going to the dentist to check the chipped tooth but what would you expect him to do? Can I check for fractures in my teeth?  As I have already stated I have anxiety so am concerned about my teeth  . dentistinnoida: Yes, definitely. your past habit may weaken your teeth. It may also cause 'Attrition' which initially starts with hot and cold sensations. You must visit your dentist ASAP. Unfortunately, there is not way to stop such habits but consciously trying to avoid doing them. marrkarnell: i also had a chipped tooth in the past. i thought it's just something that stuck on my tooth. after a while, i was able to get the chipped part. and after few months, i have to go to dentist because the chipped tooth is aching. there i discovered that i had tooth cavity. just sharing! )))) Cin: What is chaw? danielhermann: My friend i believe it is important to get your problem sorted out as soon as possible, since any problem leads to many other unseen on mouth issues, It is due to your past habit, which has given rise too many tooth issues.

He also said if it came loose and was damaged or lost he would replace at his cost.My concern at this point is, do I need to worry about bacteria getting under the unsealed crown and causing decay/infection?

Jennifer Shaw: That is quite strange. Yes, you should insist your dentist to apply cement to the inside of the crown surface and then fit it into place over the tooth.Probably because of the number of processing steps on the installation, the dentist did a slight discrepancy on the fitting. So make him do a minor grinding and smoothing of its surface to ensure it fits correctly. SacredGal: wow I would totally insist on him cementing it and I would not leave until he does so SacredGal: oh wow and no way would I have let an assistant do any fit and finish , I don't care how much experience she has , with my dentist I made this very clear when I started to see him , that the assistant was to only assist him and do nothing on me"

I guess it began some time ago, but it has not been bothering me until now.\nI've had some \"dental injuries\" in the past, which required some minor reconstructions of the upper front teeth ( crown reconstruction ). Since then the gums are permanently swollen. I've visited two dentists but none of them could really help me. The first one thought it may be related to the irritation caused by irregular, sharp surface of the composite, which was corrected afterwards. The problem persisted. Another came up with an idea of overgrowth caused by the lack of contact between the teeth.. He fixed it, swelling decreased a bit, but it's still there.\nIt sometimes hurts during flossing, sometimes not. It's sensitive to touch, mostly near the teeth, at the edge. It's not that significantly reddish, but the difference is noticeable.\nI think i should also mention that the surfaces of those teeth are not even ( due to the reconstruction ), which makes me wonder if this may be the cause ( pressure ). I also am more of a mouth breather myself, which also may be a direct factor. Thus i was wondering if there are any things that i could cover swollen gums with during sleep, to prevent the irritation.\nI brush, floss, rinse and visit my dentist regularly, so i think it's highly unlikely that my oral hygiene is the problem.\nI would be really grateful if you could share some suggestions with me, but on the other hand i am aware, that it may be difficult to identify the underlying cause.\nThanks in advance consultant: don't brush, floss, or rinse for at least a week and see how it feels. I suspect its constantly being irritated by over cleaning."

I went to the dentist and she filled out, but the toothache persisted. We decided to try root treatment, however when she started it my nerves wouldn't go numb. She gave me antibiotics and I was supposed to go back, but after the pain I experienced I was too terrified. I left it a few months and had a few niggles but nothing I couldn't manage with painkillers.Than a few weeks ago the pain changed. Instead of being normal toothache, it was sore when I bit down or put pressure on my tooth, and I could feel swelling on the gum beside the tooth. I decided to go to a different dentist, who gave me antibiotics. After taking them, the swelling was still there but she started the root treatment anyway. It was going ok and she managed to get some of the nerve out but there was one that was still too painful. She dressed it and said it should die off and to come back the following week to finish off. However the pain had worsened and the swelling was getting worse, so I went back a few days early and asked to have it removed. She extracted the tooth this morning, which was fine, but now the anaesthetic has worn off the tooth beside the extracted tooth is now painful in the same way ie when i bite down or put pressure on. Does anyone have any idea what is going on?? I'm at my wits end"

There is zero sensitivity and its great for on the Go or Home use at budges costs in comparison to Office brightening treatments. Definitely worth a try.

I have heard that a lot of people have benefited from it and am planning to getting it done. Do it have any side effects? jpalmer: I know whiter image works well. But the pen is just used as a touch up. You will need to use some trays that keep it on your teeth longer to get better results. Just make sure you get a gum exam to make sure you do not have periodontal disease before using the trays otherwise you could have more pain and sensitivity than necessary. Whiter image makes a take home tray kit that is very reasonably priced. CraigRWS: Terryguy said:\t\t\tHello everyone. I am trying to get my teeth whiter while staying on my budget.

The yellowing could be due to drinks, such as soda and coffee and poor oral hygiene. You can't underestimate the importance of brushing and flossing. Plus, once plaque hardens only a dentist can remove it, which means you might have a build-up and that can create a yellow tint. You are still extremely young and can likely reverse any damage you've done. See a dentist as soon as you can. It's never as scary as you think it will be. As a dentist, I see terrified patients all of the time who think that their visit will be horrible because they haven't kept up with their regular dental check-ups. It's never as bad as you build it up to be. I promise! DentalDirectSales: I would start caring for them, go to the dentist and get them to clean them for you. Don't stress so hard, everyone makes mistakes. It's all about how you go about avoiding them in the future, and fixing the ones from the past. Start brushing your teeth twice a day, morning and night, and go see your local dentist ASAP so he can tell you more as to what's causing your pain! DentalSave: maintain your teethI completely agree, you have to seek professional dental care immediately! Keep in mind that neglecting the daily maintenance of your teeth can result in a dental bill worth several thousands.. biodentlaboratory: is dental insurance a problem? why wouldn't you go to the dentist? whatever it is you need to get over it and go! CraigRWS: As some one who went through a similar experience, I can only urge you to make the decision to see the dentist as soon as possible. The longer you leave it the worse it's going to get, and more expensive it will become. In the meantime buy a toothbrush and sensitive toothpaste and some floss. It's really does only take 2 - 3 minutes a couple of times a day at least. You can find instructional videos on youtube if you need to learn how to do it properly. It doesn't have to get any worse, just build up the courage and take the first step.. DentalDirectSales: Not keeping your mouth healthy and clean can result in a lot of other issues later down the road. Your best bet is to go see your dentist, get cleaned up, and listen to EVERY bit of advice he gives you. David Smith: Brush and Floss is very basic to improve your dental health.Plaque will build up and decay will be working overtime under it, get into the habit at least once a day."

I was just hoping to get a pretty good idea of what I'm dealing with here.  Thanks! GeekoSuave: Okay, after a bit of Googling, it seems like this could possibly mandibular torus, or torus mandibularis (not terrific with medical terms.)There are a couple things that tell me that this shouldn't be what it is, but obviously I wouldn't be here if I had even the slightest idea what it is.  It seems 90% of mandibular torus cases are bilateral, whereas mine is only on one side.  There are no other growths.  It also says this is a condition mostly prevalent in Asian men.  I'm a white male, 26 years old.  I read that grinding and clenching are possibly part of the problem if it is mandibular torus.  I do clench my teeth quite a bit, nearly subconsciously.  I don't even realize I'm doing it, but then at the end of the day I find that my jaw and teeth are sore from how much I've been doing it throughout the day.  Hope this helps.

I get something of the same when i have too much citrus and clench a lot too. I also grind the heck out of my teeth. It can sometimes take two weeks for mine to go away.  If you've had it for 4 yrs., it's definitely worth getting checked out- it can only help you! You could probably benefit in some stress relieving activities as well!

Nealy 4 months back a mustard seed got stuck in that gap, despite rinsing and picking I couldn't get it out. While it was stuck there whenever I chewed or bit I used to feel pain there. Somehow it got out in one of my brushing but I still used to feel pain. I visited few dentists and they said the 3rd molar needs to be extracted and root canal needs to be done on 2nd molar. One of the dentist put a cotton bud there but it used to get softened and dislodged and come of it's place. Another dentist said that I should have removed it as it is a foreign particle and shouldn't have left it there. Earlier dentist put 2 cotton buds there, 1 in the cavity and another on top of it, I think the lower one was pressing on the 2nd molar and causing a lot of pain. Today I somehow got it removed after a lot of effort and I'm not feeling that much pain on 2nd molar when I'm pressing down on it. There is still pain but not as much as I felt before. Can the hole left by extraction be closed or sealed? Is there any alternate treatment other than root canal?

I'll be using layman's terms here because I have zero expertize in the dental field.\nI will outline my dental issues using the standard adult dental layout (which I researched online)  All the work I need done is on the “Top” row of teeth. Positions #1-16 top right to left. The dental office is promoting a “Credit plan” which I feel influences the patient's (me) decision process and promote a “Do it all” strategy would be best. I REALLY don't want to start another line of credit right now but I am wondering if I have choices? Professionally speaking, would it be okay to have these procedures done one step at a time? And if so where should I start?

ThirdStreetDental: I don't see why you couldn't have the procedures done over a period of time. If you are really adverse to starting another line of credit, this is really your only option. Shop around and compare prices. It's better to have it done slowly than not at all. While it's ideal to fix any many of the problems as possible in a timely manner, you will still get the benefits of taking care of your teeth. The only issue that sticks out to me as an urgent matter is the missing tooth. Not replacing the tooth leads to bone loss and the other teeth shift, which can cause further tooth loss. My practice offers dental implants in North Vancouver. This is an excellent, more permanent solution to bridges or dentures. It will actually stimulate bone growth and you'll have a new tooth that functions and looks like the rest of your teeth. It can truly save your dental health. The filling should be second in your plan, as cavities can get worse if left untreated. Maxwell Not so smart: Thank you so much for taking the time to help me. I appreciate your input. DentalDirectSales: Like Third said, Over time is better than never going at all. If you're worried about your teeth moving around at all, or ever to stop the moving that has already started, I would have them check the missing tooth out first!"

I've had pains every time I opened my mouth for the past few months, but last night before I went to bed, I put a massager (vibrator for muscles) under my pillow and rested my head on it, after about 5 mins I started tasting blood, sat up and spit out a little blood that was mixed with a little brown stuff and surprisingly I could open my mouth with no pains!  I'm just wondering if anyone could explain why that cured my mouth pain."

    "dialogue": "Ms. V: My front tooth was knocked out when I was a youngster. Last year, my cap (or whatever it's called) fell out and I went to the dentist. She diagnosed gum disease and said she would not put in a partial unless I received extensive cleaning treatments first. I need my partial as I work with the public. She has refused to give me a partial stating she would be liable if she didn't treat my gum disease first. Can she refuse to give me my partial? I think she feels I won't be back for the treatments. Can she do this? ThirdStreetDental: Yes. A dentist can refuse to perform a treatment if it is not safe. I'd advise you to get a second opinion, however, it will likely be the same outcome. Addressing your gum disease is the number one priority. I know it can be tough when you are out in the public, but in the long run your teeth and gums will be much healthier. Go for the treatments and take care of it sooner rather than later."

If it stains your teeth, this can be reduced by avoiding tea, coffee and wine, and brushing teeth with a normal toothpaste before using this medicine. If you wear dentures clean them with a denture cleanser before using this medicine Will From Hull: My Auntie has used it for years and never mentioned about it staining her teeth.Although maybe she never knew!  However, my girlfriend's sister (who is a dental hygienist) said that it does indeed stain. I used it recently, but only for 2 weeks - as per my girlfriend's sister's advice.\nMarrkarnell mentioned that staining can be reduced by avoiding tea, coffee and wine. However, that - to me - states the obvious. Everyone knows that tea, coffee and wine staines the teeth!\nCorsodyl should only be used to treat gum problems and not as a regular mouth wash.

Can anyone tell me if they can dump me as a patient for being pregnant or are they obliged to see me. there are no NHS dentist in my area.any help would be great!thank you Sheila john dentist: Hi Megan\nI am a dentist working in Liverpool. How I understand it is if you are already registered as an NHS patient then you automatically become exempt for the duration of your pregnancy and for 12 months after you've had your baby. However if you are not already registered under the NHS but are currently being treated as a private patient then no the practice has no obligation to transfer you to free NHS treatment. You can either find an alternative NHS practice and register as a new patient or continue as a private non exempt patient. Hope this helps.\nOh and best of luck in your pregnancy-I am also blessed to be expecting myself! Will From Hull: Hi Megan,No - they are a private business. They can therefore accept and/or refuse custom to anybody according to their private policy.\nIt sounds unfair, but I was with a private practice for years.

That's fine, however, I am in a bit of a strange situation. I set up an appointment to see a dentist for a cleaning next week; however, I will be moving to Europe in 1 month from now. So I will soon be putting in my 2 week notice at work within the next week. So if I go to the dentist two weeks before I stop working for my current employer (who pays for dental insurance), will the cost still be covered by my insurance company? I just don't want the company to pull a fast one on me. So, essentially, if I go to the dentist while still employed by my current company, the insurance company will pay for the procedure? No prorations will occur, correct? I would assume this type of practice is regulated, but I do not trust the system. Thanks! Will From Hull: Work is liable I believe.

The dentist did another xray on that tooth and there is a dark shadow under the tooth where it meets the gumline.  She said it could be an irritation of the 'medicine' they put into the pulpotomy leaking out or it could be an infection and there is no way of telling unless we yank the tooth.

Big chunks of black sand-like pieces of my tooth where extracted from inside out. He also urged me to find out what substances the former doctor combined.The former doctor did admit to use all of the above, although I'm absolutely sure that he mixed them with some liquid that he does not want to disclose, and thus the chemical reaction and the production of what I guess to be something acid.If anyone knows what substance may have made the mix go black, please let me know.\nAlso any solution to what is now a porous black shell of a tooth (maybe something that can restore the tooth density a little). As I cannot have implants due to a genetic autoimmune disease, it is very important to me to keep the tooth as long as possible.Many thanks, \nM danielhermann: This problem is known as Discoloration.The red blood fills all the tubules in the Dentine which is the internal tooth structure.The blood then clots and turns dark which is the color you are seeing.The only way to reduce the color is to do an internal bleaching. porcelain veneer may be used to mask the discoloration protect the tooth.

So the impression for the new crown was taken before the root canal.  Will the root canal mean that the new crown that was ordered will not fit now and a new impression has to be taken?2) Couldn' t the general dentist have prevented the root canal? Can't they see where the nerves are from the x-ray?  Is there a chance that the root canal was caused by too aggressive drilling? DanPotter: I have a similar issue. My general dentist's hygienist discovered a deep cavity in a lower, lateral incisor (something the dentist himself should have noticed in his initial exam of my teeth). The cavity wasn't readily noticeable, I guess, because it was between two teeth.Anyway, he filled the cavity a few weeks ago and then the tooth started becoming sensitive to pressure/touch. Had a root canal done on it yesterday and the endodontist suspected the nerve was dead because the tooth didn't respond to cold.So I'm thinking...Why the heck didn't my general dentist figure that out before charging me $500 to fill that cavity (and an additional minor cavity in the adjacent cuspid)? mitzim440: I think there will be no need to put crown on the root canals. jpalmer: Dentists don't usually cause the need for abscessed teeth needing root canals. Sometimes when working on teeth, issues get exposed that were not before detectable. Abscesses occur because of infections, infections are acute, with pain, or chronic without paint. Chronic infections can become acute without warning or notice or not ever.You do not have to crown teeth with root canals, if you want to expose the now dead tooth that will become brittle to breaking more easily just leave it. If you want to protect the investment from the root canal then crown it. But, if you are not going to crown the tooth, you should save the money and just get it extracted now as that is what will eventually happen and you will have saved the money for the root canal. Just my opinion, no one has a crystal ball, playing the odds."

    "title": "A guide to Bruxism",
    "dialogue": "rosiebruce: There are two important issues about grinding your teeth that you should be aware of. First of all, it can cause your teeth real damage in the long term. In fact, in particularly extreme cases, it can cause damage to your teeth very quickly. The second issue about teeth grinding is that it can make life a misery – not for the grinder necessarily, but certainly for the poor person who is trying to sleep next to them.Medical experts believe that around 20% of people grind their teeth while they sleep. The medical name for it is bruxism. The reason why bruxism causes so much interest amongst the medical community is because it cannot be cured. Also, no-one really knows quite why some of us do grind our teeth. Some evidence suggests it is genetic. Other evidence suggests that it could be related to stress or anxiety. But because we don’t really know what causes it, we don’t really know how to cure it.So how do you know if you have a case of bruxism? Normally, the sufferer sleeps through it and it is usually the person next to them who notices it first. As you would imagine, sleeping next to someone who is grinding their teeth all night is very difficult! However, the sufferer themselves may begin to notice some side-effects of their bruxism. They may wake up in the morning with aching teeth or a saw jaw, for example.Bruxism is unusual in that it is both a medical problem and a dental problem. Therefore, if you are grinding your teeth on a regular basis, your first step should be to visit your GP. They will diagnose your condition in more detail to try and discover the extent of the problem. Don’t worry, they won’t have to attach sleep monitors. Usually, the diagnosis will involve making assumptions based on how you answer a number of questions. For example, do you wake up in the morning with headaches? If so, how severe are they – are they disrupting your everyday life? Other aches and pains, such as earache or a clicking jaw, can also be tell-tale signs that you are grinding your teeth at night.Based on your answers to these questions, your GP will usually be able to evaluate how serious the bruxism is. Mild cases of bruxism may not require any treatment, though your GP may encourage you to look at your lifestyle and diet to see if you can make any adjustments. It could be that you could look at ways to relieve some of the stress in your professional or personal life, which may help. Alternatively, it could be something like giving up smoking or drinking caffeine which makes the difference.If your GP believes you have a chronic case of bruxism which is seriously affecting your health or your partner’s quality of life, there are a number of treatment options at their disposal. As already mentioned, bruxism cannot be cured, so the treatment is usually based around finding ways to manage and reduce it, so that it does not continue to affect your quality of life.Treatment for bruxism normally combines two different strategies. There is the dental aspect, which could involve being fitted for a dental guard or splint which protects the teeth against the nightly wear and tear caused by bruxism. This will involve a visit to your dentist so that you can be fitted for a suitable product. Of course, this will not help to cure your condition; it will simply ensure that the damage to your teeth is minimised in the long term.The second part of the treatment normally involves exploring a variety of techniques to remove stress and anxiety and to improve relaxation before bedtime. It could include massage, for example, or working with a dietician to understand what you are eating before you go to bed. Some sufferers claim that behavioural therapies can help, such as autosuggestion techniques or hypnosis.Although there is a shortage of research into bruxism, there is some evidence to suggest that it primarily occurs in the lighter stages of sleep. Therefore, much of your treatment should be focused around ensuring that you are going to bed relaxed and ready to sleep, so that you enter a deep sleep as quickly as possible. In the same way that thinking about you evening diet can help, some sufferers have found that exercise can reduce their teeth grinding. danielhermann: Thanks for sharing this information rosiebruce.\nGrinding and clenching teeth is one of the common problem in dentistry. There are treatments for this as you discussed. The main cause of bruxism is stress. smiles4less: Bruxism is the medical term that describes the act of Teeth Grinding & Jaw Clenching, sometimes people grind their teeth without it causing any symptoms or problems. However, regular and persistent teeth grinding can cause pain and discomfort in your jaw and it can wear down your teeth.At smiles4less.co.uk we have a range of products designed specifically to combat the effects of bruxism. dentistinnoida: BruxismWhen you chew your food, your deliver a force of about 175 pounds per square inch (psi) to your teeth. But when you grind your teeth at night, there’s no food to absorb the impact, so the force on your teeth can be 300 psi or more. That’s enough to cause permanent damage to your teeth, including cracked and chipped enamel, hairline fractures, and even wearing down of the teeth to the gumline & loosening of the dental implant screws The enamel may become so worn that the inside of the tooth (called the dentin) is exposed. If bruxism isn’t treated, it can lead to gum damage, loss of both natural teeth and restorations, and other more complicated jaw-related disorders (such as TMJ known disorders). Over time, your teeth may become sensitive due to exposed dentin, and your jaws may even move out of proper balance. Grinding your teeth can also cause a wide variety of other symptoms including soreness and fatigue in your jaw and facial muscles, and earaches or headaches-especially when you wake up in the morning. There is no known cure for bruxism. Fortunately, with night-guard trays there are ways to reduce or stop your grinding and even ways to limit further damage and pain due to grinding.\nDo You Grind Your Teeth?\nHow to find out if you’re grinding your teeth?\nBecause most bruxism happens at night, most sufferers aren’t even aware of it until a sleep partner mentions the noise or until a dentist notices that their teeth are damaged. Here are some typical symptoms that may indicate nighttime teeth grinding:Symptom checklist:    Jaw or facial pain and tenderness on awakening that lessens throughout the day\n    Headaches or earaches in the morning that go away as the day wears on\n    Spouse or sleep partner complains that the noise is keeping them awake at night\n    Teeth have become sensitive to cold, pressure, or other stimuli\n    Tips of teeth appear flattenedWhat to do if you think you may be grinding your teeth?\nIf you think you might be grinding your teeth at night, the first thing to do is visit your dentist in noida to assess any possible damage. It’s essential to halt the course of the disease to prevent or arrest damage to your teeth, gums, and jaws.Dr. Reena Gupta marrkarnell: People who suffer from bruxism usually is prone to unusual headaches and migraine, ear aches, tooth mobility and tooth loss, etc. This is due to the force exerted among the teeth that causes pressure to the neighboring body parts. Teeth can also be easily worn out."

    "dialogue": "soniafreedman: I'm having problems and pain on my teeth. I hear that colloidal silver is good to for mouth problems, but I don't want to make it myself I can't even find were to buy distilled water, so I looked on the forums and found mouthcoloid mouthwash. So does anyone used it? is it modified? Can I use it? suevivaconcepts: My mother has used this OTC treatments. And it seems to help her. There are many online homeopathic sites that offer this quite afford ably as well as Wholefoods, Trader Joes, and Sprouts, here in California.Taken from Wikipedia. \nThe medical uses of silver include its incorporation into wound dressings, creams, and as an antibiotic coating on medical devices. While wound dressings containing silver sulfadiazine or silver nanomaterials may be used on external infections,[1][2][3] there is little evidence to support such use.[4] There is tentative evidence that silver coatings on urinary catheters and endotracheal breathing tubes may reduce the incidence of catheter-related urinary tract infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia, respectively.[5][6] The silver ion (Ag+) is bioactive and in sufficient concentration readily kills bacteria in vitro. Silver exhibits low toxicity in the human body, and minimal risk is expected due to clinical exposure by inhalation, ingestion, dermal application.[7] Silver and silver nanoparticles are used as an antimicrobial in a variety of industrial, healthcare and domestic applications.[8]\nColloidal silver (a colloid consisting of silver particles suspended in liquid) and formulations containing silver salts were used by physicians in the early 20th century, but their use was largely discontinued in the 1940s following the development of safer and effective modern antibiotics.[9][10] Since the 1990s, colloidal silver has again been marketed as an alternative medicine, often with extensive \"cure-all\" claims. Colloidal silver products remain available in many countries as dietary supplements and homeopathic remedies, although they are not effective in treating any known condition and carry the risk of serious side effects such as argyria, allergic reactions, and interactions with prescription medications.[11][12] marrkarnell: Since silver is known as infection-treating element, then it could be effective.

Please see this picturebit.ly/16aWqspIt won't let me put the link because I am new member but try bit(dot)ly(forward slash)16aWqspI think this is case sensetive, this last part the W must be capitalThe mouth on the left is the boy who uses a pacifier, and the mouth on the right is the girl. His teeth look asymmetric, and some look short esp the ? first upper left incisor, and the one next to that. Also some along the maxilla side look maybe short. Am I correct in my viewing of this? The girl's teeth look perfect and straight to me. Is this irreversable? If he stops using the pacifier now, will these teeth grow longer and assume a normal shape and orientation of the teeth or will his teeth always look crooked, including when he sheds the milk teeth and grows adult teeth? What's the worst thing that can happen if he keeps using this pacifier until, say 3 years old? I want to show my husband some info from people who are experts. Of course we are going to the dentist soon, when we can get an appointment (the pediatric dentist here are full for months), but wanted some info beforehand. I appreciate all your help.

    "title": "A guide to Enlighten Teeth Whitening",
    "dialogue": "rosiebruce: Tooth whitening is becoming more and more popular in the UK. As more and more people look for affordable opportunities to improve the quality of their smile, there are more products available, new brands appearing and more dentists with the technology to deliver different treatments and solutions.Enlighten is a technological leader in professional teeth whitening. A US-based research laboratory, they pride themselves on their ability to produce cutting-edge products that really make a visible difference to your smile and your self-confidence.One of the major challenges for manufacturers of tooth whitening kits was to create effective products without using substances that were harsh enough to damage teeth and cause the patient unnecessary pain. In the 18th Century, when barber shops also often performed the role of community dentist, teeth were whitened using acid. It did the job, but unfortunately also corroded the tooth enamel and led to severe tooth decay in the future.Since then (thankfully), the science of tooth whitening has evolved in an advanced practice. At the leading edge of this practice is Enlighten, who have developed a comprehensive suite of tooth whitening products that perform consistently well against the competition. The Enlighten range includes kits for both home use and dentist applied, with varying strengths and modes of application.The key to the success of Enlighten is that it works safely and painlessly, yet at the same time it also provides predicable results. The main brand in the Enlighten stable is called Evolution. Depending on how your teeth are at the beginning of the process, Enlighten Evolution can whiten your teeth by up to ten shades. In fact, Enlighten claim that Evolution is the only product to guarantee that any patient will whiten to at least B1.Guaranteeing a certain standard of whiteness from a tooth whitening product is very difficult. This is because every patient is an individual case. We all have slightly different teeth – some can be more porous for example – and we all have slightly different lifestyles and diets. It all impacts on how much our teeth stain and lose their natural shine. However, Enlighten products claim to work effectively in virtually every case.The Evolution brand is also adaptable enough to meet different patient requirements. You should talk to your dentist about which approach might be right for your teeth. You could choose an Evolution Kit which involves primarily home whitening. This normally takes around four weeks and there are different strength kits available, depending on how stained your teeth are.Alternatively, Evolution also offers a kit which is partly home whitening and partly in-practice whitening. Under dental supervision, the final part of the whitening process is done at a much stronger strength, so that you see results faster. Finally, you can have the Evolution treatment in just one dental appointment – so you will see the difference in your teeth in just 60 minutes!In each type of kit, the same technology and products are used – only the strengths vary. The Evolution process is also broadly the same, whether you use a home kit or add in a dental appointment. Teeth are whitening using the special ‘Evo gel’ which is added to trays Each kit also includes Enlighten’s own desensitiser, which helps your teeth acclimatise to the whitening products.Sensitivity can be a side-effect of tooth whitening. However, at no point does the Evolution system damage the enamel of your teeth or harm your gums in any way, shape or form.The Enlighten Evolution system is proven to be effective at whitening teeth. On average, your teeth will normally maintain their whiteness for around three years before you need a top-up treatment. Once you have had your teeth whitened, it is important that you continue to look after them properly if you want to maintain the best results. Changing your diet can help to protect the whiteness of your teeth, especially if you drink a lot of coffee or red wine for example.In a crowded market, Evolution is a product that really stands out. Comfortable, patient-friendly and affordable, it can make a significant difference to the quality of your smile. danielhermann: Thanks for sharing this information rosiebruce. Teeth whitening is very popular now a days. There are some home remedies also which help you to whiten your teeth naturally. You can also recommend them if you want. Nerve: I want to get my teeth whitened but it would probably mean my crown would match anymore. marrkarnell: i just wanna share something blue covarine. they say taht it makes an optical illusion making your teeth look less yellow (in case) when used with toothpaste"

    "title": "Teeth Whitening Legislation",
    "dialogue": "smiles4less: The law relating to teeth whitening changed on 31 October 2012. The new law increases the percentage of hydrogen peroxide allowed in tooth whitening or bleaching products to 6%, subject to conditions which include first use by a dental practitioner or under their direct supervision. Until 31 October the previous law remained in force and this position statement relates to treatment provided after 31 October 2012.Dental Protection welcomes the change in the law, which will allow practitioners to act in their patients’ best interests whilst remaining within the law. The legislation relating to tooth whitening is laid down by the European Union and the change to the law follows many years of lobbying by dental groups. The new law draws a clear line between the products that can legally be used for tooth whitening by dentists or under their direct supervision and the products that can be purchased by non-dental professionals.The change follows as an amendment to the EU Directive 76/768/EEC concerning cosmetic products. The amending Council Directive 2011/84/EU was published in September 2011 requiring the UK Government to amend the law. The Cosmetic Products (Safety) (Amendment) Regulations 2012 (The ‘Regulations’) amend the previous regulations relating to tooth whitening.The new Regulations allow the use of hydrogen peroxide and other compounds or mixtures that release hydrogen peroxide, including carbamide peroxide and zinc peroxide to be used for tooth whitening. The maximum concentration that may be used for tooth whitening under the Regulations is 6% present or released. In very broad terms and as a general guide, a percentage expressed in terms of carbamide peroxide content will release one third of that level of hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the commonly used products containing 16% carbamide peroxide would be permitted under the revised Regulations because they would normally be releasing less than 6% hydrogen peroxide.The Regulations set out that products containing or releasing up to 6% hydrogen peroxide can be used, subject to conditions:To only be sold to dental practitioners\nFor each cycle of use, first use by a dental practitioner; or\nUnder their direct supervision, if an equivalent level of safety is to be ensured.\nAfterwards to be provided to the consumer to complete the cycle of use.\nNot to be used on a person under 18 years of age.\nIt is appropriate for the dentist to carry out an examination before embarking on a course of tooth whitening, to determine whether tooth whitening is a suitable treatment option for the patient. A detailed contemporaneous record should be kept of this examination, detailing the consent process including your discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the treatment."

    "dialogue": "cttech2013: First and foremost I am licensed and registered in general radiography and computed tomography. This is a long overdue warning to any dentists, cosmetic surgeons, ENT's, orthodontists etc etc in the market for a sit down dental CT scanner. STAY AWAY FROM THE ILUMA CT Scanner by IMTEC/3M!!!!!  The most significant problem with this thing (there are many) is the lack of head support for the patient. If you google image \"iluma ct scanner\" you will notice that there is no support for the back of the patients head once they sit in the chair, only a chin cup. If you examine further however on the white colored models (the one I use) there is a head rest. After months of having to do repeat scans due to motion I noticed  an ad for the scanner in a medical journal. A head rest was affixed to the back of the chair in the ad but I however had no such piece on my scanner. How come? I figured I could call Imtec mention the ad and have them send me this piece because for some reason they forgot to give it to me in the first place. Problem solved no more motion. Keep in mind I had already mentioned to their service dept the need for greater head support multiple times although they never brought up the piece. Anyway another call to Imtec, I mention my discovery and out of the mouths of these people themselves. \"We don't provide that piece anymore because when the gantry spins around the patient it slams into the head rest\". What!?? They were knowingly advertising and selling a machine with a major defect. Not long after my expose phone call did I notice a revamp of their web page without images of the defected scanner, but there's still a catch. They still sell the exact same unit, just a different color(black), still without the head piece. Repeats and motion filled scans galore. I'm not even going to get into how the gantry constantly bumps into larger PT's shoulders as well. To think people could actually complicate the idea of just sitting in a chair. Just want to add that there are multiple people who share a negative opinion of this piece of equipment. ENT's, radiographers, PA's, radiologists, NP's, oral surgeons/dentists and of course patients.

    "title": "A guide to Gum Recession",
    "dialogue": "rosiebruce: Receding gums can be caused by a number of reasons. But one of the biggest problems is that it is actually quite a difficult condition to spot. If the gums are receding very slowly, it is always difficult to identify very gradual erosion. By then, it could be too late to take the necessary steps to slow it down.Gum recession is most common in people over the age of 40. However, you could probably amend that to say that it is identified most often when people are in their Forties. In many cases, the gums have begun to recede very slowly before that so there was probably several opportunities for them to be diagnosed and for treatment to start.So what causes your gums to recede? In the first instance, it can be something as simply as brushing your teeth too hard. We all want to get our teeth as clean as possible, but it is important that you clean your teeth in the right way. Your dentist can explain the right approach to oral hygiene and demonstrate brushing techniques that can ensure that your gums are not damaged. They will also be able to recommend an appropriate toothbrush.A more serious cause of receding gums is gum disease. If plaque and bacteria are allowed to build up on your teeth, then the bacteria can attack the gums and become embedded into gaps between the gums and the roots of the teeth. Advanced gum disease will need to be treated by a dentist. In the majority of cases, it involves a deep clean of your teeth which includes clearing out the hardened plaque from between the gums and around the roots of the teeth. It requires a local anaesthetic as it can be painful.The third most common reason for gum recession is orthodontic treatment. When teeth are moved into a better position through an orthodontic treatment, it can often result in the roots of the teeth becoming more prominent. So as the tops of the teeth move to become straighter and to refine the bite and smile, the roots of the teeth can be pushed in the other direction and appear more visible above the gum line.In cases of serious gum recession, either caused by gum disease or by orthodontic treatment, the only solution may be surgery. Gingival grafting is a treatment that involves grafts from either neighbouring gums or the roof of the mouth onto the affects areas. The surgical procedure is usually performed by a specialist periodontist rather than a dentist and the patient will require a local anaesthetic. Your new gums will usually be healed within the space of about a month. In some cases, once the gums have healed the periodontist may be required to perform some additional shaping to ensure that the gum grafts look as natural as possible.If you are concerned about your gums receding, there are a number of symptoms that you can watch out for. Of course, you should keep an eye on your gums, but it can be difficult to tell whether they are receding or not unless you have a professional eye. However, if you find that your teeth are becoming more sensitive, this can be an indication that more of your tooth is becoming exposed as the gums recede.You may also notice a change in the colour of some of your teeth. As the gums recede, the lower part of the tooth which becomes exposed may be whiter than the original crown of the tooth.It is important that you take responsibility for the health of your own teeth. However, one of the most important things you can do is regularly visit your dentist. As a professional, you dentist will be able to spot whether plaque is building up on your teeth and causing gum disease. They will also be able to identify whether you have cavities below the gum line, which is another indication that gum disease is causing your gums to recede.Regular visits to your dentist should mean that problems are spotted early and dealt with accordingly. If this happens, then you should be able to maintain healthy gums and healthy teeth for a long time beyond your Forties. Johnh: Good and reliable information. I was also a victim of gum disease, Thanks for good docs who really helped me out and get me out from these painful disease . chrp123: You may also notice your gums recede post root surface instrumentation, but this is to be expected as the biofilm is disturbed, the inflammation around the tooth reduces new gingival attachment forms"

In fact, most of us hate fillings so much that we can’t bear to think about them, talk about them, look at them or even ask our dentists about them. Most of us, when we visit the dentist for a routine check-up, will simply sit there, stare at the ceiling and hope that the dreaded ‘f’ word doesn’t crop up in conversation.Well, the fact is that we usually will have to discuss the ‘f’ word with our dentists, because sooner or later, most of us will need a filling (even if it is just a little one). Fillings are one of the most routine dental procedures which most dentists perform every day. But because we hate fillings so much, many of us don’t know too much about them. And, there are definitely some things that you really should know about fillings...The good news is that there is now a much more diverse range of fillings available to choose from than there ever has been in the past. The bad news is that new types of fillings (such as white fillings) are often more expensive than standard treatments and most dentists would only recommend the extra cost for a very visible cavity. That’s why the majority of patients with a tooth cavity will usually end up with an ‘amalgam’.Amalgam fillings are the traditional type of fillings that are usually black in colour. They are made from an amalgamation of a number of different metals which usually include tin, silver, copper and mercury - hence the colour. While amalgams are not the most visually attractive option for filling a cavity, they have the advantage of being very durable. This means that they can withstand the constant demands of chewing or tooth-grinding without breaking down or coming loose.So amalgams have their plus points – of course, they’ve been used by dentists to fill cavities for decades, so you would expect them to. However, there is also one very important negative issue surrounding amalgams. Many people are against amalgam fillings because they contain mercury – which is very toxic to human beings.The debate around the toxicity of the mercury in amalgam fillings has been raging for several years. According to the most recent research, around 8 million cavities in the UK are filled with amalgams each year. However, anti-amalgam campaigners (of which there is a growing number) claim that the mercury in amalgams is responsible for a variety of health issues, from headaches to Alzheimer’s disease.So let’s look at the two sides of the debate. On one side are the authorities such as the FDA and the British Dental Association, who claim that the mercury in amalgams is tightly bonded into a compound with the other elements in your filling, so it poses no threat to your health. On the other side are a band of alternative therapists, dentists and even national governments such as Norway and Denmark, who believe that amalgams release mercury vapours which can contaminate your bloodstream. In Norway, Denmark and a number of other countries, amalgams are no longer recommended by dentists.If you are concerned about amalgam fillings and the effect that they could have on or your children’s health, then there are a number of steps that you can take. First of all, speak to your dentist and find out their views on the subject. There are now many dentists in the UK who choose not to work with amalgams and prefer to only recommend other types of filling.When you talk to your dentist, ask him or her about other options for fillings cavities. You may be surprised by how many choices you have. Whereas they can be more expensive than the cheaper amalgam, you could talk to your dentist about composite resins, glass or ceramic fillings – none of which contain mercury.Finally, what can you do if you already have amalgam fillings – after all, most of us with NHS dentists probably do. It is possible to have you amalgam fillings replaced. Once again, talk to your dentist who will be able to explain much more about the procedure. There is a standard protocol involved which will ensure that the mercury is kept bonded within the amalgam while it is removed - ensuring that the filling can be replaced safely."

    "title": "A guide to Flourosis",
    "dialogue": "rosiebruce: If you’re a parent, you are probably already aware of the debate surrounding flouride. Fouride is added to much of the drinking water in the UK before it reaches our homes. Many people see this as one of the key factors in reducing tooth decay and improving oral hygiene across the UK.However, there is another side to the debate. There are many opponents to flouride in water as too much flouride can actually be detrimental to the health of our children’s teeth. Too much flouride can cause a condition known as flourosis in children.So what is flourosis? To put it simply, too much flouride causes the teeth to become discoloured. However, it does not affect adults. Flourosis only affects children as their adult teeth are emerging. It causes white, yellow and brown spots to form on the tooth enamel. Luckily, the symptoms of flourosis are no more serious than that. It is a disease with purely cosmetic implications for your teeth. Once teeth have fully developed into the adult stage, flourosis no longer develops.There are some cases of flourosis that are so minimal that most people do not even realise that they have it. It won’t cause your teeth to ache or your gums to rot. Sometimes, only your dentist can notice you have it.However, there are other cases where the teeth can be visibly discoloured. And while the disease is not serious, it can affect a child’s confidence and self-esteem just as they are growing up and becoming more aware of how they look. Therefore, most parents are very keen to ensure that their child does not develop flourosis.This is at the heart of the debate about whether flouride should be added to our drinking water. From one point of view, flouride is vital in strengthening the tooth enamel as your child grows up. In fact, it is fair to say that flouride is your most important ally in fighting tooth decay. However, from another point of view, it can be a contributing factor to flourosis for a small number of children.If you have concerns about your child’s teeth, the best thing to do is to talk to your dentist about it. Your dentist will be able to examine your child’s teeth and evaluate whether tooth decay is likely to be a problem or whether there are any early signs of flourosis. This will enable your dentist to form a professional opinion on how much flouride your child needs.Therefore, parents should be conscious of the need to balance protecting their child’s teeth against exposing their child to too much flouride. However, many cases of flouride simply come about because children are swallowing toothpaste or using an additional flouride mouthwash. Some parents give their children flouride supplements – which you should avoid doing unless your dentist specifically recommends it.Of course, flouride is not the only way to protect against tooth decay. You should ensure that your child maintains a good all-round oral health and hygiene routine, which includes avoiding too many sugary snacks, cleaning their teeth twice every day and using a small amount of flouride toothpaste. If you child sticks to this regime, then they should develop healthy adult teeth.Finally, what if you are an adult who developed flourosis as a child? Is there anything that you can now do to improve the cosmetic appearance of your teeth? Flouride is not a degenerative disease so it will not cause your teeth to decay. Therefore, the majority of dental treatments available to you are the same as the treatments available to other people with discoloured teeth.Therefore, tooth whitening is an option which many people can consider. There are now a variety of whitening techniques, treatments and brands available, to suit a broad range of budgets. Another possibility are veneers, which cover your teeth with a suitable material such as porcelaine, which creates a perfect, natural smile.To find out more about the techniques available for restoring your teeth after flourosis, you should speak to your dentist."

    "title": "A guide to Emergency Dentistry",
    "dialogue": "rosiebruce: Most of us are used to visiting the dentist every six months or so. If you get into good habits from an early age, going for those routine check-ups just becomes second nature. Thankfully, dental emergencies are few and far between for most us. But that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t prepare yourself and make sure you’re fully equipped for every eventuality.This article is a step-by-step look at what you need to know and what you need to do in a dental emergency. It will answer the following questions - What exactly constitutes a dental emergency? What can you do to prepare for them? And what can you do if it actually happens?The good news is that, if you require some emergency dental work, it won’t only be you who will be fully prepared. Your dentist will make provision for the arrival of emergency cases and ensure that their schedule is flexible enough to deal with unexpected issues. So if something happens, you first port of call should be your dentist. Depending on the severity of your situation, they will usually fit you in for an appointment on the same day.Most dentists have an emergency out-of-hours contact number, as well as the standard reception number, so it is worth making a note of both of these. Alternatively, if you cannot contact your dentist, you can call NHS Direct who will be able to put you in touch with your nearest emergency dentist.So now you know who to contact. But what constitutes a dental emergency? Is a lost filling an emergency? Or are we only talking severe trauma and missing teeth?\nThere are a number of scenarios in which you may feel you need to contact a dentist immediately. Broadly speaking, these can fall into two categories: visible damage to your teeth or the onset of pain which signals underlying causes such as decay.Visible damage to teeth is a fairly common occurance. Teeth can be chipped, cracked, split, knocked in and knocked out. It can happen while you are playing sport, if you trip and fall over or even if you bite down unexpectedly on something hard and crunchy, like a peanut. Much of the time, there is very little we can do about it and not much we can do to avoid it. File under accidental and contact your dentist.The second type of dental emergency is when the pain is caused by underlying decay. If you are visiting your dentist regularly, tooth decay should be spotted and treated before it becomes too serious. However, if you have not been visiting your dentist regularly, then tooth decay may take hold and work its way into your tooth. This is normally treated easily with a filling, which will stop the pain. In some cases, however, it may escalate into an abscess, which can create the onset of sudden, unbearable pain that requires immediate dental care.This is a common situation for people with dental phobia. Their fear of the dentist means that they avoid routine check-ups and try to ignore minor toothaches. The problem is that the underlying causes of the toothache will not go away; so they face more pain and more serious dental work further down the line.Can you prepare for dental emergencies? It can help to keep a dental first aid kit at home which contains some essentials until you can reach a dentist. Painkillers should obviously be included. You may also want to include some antiseptic mouthwash and cotton wool pads, which can be used to stem bleeding. Finally, don’t forget your sugar free gum. It sounds like strange advice, but it is the perfect thing for plugging the gap if a filling falls out – don’t forget, it’s only a temporary solution though!And what about that lost filling? Does that really constitute a dental emergency? Toothache can be very painful and disruptive, and it will only get worse. So don’t be afraid to call your dentist and request an emergency appointment. Once your dentist has looked at your tooth, they can decide what needs to be done. If it is an emergency, they may choose to treat you there and then. Alternatively, they can give you a temporary filling and schedule you in for a proper appointment. Either way, it will solve the pain and give you peace of mind."

    "title": "just say no to fixed bridges",
    "dialogue": "Thomas Bird: No matter what your dentist tell you, permanent bridges are most certainly NOT permanent. I have been through two of them and I would never recommend anyone to get one of those horrible things. All a bridge does is trade in one set of dental problems for an even greater set of dental problems later on. If you get 10 years out of your bridge it is a small miracle and after that bridge fails if your roots are strong enough to handle another one afterwards it is an even greater miracle. After that you are looking at a denture. Fixed bridges make absolutely no sense. Destroying good teeth to fill spaces is an extremely risky proposition to begin with, but what your dentist won't tell you is the myriad of problems that an occur:1. if you damage one of the crowns you most likely must replace the entire bridge\n2. if you get a cavity under the bridge you are positively screwed\n3. bridges place a tremendous amount of stress on your roots and greatly increase the likelihood of one of your other teeth failing.\n4. bridges are terribly painful and expensive to replace\n5. upper bridges grind down teeth below them like a soap stone\n6. when your bridge fails (and it WILL fail eventually), your only real option will be a partial denture.KEEP YOUR NATURAL TEETH ALWAYS! Bridges do nothing but trade small dental problems for big ones later on. If you have one space your trying to fix, when you do a 3 crown bridge you will soon have 3 spaces to worry about instead of only one. JUST SAY NO TO FIXED BRIDGES! THEY ARE A WASTE OF TIME AND ALL THEY DO IS PUT MORE MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF CROOKED DENTISTS! sqwerl: Bridges are a great option but are obviously not for everyone and the trade-offs should be discussed with your dentist. If your dentist lead you to believe your bridges would last a lifetime then either he/she wasn't truthful or you didn't ask the right questions. Bridges can last as few as 2-3 years but this is often due to poor hygiene and not having routine cleanings. They have been known to last as long as 25 years or more. Life of the bridge can also be affected by diabetes, periodontal or other diseases.The key to replacing missing teeth with dental fixtures is sustaining the life of the remaining teeth. Removable partial dentures would be my last option as they have been shown to either increase tooth loss greater than a fixed bridge or at least didn't help the survival rate of remaining teeth like fixed bridges have been shown to do. Some studies have shown removable partial dentures increase abutment tooth loss from 17% to 30% at 4-7 years yet  have also shown tooth supported bridges improve survival with tooth loss from 7%-10%.Your options after a bridge failure aren't always limited to only partial dentures as you claim. Many people have the option of another bridge that sometimes can be attached to stronger teeth than the original bridge. You also have the option of dental implants which usually significantly increase the rate of tooth survival over partial dentures and even bridges. There are also more risks with implants however and they are usually quite expensive.Ultimately someone should research all options and meet with several different dentists to discuss the trade-offs before they decide on a replacement option. They shouldn't rely on the wild speculation and extremely biased information from the banned user above. Bert: Implant is certainly the first option to replace a missing tooth. Now a days there are very little contra-indications. Fixed bridge is the second option. And the decision is made ultimately around the financial situation.\nbest of luck,\nBert rob55: A fixed bridge will do just that - bridge the gap left by a missing tooth or teeth with a new, false tooth that is attached to your natural surrounding teeth via crowns. A fixed bridge is not removable, but it does look natural and is a successful way to replace a missing tooth that will last - making sure that you have a beautiful, complete smile for years. Bertram Boniface: Why was Thomas Bird banned?\nHe just sounds as though he has had some thoroughly bad treattment carried out and is rightly upset and angry. Much of what he says is true.\n1. If you damage one unit, then repair if possible, is difficult. Often the bridge has to be remade.\n2. If you get a cavity under the bridge then this can indeed jeopardise the whole bridge. Cavities are rare under well fitting bridgework but unfortunately well fitting bridgework is also rare.\n3. If well designed and executed, bridges do not unduly stress the supporting teeth.\nUnfortunately a great deal of bridgework is substandard and does indeed lead to further tooth loss.\n4. High quality dentistry, like anything else of high quality, tends to be costly.\nBy and large you get what you pay for. If you buy cheap dentistry be prepared for trouble. Unfortunately not all costly dentistry is good dentistry.There is absolutely no excuse for dental treatment being \"terribly painful\" - you are seeing the wrong dentist.\n5.If a bridge has the wrong bite relationship with the opposing teeth, it can indeed cause accelerated wear, discomfort and further trouble. If the bridge is adjusted and then not repolished and reglazed, the wear can be very severe.\n5.In time, everything fails, that is inevitable. However how long a bridge lasts before it fails depends on (i) how well it was made and (ii) how well it was looked after. Bad bridgework (which is common) fails within three or four years. Good bridgework can and should last for at least twenty years. Mine did. However if you put beautifully made bridgework into a filthy and neglected mouth then that will fail pretty quickly too.\nAll too often bad bridgework causes more problems than it solves and sadly too many dentists are either incompetent or dihonest or both. Were that not the case, there would be far fewer angry patients suing their dentists. dentalguy23: Thomas Bird said:\t\t\tJUST SAY NO TO FIXED BRIDGES! THEY ARE A WASTE OF TIME AND ALL THEY DO IS PUT MORE MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF CROOKED DENTISTS!\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nNot sure if that is a fair statement.

    "dialogue": "skinniman: Okay, I have a tooth that lost a ten year old filling a few months ago and have been having toothaches in it that last from 15 minutes to an hour when I eat foods that are hot.For the last couple of weeks those toothaches have went away but have been replaced by a new much shorter toothache that is literally 100 times worse.  They come in very short bursts, less that a second long, and maybe like 5 or so times within a few minute period.  These don't come when eating but rather out of the blue and, oddly enough, only in the afternoon/early evening.But I can not stress enough that this pain is excruciating and tolerable only because they are such short bursts, but today I had one that lasted over 5 seconds and I fear they will get worse.  I've had some bad toothaches in my life and I tell you this far far worse that any pain I've ever felt anywhere on my body.  If they get any longer I don't know how I will be able to tolerate them.Now, the real problem lies in the fact that right now I am unemployed and am only eating by the good grace of my family, but I have NO ONE I can turn to for the $ it would take for a root canal.  On top of that I had to have the tooth directly behind it pulled due to not being able to afford a root canal and if this one gets pulled I won't be able to chew on that side at all.  Plus on the other side a ten year old crown and the post it's on recently just fell out so chewing on the other side is problematic as well.I'm only 40 years old and I'm looking at a liquid diet.My question is if there are dentists that deal with people with extreme situations and little to no money to deal with them?  All the dentists I call will only quote their prices and they're way too high for me even to consider."

Minerals in the peel like potassium, magnesium and manganese absorb into your teeth and can whiten them. Bert: I can hardly believe that that works.\nI would even suggest that might have the opposite effect.\ngood luck! rob55: Use a ripe banana as it has the most potassium content in it.

It also can be a result of the body's reaction when the teeth do not line up or come together properly. It also can be a symptom of certain rare diseases of the nerves and muscles in the face. domtoreto: Teeth grinding is known in medical terms as bruxism. Grinding and clenching teeth during sleep is very common. Grinding your teeth at night is usually caused by having stress and not dealing with it the right way. And if thats the case of yours as well, consider taking advice of a dentist as well as doctor to prevent grinding teeth. danielhermann: The main reason of grinding and clenching is stress. \nClenching may do more harm than grinding because clenching can cause degeneration in the joint.\nThere are some tips to stop grinding and clenching.* Take a warm bath before bedtime. It can relax your jaw temporarily.* Do exercise or a walk. They may help to relieve your tension and stress. As i said the main reason of grinding and clenching is stress.* Remind yourself not to clench. Do anything which will remind you to keep your jaw relax. for example any dot on your cell phone or watch, sticky note etc. rob55: Keep your lips sealed, but your teeth apart. Your teeth should be touching only when you're chewing or swallowing. Drop your jaw and feel the muscles relax -- then try to maintain that feeling.Take a warm bath before bedtime. The warmth of the water may temporarily relax your jaw muscles.Exercise. Your body, not your jaw, that is. A walk or other mild exercise may help relieve some of the tension and stress that's causing bruxism. johnmoran12: Bruxism is clenching or grinding your teeth. Most people are not even aware that they are doing this. In the United States, bruxism affects about 30 million to 40 million children and adults.Some people grind their teeth only during sleep. This is called \"nocturnal bruxism\" or \"sleep-related bruxism.\" Others grind or clench their teeth during the daytime as well. This is thought to be related to stress or anxiety. Stress can occur for many reasons, including sad and painful events such as the death of a loved one or the loss of a job. It can also occur from joyous events such as a new job or the birth of a baby."

    "dialogue": "Brandonwil86: I had a few fillings done a few weeks ago.Between then and yesterday everything was fine.I woke up this morning and now they are sensitive to perssure.Any suggestions? domtoreto: One of the reason why your teeth are sensitive is that deeper fillings could take a lot longer to settle down. Other possible causes could be that there is some inflammation in the tooth making it more sensitive to contact, maybe a high spot on the filling that needs adjusting. rob55: Every filling is a little different. Your tooth has a nerve in the middle, surrounded by a sort of bony material called dentin, and then a coating of enamel on the outside. When the dentist drills into the tooth and then fills the hole with this foreign material, the nerve is perturbed. Once the novocaine wears off, you feel soreness, more or less depending on how close he got to the nerve, how much damage is done.The tooth then begins to heal by growing more dentin around the nerve. The nerve can even grow over to the side, 'out of the way' of the foreign material. This is called 'secondary dentin', and it takes a while to grow. So for a few days, maybe even weeks, it will be more sensitive than before. Sometimes the filling doesn't even go near the nerve and you don't even feel it. Other times it just destroys the nerve and it will be touchy for a long time.You know, if a doctor cut you open to take out some organ or something, he sews it up where he cut you open. It takes about a week for the skin to grow together so they can take out the stitches, but it will take a much longer time to heal completely. Maybe a year! It's like that with teeth too.BTW the short needle is called a 'ligajet'. It's something new, injecting the anesthetic right into the 'ligature' between the tooth and the jaw. It can be used to anesthetise a single tooth instead of the whole side. I kind of like it! (You can see, I've had a lot of dental work.)I'd say give it a week or two. It should get slowly better. As long as it's getting better, not as painful as a few days before, I'd say it was okay. If it doesn't get better, I'd call the dentist and see if he needs to do something more."

    "dialogue": "pchant: Hello,I've been having this jaw problem since I was 16, and I am now 36. Long story short, 20 years ago I opened my mouth too wide and it got stuck, and I got so panic that I force-closed it. I went closed, but since then my my upper and lower teeth have misaligned and my face not symmetrical, and also I have clicking sound. I went to a dentist 15 years ago, and he said if I could chew without any problem a surgery is not recommended. The thing is my face now is more asymmetrical, and my clicking sound seems to be happening much more often. Is there any way to have my jaw fixed back to normal?Best,\nPol domtoreto: A well experienced dentist can only advise you in this situation. Hence, instead of taking and trying things, I would recommend you to visit a professional dentist who can help you to get rid of this problem. rob55: Natural Treatment Plan For Jaw PainHere are some thoughts and guidelines that I keep in mind when looking to help people achieve long term relief from jaw pain and dysfunction:    Except for cases in which there is an overt subluxation or frank dislocation of the temporo-mandibular joint, it is best not to do any direct work to this joint. The temporo-mandibular joint has a disc that is critical in allowing the joint to work properly. This disc is very delicate and easily damaged when abrupt mechanical force is applied to the region. Such damage and potential ensuing scar tissue formation can create structural changes to the region that can lead to permanent problems.    Try not to chew gum. As I mentioned in an article that I wrote on why chewing gum isn't great for your health, over time, unnecessary use of your muscles of mastication can damage these muscles and the disc that lies in the temporo-mandibular joint.    Stretch your neck on a regular basis. Tight neck muscles and/or dysfunction in the joints of your neck can contribute to improper movement of your temporo-mandibular joints. For a description of simple neck exercises that you can do daily,"

    "title": "Pain After Tooth Extraction",
    "dialogue": "Jimborino: A week ago today I had molar #19 pulled due to a horrible toothache. Turns out there was a small abscese in the root of the tooth. The dentist while pulling the tooth out broke the bone in my gum socket(from the sound of when he was pulling it I asked if it was cartiledge and he said it was my bone breaking) After the extraction he told me to put some pressure on my gum to close the larger then should be hole he left in my head. The wound healed fine(withing an hour it stopped bleeding). After examining where he had pulled it I noticed a good sized cavity that was hiding between the tooth he had pulled and the molar behind it. I don't have any noticeable swelling but the spot where he had pulled my tooth is still sore and my gum is still swollen from where he had said he broke the bone pulling the tooth(nothing crazy just small swelling on the outside of the tooth cavity).The molar that was behind the tooth he pulled is very sensitive but nothing compared to how my tooth felt before he had pulled it. I was just wondering if the pain and small swelling I feel are normal when the gumline is fractured or if I should go back to the dentist(I don't have insurance and could hardly afford the tooth being pulled so it's not a no brainer to go back for me like it would be for most people.)Thank you for your time. fredravez: Hi,Your problem is really painful. To reduce swelling you can do any home remedy. That will help.Regards\nFred westiegal: I rode my pain out for a long time. It came and went, sometimes disappearing for a few months. But it always came back worse. Eventually I just had to suck it up and pay for the work. joe joe: When the teeth is pulled out,its quiet normal to have that pain,try to wash your mouth with salt water.If the pain still exist,go to the dentist,that will be better. jpsmith: sad and painful story..\nyou could use a warm and salty water to ease the pain but don't swallow it, might upset your stomach. you can take pain relievers. you also can use salt and ginger, make a paste out of it then rub it on the affected area.. jpsmith: you can also use lemon juice and water at least twice a day. stevepolard: Avoid hot foods or drinks until the numbing wears off. You cannot feel pain while you are numb and may burn your mouth. Also take care not to accidentally chew your cheek. nancy1729: Unfortunately for some, pain does stick around for a while after an extraction. Best thing you can do is to wait it out with loads of painkillers and laying down! \nHave you tried elevating your head? With a few extra pillows? The blood flow is lessend by this, and pressure around the area calms a little. Ice pack on the outside will help - but remember not to leave it on any longer than 10 minutes at a time (10 mins on 10 mins off essentially). Remember not to use a heat pad! Heat on the area will not help with swelling and can make the area a lot more painful! Try not to have any 'hot' soup or 'hot' tea - cool jelly, not completely icy ice-cream and loads of water will help (Basically try not to go to the 'extremes' of the cold and hot registers) Hope it starts to feel better soon! Mark Brown: This is very awe-full situation. In such a case one should consult some other dentist or a physician to get free from the pain and get a treatment soon as chances of swelling and infection persist even if you clean your mouth well after any meal. As per the basic solution to get relief from pain do avoid hot fluids as it relaxes the muscles. gotbfdk: hi there it sounds like u got an infection so its best to go back domtoreto: Most people experience some pain and swelling after having a tooth extracted. It is normal to feel some pain after the anesthesia wears off. If you develop new or worsening pain in the days after your tooth extraction, don't try to tough it out."

    "dialogue": "Baddad: Two years ago my dentist said that I had minor decay on a tooth but nothing that needed attention at the time, he Said that we would keep an eye on it. Since then I have been to see him numerouse times for regular cleanings and exams plus some other minor work. At no time did he mention that tooth. 3 months ago after a regular cleaning he said that not only did i need a crown on that tooth but the decay had spread to the tooth in front of it and it also needed a crown. To make a long story short he gave me a discount and we did the two crowns. After two months the original tooth had not settled down so he decided to redo the crown. Now two months later I still cannot put any pressure on the tooth and he says that I need a root canal to fix this. What should I do Bert: Apparently there was negligence. X-ray might have been a better monitoring option. \nNow it is too late.\nIt is hard to say if you really need a root canal treatment. Not enough info given. But it is possible. But for what I get from you, it is likely that your crown is or was high. That would have cause a over charge(weight) in this specific tooth and therefore injured the tissues close to the root tip, causing pain when you bite. \nBest of luck,\nBert"

I only feel this pain when I'm eating and food hits in the area or when I'm brushing my teeth and use too much pressure in that specific area. I can't exactly pinpoint whether it's on the backside of my gum line or the front. I have a small space between the two front teeth so I can definitely tell that this is the focal point area of the pain. I have checked and can't really see any lesions or redness so I'm confused of where the pain could be coming from. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and thanks in advance for your assistance. gotbfdk: Go see a dentist quick for a cleaning. You have gum disease witch can be reversed. If the swelling spread to the other teeth, it creates pockets called periodontal disease. You dont want that. Get a soft bristle toothbrush. When u brush and your gums bleed, keep brushing. Start flossing or get aa water pick flosser. Cool92: Thanks for the response. I just had a cleaning less than one month ago and there was nothing said about gum disease. In fact, the dentist said my gums were healthy. My gums are a healthy pink color and never bleed. domtoreto: From my point of view, tooth sensitivity is tooth discomfort after eating cold or hot foods or liquids or even breathing cold air. If your gums shrink, they can expose some of the roots of your teeth, making them sensitive."

    "dialogue": "dimplanttnf: The following information provides some useful tips to help aid the healing process of teeth implants.IF LOCAL ANESTHESIA WAS USED: Usually the anesthesia usually lasts 3 to 4 hours. To avoid injury to the tongue, cheeks or lips, avoid chewing until the numbness goes away. It is also advisable to avoid hot drinks and / or foods until the effects disappear completely.FIRST AND SECOND WEEK OF TREATMENT\nAt eating time: Avoid any excessive pressure on dental implants. You should only eat soft, nutritious foods for a period of 2-4 weeks. Avoid sticky or hard foods and also maintain a high protein diet.Medications: Take antibiotics and pain relief pills as prescribed. Do not stop taking antibiotics, according to the time prescribed by the doctor. If you have any side effects caused by the medication, call your dentist. Take painkillers, only if necessary.Hygiene: Avoid brushing the area with surgical bandage around the implant; rinse your mouth with a good mouthwash at least 2 times a day. That will help keep the implant area always clean.\nPhysical activity: Avoid physical activities and heavy lifting. This may cause bleeding around dental implants.If you drink alcohol: Avoid it for 2 weeks until the tissues surrounding the implants heal correctly.If you smoke: Avoid smoking for at least 3 days before surgery and for 2 weeks after treatment, otherwise the healing process will be slower than normal. In addition, the substances contained in cigarettes can cause other negative reactions.Food and Drinks: Avoid foods or hot drinks, spicy or acidic. Do not eat crunchy or hard food, because this will put more pressure on the dental implant. A surgical dressing is placed around the area of dental implants. This curettage should remain in place for two weeks and do not use a toothpick or touch the dental implant area with your tongue.Ice pack: An ice pack should be applied externally on the dental implant site, as much as possible during the first 3 days. This will help reduce inflammation.Dentures: If you wear dentures, this will loosen a bit to not apply pressure to the dental implant. The denture is placed with a protective dressing and should not be removed for two weeks.THIRD WEEK\nLightly brush the dental implant site after you have removed the surgical bandage. (Usually two weeks after surgery). Apply some mouthwash to your toothbrush and brush gently around the treated areas.FOURTH WEEK\nResume normal cleaning of the area around the dental implant. gotbfdk: thanks i will use"

    "title": "What is a Dental Implant and What is it Used for?",
    "dialogue": "dentalimplantsbridge: A dental implant is an artificial tooth root replacement that is used in prosthetic dentistry to support restorations that resemble a tooth or group of teeth. Dental implants are very commonly used in the world today, and can be used either for health reasons and cosmetic purposes.Dental Implant Surgery\nDental implant surgery is the surgery that is used to insert the dental implant. The typical dental implant consists of a titanium screw with a roughened surface, and the surface on the implant is treated either by plasma spraying or sandblasting in order to increase the integration potential of the implant. There are various different types of dental implants that can be used in this procedure. This offers patients a lot of variety and the ability to make the right decision just for them and their needs.The implant surgery is performed as an outpatient procedure. This means that the patient is not required to stay overnight and that they are generally able to leave the clinic or hospital immediately after and return to doing their normal day to day activities.\nA single dental implant procedure involves an incision and flapping of the gum and usually takes about an hour, and multiple implants can even be installed in a single procedure. This makes it very convenient for the patient because rather than them having to come back several times to have all of their implants installed they can get it all done in a single procedure.Remember that dental implants come in all different shapes, sizes and textures, and you will need to work with your dentist in order to determine which particular dental implant is going to work best for you. If you have broken a tooth or would just like a different look to your teeth, dental implants are a great option and may be the perfect choice for you.\nIf you are interested in going through with this procedure then there are a few things you are going to need to do. You are going to need to learn more about it first and what your options are, and then make an appointment with your doctor, so you can discuss with them your ideas on the procedure. Not all people are eligible candidates for this procedure so this will also need to be determined, but it is definitely a popular dental procedure with a very high success rate, and one of the first that should be considered. johnmoran12: A dental implant is an artificial tooth root that is placed into your jaw to hold a replacement tooth or bridge. Dental implants may be an option for people who have lost a tooth or teeth due to periodontal disease, an injury, or some other reason.For patients who are missing teeth or want to stabilize their dentures, dental implants may be the ultimate solution for them. While dental implants may be more costly than other solutions, they are definitely the gold standard for tooth replacement and denture stabilization."

My first born is now 7 years old, he lost his first tooth when he was around 3 3/4 years old.  He tripped hit his mouth on the chair and his tooth (9) was out forward about 90 degrees.  I took him to a dentist they took an X-Ray and yanked the tooth out.  Back then we thought the XRay showed his second tooth ALREADY coming in... Like I said... He's seven now and he lost his other front tooth (8), he's also lost teeth 23, 24, 25, 26.  ALL of his teeth have grown in EXCEPT for #9.  Now we havent thought much of it until last week when my wife asked me what I thought about and it thought... \"Hmm well that is weird...\".  So we are going to take him to the dentist  in mid September but I wanted to know what you all thought about such a situation?  Besides \"going to the dentist\" has anyone had a similar situation?  What was the result AFTER the visit?   What was the outcome?  We are certainly afraid of his tooth never growing in, it's almost made me cry (in private for course) at times.  Also I've wondered if something like this can contribute to any kind of pain a child may feel... he does complain about headaches once in a while but the doctor said he's fine.Anyway, your help is appreciated.   I know the ONLY thing we can do is wait for time and a bit more time to pass by to see if it ever grows in.\nThanks in advance! lharri: if the tooth is lost early because of some type of traumatic event the bone will grow over the permanent tooth and slow the eruption process. It will usually correct itself over time. Go to your dentist and let him take and xray and make sure everything is ok."

In between that time in 2008, I had a sinus lift and then 6 implants were put in on top and 5 on the bottom. In 2011, I lost 1 implant on top.  This year, I lost another implant on top.  I went back to the oral surgeon & he said that my maxilla bone is totally deteriorated & that the other implants on top will fall out shortly as will the bottom implants & my 7 remaining teeth!  Then I went to John Hopkins Hospital (Baltimore) and their Prosthrodontist told me that he would make me a set of upper false teeth to bide me over until the upper bone is gone completely!  Great!! I went back to see him in October & after he took a 3D x-ray, he told me that he was \"sorry\" but he WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO make me the false teeth after all as he can see the maxilla bone is just about gone!  No one anywhere has been able to tell me why in the heck this has happened to me.  They will not take the bone from my hip to put in my mouth as they are afraid that my other health issues will not allow me to heal properly.  Thus I sit here wondering what I'll look like when I lose everything bone, implants and the rest of my own teeth when both bones in my mouth are gone!  My self-esteem is just about gone.  My husband doesn't understand how mortified I am in a restaurant. Trying to speak is just about impossible because without upper teeth, you are unable to form certain words.  How wonderful! Anyone else in this situation, I sure hope not! lharri: mortifiedCan you get your xrays and post"

The first root canal on this tooth was about 13 yrs ago and the bottom of the root was completed.  I was having lots of pressure around tooth 30 like someone was gripping it real hard and also lower jaw pain.  Fast forward... 2012  pain never went away, had the crown removed, still didn't help. had the tooth extracted Feb of this years.  Tooth was shattered and came out in pieces.   Had a bone graft done at the same time as the extraction.   Beginning June I went back to the oral surgeon was still having pressure.  Took a panoramic x-ray, said it healed great.  Sent me to a Endodontist who ended up doing a root canal on #28. When Ice was put on the tooth I jumped a mile.  The root canal was done , no issues. and yet here I am July 8th, and my lower mouth on the same side is full of pressure, I can't stand it.  My dentist talked to both my oral surgeon and endodontist and he wants me to go to a pain specialist, thinking that my teeth are very off balance, I don't chew on the left side due to the pressure and pain.   I called the specialist they all want me to go to but can't get in till September.   I can't live on painkillers for ever.   Nothing is showing on xrays.  could I have permanant nerve damage.

    "dialogue": "cosset: First off, sorry for the long post!Ok, about 12 hours ago I had a full mouth extraction done with no sedation or benzodiazepine to help with the procedure. I had 4 teeth removed from the top and 7 removed from the bottom. I have been in severed pain ever since then. I'm just miserable. To the point where Im being a real dick to my lovely girlfriend and also my very supportive parents who were nice enough to pay for this procedure. I have not slept one single bit. The dentist prescribed me twenty(20) 7.5/325 Hydrocodone/APAP. These things are not working worth a damn at all. I'm almost tempted to go to the Emergency Room or something.Let me add some more here. A few months ago I had a nasty fall and shattered the scaphoid bone in my left hand. The bone pressed up against the nerve and thus made my thump and 2 first fingers get VERY swollen, numbness, tingling, burning, lightning like nerve pain. My doctor put me on Hydrocodone 7.5mg while we were getting ready to do surgery. I was on it about a month. Then I had a Scaphoid reunion surgery and he had to use a piece of donor bone to fix it properly. He essentially rebuilt that part of my hand and made one scaphoid out of 4 different pieces of bone. He also did a surgery to the median nerve in my left hand to relieve some of the swelling the hopefully get the feelings back in my left hands thumb, pointer and middle fingers. So essentially he rebuilt the bottom of my left hand. It was a pretty serious surgery.After surgery I was put on 15mg Roxicodone for a week, 5-6 times per day for about 5 days. Then we stepped down to 10mg Percocet for the next week, then down to 5mg Percocet for another week. After that we stepped down to the 10mg Hydrocodone because the bone still hurts sometimes but also the nerve pain from that median nerve is bad sometimes. I stopped taking the 10mg hydrocodone a week ago once I found out my mom and dad were going to pay for me to get my teeth done. So I was off of it about a week. I talked to my Doctor that did my hand surgery and he said to make sure to tell the dentist about my surgery and medication history because I was on those meds for so long he said that whatever they would normally give would probably not alleviate my pain at all due to how long I was on the Oxycodone/Hydrocodone.I went over all of this with my dentist. He didn't seem to give a crap at all and wrote me for twenty(20) 7.5/325 Hydrocodone/APAP.This is not helping me one single bit. It almost as though he didn't believe me even though my left hand/wrist is still in a fiberglass cast. They were using 3 pins stuck through my wrist to hold the new Scaphoid in place for the first month and then we took them out and went to the cast. I am just in complete misery. What should I do about this? Should I call this dentist when 8:00am rolls around? He seemed pretty serious that all he was going to give me was the 7.5/325s. He is also 250 miles a way. I am at a loss here. I do also have a very nice local doctor that has always taken care of me and my family. Would I have better luck calling him and explaining the situation and see if he will see me about this. I think this is my only other option other than going to the Emergency Room where my mom just so happens to work. I know they will give me like 3 days of pains meds but usually they only give like 12-15 5mg/500mg Hydrocodone/APAP but obviously if the 7.5s don't work I don't see how this will help me. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Its 4am, im miserable and got a few hours before stuff opens up. Thanks everyone. Sorry it is so damn long lol.\n-Cosset cosset: Its now 530am. I am going to start making phone calls at 8am. So I am hoping there is some late night people that will chime in with their opinions before then hehe. Much appreciated -Cosset cosset: sigh 630am. Haven't slept in like 30 hours. too miserable  bump cosset: 13 views and nobody has any idea on this  I'm so miserable right now. Oh wells. Almost 7am. One more hour and hopefully I can get this resolved  -Cosset cosset: 38 minutes and I am going to call my doctor. The dentist yesterday seemed to be set in his ways that all he would give me was the 7.5s. He didn't seem to care about my history, even when I told him that my doctor told me specifically to remind him about my recent surgeries and how long I have been on the pain meds so he could adjust the dosage. -Cosset"

This is called \"nocturnal bruxism\" or \"sleep-related bruxism.\" It can have a variety of causes, nothing more than a habit. It also can be a result of the body's reaction when the teeth do not line up or come together properly. It also can be a symptom of certain rare diseases of the nerves and muscles in the face. People with severe bruxism can break dental fillings or damage their teeth. Rubbing the teeth together can cause the outer layers of enamel to wear away, exposing dentin.

    "dialogue": "frankjohnson: I went in for a regular cleaning recently and was told I had a cavity near the gum line on my lower back molar.  The dentist ground the tooth down to do the filling and it was slightly painful as she did that. I didn't have any sensitivity/pain there before the filling.  However, after the filling it became very sensitive along the gum line to hot or cold.  I went back in a week later and they confirmed that the gum had been ground away slightly and the root was exposed.  They put some 'desensitizing solution' on it, which seemed to cause more pain than reduce any.  They said it would just take time for the gum to grow back over the root (maybe 30 days or so, they estimated).  It's been about 30 days now and it's still very sensitive.  I have had some gum recession too so I'm worried that the gum will not grow back over the root.  The whole thing seemed a bit hastily done to me and I'm a bit frustrated that I went into the dentist without pain and now I have a recurring sensitivity.Is this a normal thing to happen when doing a filling?Could it be that it will just take longer for the gum to grow back over or should something else be done?"

    "dialogue": "lawrence12: Hello, I recently had a tooth removed, the tooth here that had a rooth canal on the xray. I decided to have it pulled for long term health reasons. I decided to have a removeable bridge that will latch on my last molar and premolar. But my last molar has a small shallow composite filling and this will have to be shaved off a bit. Since I want this to last very long I was thinking of replacing this filling with a cerec restoration then have the bridge made since this tooth is very important. But I was wondering if I could effectively remineralize the dentin or make it go hard and glassy brown with good nutrition and simply have all the filling removed and keep the dentin exposed and have the bridge sit on that instead of a cerec restoration. I want no more problems down the road due to this filling getting old or leaking or whatever else then possibly compromising solidity of my bridge, filling is 2 year old and is fine, so either i have it removed, or have a cerec inlay made, i trust my hygiene more than i trust a composite filling. i have read a few studies where innovative dentists prefer to leave open non decaying cavities instead of filling it so bacteria doesnt get trapped in and no remineralization can take place since everything is covered up. Is this viable to leave shallow dentin open and exposed or should I just have a cerec restoration for 1000$ then my bridge done ? I'm the kind of person with irreprochable hygiene now, I never eat sweets and always clean my teeth after meals even while at work. havent had cavities for over 2 years i heard dentin can remineralize with good nutrition like calcium, phorphorous, vitamin k2 supplements, gc tooth moose and fluoride rinse."

It took two weeks to get my crown and I noticed sensitivity again.

It doesn't feel like the time it was infected, but I feel soreness and some pain through pressure. Today, I went back and he agreed to do the root canal again... My question is why? Just to fill it, go through the pain and have the same problem. 'My questions:Is there something he's not telling me?Is he missing something? Because he says he can't see anything in the new x-ray. But this time he said he noticed a circle around the top of the root canal in the old x-ray post 1st root canal, but said before, that he couldn't have known there was an infection till he opened it.

    "dialogue": "paranoidaboutteeth: I have a finished root canal, without a crown on it. It's been like that for about 2 years now. And am getting the crown on it in the next two months. The past couple of weeks I have noticed that the gum around that tooth is a little bit lower, and there is a little bit of whiteness showing through the gum. Around the time that I noticed this I did switch to a mechanical tooth brush, which just irritated my entire mouth because I was using it too vigorously. I'm just concerned that this is caused by something other than my switching to that brush or something else entirely. I have switched back to just an old fashioned soft bristled bush because of all the irritation. \nI'm going to the dentist sometime this week for a cleaning and will point it out to them, but I was just wondering if I could get some opinions beforehand. Thank you! pascale1973: It's a good thing you have a dental appointment.\nWhite showing on the gums!...hopefully it's not an absess, depends on the white, is it like a zit or just white.  An old fashioned soft bristled brush is a good idea, I tore up my gums and caused myself recession using an electric tooth brush.  Good luck, hopefully all is well and you get that tooth crowned.  A tooth with a root canal is weaker than a tooth without a root canal, just be glad you haven't broken it."

Dental  X Rays showed that he is missing 2 permanent teeth in the upper jaw and 3 missing in the bottom jaw. He is under the local dental hospital and they see him every 6 months. Yesterday we went and they say that he also has microdontia as the permanent teeth that are coming through are small.Now, he doesn't have any other developmental problems to our knowledge - he seems to be growing nice and tall although he's very slim! I made the mistake of googling the problems and it seems that it can be linked to developmental problems and low growth and hormone deficiency etc.So, I'm quite worried now - should I follow this up with our GP for blood tests to check hormone levels? Is this Hypodontia and Microdontia really uncommon? Starting to worry now..."

The first question I would ask is can you make the tooth hurt just by clenching your teeth or grinding your teeth?  If the answer is yes, your temporary crown is high and the bite needs to be adjusted.  The next most likely thing is that is temp crown is loose and needs a stronger cement to hold it on.  The third possibility is that your tooth is cracked into the pulp (nerve) in which case you need root canal to eliminate the pain.  Don't put the permanent crown on until this is resolved or you might find yourself with a hole in your brand new crown after the Root canal is done."

    "dialogue": "mebrittany: December 31st, 2010 I went to a dentist for a teeth cleaning. The dentist looked at my teeth and told me I needed 4 crowns. At the time I was a 22 year old single college student that also works full time. I told them I wanted to think it over, but they told me if I waited then the cost of the crowns would come out of my insurance balance for 2011 instead of 2010. Had me sign up for a loan, I told them I couldn't afford it and they reassured me that the payments would be low and that my insurance would pay me back. Said insurance would cover everything. They made it sound like I had to have dental surgery immediately. So since it sounded so dyer, I went against my better judgment and let them do dental surgery on my teeth that day. They put in temporary crowns, later installed the permanent ones. My insurance told me that based on the x-rays of my teeth, only 1 of the 4 crowns installed were needed. They refused to pay because of this. On February 10, 2012 I went to another dentist office for a teeth cleaning and they told me that 3 out of the 4 crowns had been placed incorrectly and that they would have to be replaced. I've contacted two attorney's on the matter, one of them didn't do dental claims, the other said I would loss money if I took legal action. I live on an aide's salary with my boyfriend who is unemployed, not really seeing any options. Any advice? I'll take anything."

    "title": "How to find locations for Dental Office?",
    "dialogue": "Peterosky: Does anyone have an idea of where you can do some research if your thinking about opening up your own practice? wastas1: google earth Bucky Tooth: This is a good question.  My husband is looking to open his own dental practice and finding it hard to pick the right location...  Anyone else have some suggestions? RickScottDDS: If you are looking for a good location to open a new office there are several factors to consider.  First would be having a good amount of people in the area that need to be serviced.  Low population areas normally already have a local dentist set up whom people have gone to since they were young, whereas in larger cities people tend to not even know their own dentist and just go to whoever will offer them the best deal so you will have a great deal more business and you can mail flyers around the neighborhoods once you open with a special incentive and will have a good amount of people coming to you from the start without as much work.  Also look into what other businesses are nearby.  See what other dentistry offices are in the area and how close and who is closer to the main roads.  Make sure no major construction is going on or is set to go on shortly in the area you are looking at.  I have seen 2 dental offices go out of business due to poor location and people being unable to reach them well due to construction that lasted for over a year,  A good idea if you are interested would be to offer the extra hurdle of exceptional guest service.  Even a themed dental office.  For instance, some dentistry offices offer free coffee and donuts while waiting and I have heard people rave about these offices even when their work is shoddy due to the extra customer care.  There was a place in Orlando, Florida that was phenomenal that had wall to wall business and has been a success since it first opened.  It was called Star Base Dental I believe and it is probably still around.  They played only Star Trek movies and episodes while you were in the waiting room, had headphones while you were being worked on and mini tv's in each area so patients could watch Star Trek during their visit and the workers dressed in Star Trek uniforms.  At the end of the visit the doctor came in and saw the patient off saying \"live long and prosper\" and making the Vulcan sign with the hand.  Because of this theme and the fact that no other offices I have seen have done this type of thing yet other than this office, they swept the entire field in the area.  Everyone talked of them and even would drive an extra half hour to get to them as if they were their own theme park or event.  Point being if you incorporate a theme or some form of exceptional guest service you will stand out from the rest, get more recommendations and will do well regardless of any area you are in.  Best of luck to you. pascale1973: A good dentist could be anywhereIn today's market, finding the right location isn't as important as being visible on the web.  Ofcourse you don't want to open an office right next door to another but you know I'm in california and every corner probably has a dental office, in reality, if you are good and people like you, you will be successful wherever you are.  what's very important is to do a search on google and see how many people you will be competing against locally, I'll give you an example go to google and type in corona del mar dentist, this is my area, there's a quick count of how many people are competing for that, than do another search newport beach dentist and see how many are competing for that top spot.  Corona Del Mar is about 1 mile away from Newport Beach, so more and more people are using the internet to find a good dentist, doing a good job is very important because everyone will know via the net.  More importantly is if you are doing a good job and they are talking about it, you want to be able to show up in order to have new patients. gimics, themes, bla bla bla, people still want excellent dentistry, just make sure you are smart in maybe not picking the most populated (dental office areas web wise) you could be 3 feet away and better off.\nGood Luck! fredravez: Peterosky said:\t\t\tDoes anyone have an idea of where you can do some research if your thinking about opening up your own practice?\n\t\t\nClick to expand...\nHi\nI guess you better open at a place where you can expect more patients.

    "dialogue": "Ella9656: On January 16, 2012, I went to see Dr. Blank to continue dental work that Dr.X had started, but was unable to complete because he relocated. \nOn January 16, 2012, Dr. Blank charged my care credit card $4386.00 prior to any work being performed and stated it was standard procedure, and because they had to order an abutment for a dental implant that needed to be activated.  The following week Dr. Blank performed three extractions and removed gum that was covering the fifth implant that needed to be activated (Dr. X had taken care of all prior work).  The plan of treatment was to create an over denture to cover my existing teeth which would attach to the implants.  I wanted this because it is more cost effective until my twins are older; I am done with graduate school and then eventually go to bridgework and all crowns.  Dr. X completed restoration of bottom teeth.\nDr. Blank took impressions of my mouth to prepared a wax model of the over denture.  At the visit, he said that the lab could not create a wax over denture because the three healthy teeth that Dr. X had put gold copings on to protect them were in the way.  Here removed and sanded down all the gold copings, and suggested I have 4 crowns (one would be a floater in the front and create an over denture to do around the crowns).  In addition, I could review the model that week and brought me a paper to sign while in the chair.  At that time Dr. Blank stated I should pay the lab $600.00 for a temporary appliance to see how it would look, function and feel because he would hate for me to  go right to the final product, activate the implant and have me be unhappy.  On February 6, 2012, I paid his office for four crowns and 600.00 for a temporary over denture totaling $3516.00.\nI went in the following day to see and try the wax model of the 4 crowns and over denture.  And it was terrible, --it looked like baby teeth, --my teeth were not even visible when I smiled.  \nThe following day I went to work with the lab technician to create the appliance and crowns to be sure they fit.  At that time, it was determined that we could not do the 4 crowns with the over denture appliance and have it fit and look right.  At that time, I asked for a refund on the crowns, and receptionists said she would have to wait until Dr. Blank told her to issue it.February 13, 2012, I went to Dr. Blank to have the temporary appliance that I paid the lab $600.00 for placed in my mouth.  At that time Dr. Blank stated that the lab said that they could not create an over denture with the existing teeth and it would more than likely break within a week.  Dr. Blank advised me to have another three teeth removed and implants placed immediately (these are healthy teeth that Dr. X had covered and protected with the gold copings and Dr. Blank removed earlier).  Dr. Blank stated that if I didn’t have implants placed after he extracted the three teeth, it would  could result in bone loss –which then he would have to do a bone graft involving removing bone from my chin and knee to be placed in mouth to support implants.  He further added he could not even be sure there was enough bone anyways, and he still may have to do a bone graft. Dr. Blank further shaved down crowns and veneers that were completed on the bottom of my mouth because he said it was affecting my bite.  I made an appointment for Wednesday, 2/15/2012.  I was in tears when I left the office.  I again asked the receptionist for the refund and she stated that Dr. Blank said when all his work was completed he would credit me back the difference or charge me if I owed money.\nWhen I got home things just started to seem strange.  I was very upset; it made no logical sense for me to have healthy teeth removed.  Every dentist I have seen since the original accident in 8th grade and after the second accident, a few years ago….always took every measure everything measure to preserve healthy teeth.  Not to mention, the entire purpose of an over denture was to preserve teeth.  Dr. X had successfully made an over denture while protecting and preserving the natural teeth…and prior to that Dr. XX who did 3 sinus lifts, bone grafts and placed the 5 implants had made a temporary cemented bridge to cover existing teeth while implants healed, and I never had any problems.\nLater that evening I called Dr. Blank and explained that I did not want to have three healthy teeth removed and that I wanted the money for the crowns refunded.  He said he would do it later.\nThat is when I had enough.  In less than a month, Dr. Blank had charged my care credit over $9000.00 for work not provided.  On February 14, 2012, I contacted United Healthcare and Care Credit because claims were submitted and my care credit card billed for services that had not been performed.\nAt lunchtime on 2/14/2012, receptionist from Dr. Blank’s office called me about the appointment Wednesday for the extractions.  I told her I would no longer be continuing my dental work at his office and wanted refunded for all work that was not completed.  I said my husband would be over to pick up my records and receipts for all that they had charged me.  Later that day I received two messages that she had spoken Dr. Blank and he would refund me for the crowns.  My husband went over to Dr. Blank’s office.  The receptionist refused to give my husband anything, even a list of charges and he is the primary insurance holder (he could have at least had the bills and receipts).  She gave him a consent form for me to fill out but would not issue credit my care credit account.\nOn Thursday 2/16/2012, the receptionist called me in the morning.  I returned her call.  She stated that Dr. Blank would refund the crown money only if I agreed to sign a paper stating that I would consider the $600.00 temporary, the final product--, and Dr. Blank would keep the $3250.00 (the final product charge).  I explained to her that I will not sign this paper because it is not the final product and asked am I going to have to get an attorney?  Later that afternoon, my husband again went with my signed consent form for my records, the care credit card, and again they refused to give me my records or refund any money.  On my behalf, a member from the MADA contacted Dr. Blanks’ office and advised them that they cannot hold my records ransom.  And they still refused.  At this time, I do not have my records or a list of charges from his office.  I am going by United Healthcare claims that were submitted and my Care Credit Statements.\nAgain, I spoke to receptionist and she said Dr. Blank agreed the only way he would refund all of the money was if I return the temporary appliance that was in my mouth.  I explained to her that I will have nothing in my mouth but three sawed down teeth that were no longer protected, four activated implants, and one uncovered implant not yet activated or protected.  How could you ask me to do that?  She then said that Dr. Blank advised her that she is no longer allowed to speak with me, and she had to follow his orders, he signs her paychecks.  I got off the phone and just broke down in tears.\nI contacted a member of the local Dental Review Board.  It was suggested I try one more time to speak with Dr. Blank directly rather than his receptionists.  Later that evening in an attempt to straighten this matter out, I called Dr. Blanks’ office; Dr. Blank answered and hung up on me.  \nOn Friday, February 17, 2012, I made a final attempt to speak with Dr. Blank and called his other office.  I spoke with his receptionist and asked her to have him call me.  He never called.\nSo my credit has been exhausted.  I am in a temporary appliance.  I have to go to another dentist to continue this work, but I need my money back in order to start over. \nIn addition, during all of this, I find out that Dr. Blank was sentenced by Attorney General to a 3-year jail sentence and the judge gave him probation and community service 8 years ago for Medicaid Fraud, ordered to pay money and fines."

The filling is on the side of my tooth near the gum line.  This was about 10 years, ago.  Occasionally I pick at the filling because it's not smooth.  3 weeks ago it popped out when I picked too hard .  It doesn't hurt, it's just a hole.When I went to the dentist - immediately he said root canal.  This is a new dentist - Aspen Dental - as I moved recently.  I'm not sure if he's trying to up-sell me to an expensive procedure not to mention the crown.  On the other hand, there can be quacks that say sure we can refill knowing 2-3 years from now it will fail and I have to come back in for an expensive procedure..  Aspen referred me to some external endodontists and said that Aspen will be responsible for the post root canal work.What would you do?  Refill or root canal?  To me, the more of my natural tooth I can keep the better.  Not sure which is more riskier and will cause less problems in the future.  Money isn't the issue, it's trying to keep as much as I can of my tooth and to mitigate any headaches in the future.  Any advice greatly appreciated!"

    "dialogue": "mike444: I'm 22 years old and have many some very poor decisions in my life when it came to my oral health. Those bad choices turned into habits which I was never able to break. Now it's too late. I have already had my molars removed and it's inevitably going to happen to the rest of my teeth. I have been doing quite a bit of research about dentures and am trying to get comfortable with the fact that I'll need them before too long.I've always had a small, crowded mouth. With the fairly recent removal (6 months) of my molars, my wisdom teeth are finally coming in. My bottom left is pretty much completely in and my top right and top left are about half way in. My lower left still hasn't broken the surface yet.I want to get dentures before too long. Is this even possible at this moment? Should I wait until my wisdom teeth are completely in? Price is a big reason I'm strongly considering dentures. But a bigger reason is the time all the procedures would take. I just want to be able to smile and love life! I know that with all the other procedures I need, it would be a very long time until I got to the point of being comfortable smiling in public... and that's if the procedures even worked. I feel as if dentures are the quick and cost effective way for me to move on to a more enjoyable life."

I am getting the teeth removed in about a month.  I am reading that these are likely dentigerous cysts.Does this sound plausible?  Should I be taking antibiotics for these?  My dentist said nothing about that, but I don't want to risk some horrible blood infection.Thank you very much."

Twenty years ago, she had a serious auto accident and lost her mandibular central and lateral incisor, mandibular molars on the right side; Along with her maxillary right first and second molars she initially wore a temporary acrylic partial denture for three years that was replaced by her current removable partial denture that she has worn for ten years. The fit and appearance of the partial denture is poor. Her excellent periodontal health, Tooth position, size and occlusion would tolerate either a fixed or removable dentureYou have explained to Ms.julia that she will not have occlusion on tooth #16 if a #33-34 porcelain fixed partial denture is made, but she does not care. You agree to submit pre-estimate for a fixed partial denture along with radiograph to her dental insurance company. Her dental insurance has $250 deductible with a co-pay of 50%for prosthodontics, for maximum annual benefit of $1,000Five week later, you receive a replay and a rejection of the treatment plan with an explanation that a removable partial denture would be allowable. Ms.julia is upset and insists that you complete the fixed partial denture. Submit it as a removable partial denture, and she will pay the balance you explain to her that is illegal, but she again insists that you follow her decisionwhat would you do?"

    "dialogue": "Toofy: ok, about 9 months ago I had to get a crown on my front tooth.My dentist carved away at the tooth bone to create a \"V\" shaped cone. A crown was fit and everything was fine. However, I bit down on some food and heard a crack. The crown didn't break, but the bone did. The tooth is now unstable where I can wiggle the crown back and forth. When I bite down on food it hurts.What are my options now? pascale1973: Depending on how bad!Wow, it sounds painful and annoying quite frankly, if the crown didn't break it sounds like the tooth structure underneath did, not knowing wether you had a root canal on this tooth or not make a big difference, you didn't mention pain so I wonder if you've had a prior root canal on this tooth.  The reason i mention this is because when there's a root canal, generally they place a post and buildup a structure on top of that to create the tooth structure under the crown.  If the tooth structure is still acceptable and you see a good dentist that really likes \"saving teeth\", you might be able to have a post and buildup done and a new crown put on top, the worst part is it's a new crown and you can't reuse it.  I'd say go back to the same dentist and see if he's kind enough to discount it since he just had it done."

    "title": "Brown Spots on tooth?",
    "dialogue": "JDS5607: Hi All.\nI had a tooth extracted about three weeks ago. I experienced very little pain afterwards. However, the other day I started having pain in the general area that my tooth was pulled from. The teeth on either side of the vacant spot have small brown spots on them where the teeth touched, and the pain seems to be coming from one of the teeth. My question is, are these spots normal and will they go away, or are they cavities being uncovered by the extraction?My dentist did an oral exam without x-rays but I'm wondering if he missed this spot because it was covered by my tooth??Any help would be greatly appreciated. pascale1973: Should have it checked out NOW!If your dentist did his exam without x-rays prior to the extraction, it's possible those spots were not visible and were covered by the tooth that was extracted.  It is very important to have them checked out, if you're already feeling pain those cavities could be quite deep and the longer you wait the worse your chances are in saving the tooth from a root canal.  Unfortunately with dentistry, the longer you wait the worse things do get.  If you go early enough it could be a simple fix like a composite filling.  good luck!"

Recently, I had excruciating throbbing in tooth #19 and had to have it extracted.  My question is which would be better a bridge between tooth 18 which has already had a root canal and #20 which is a virgin tooth or a single implant for #19 even though I am told I am a clencher and it may break? jessica: Implants or dental bridgeIt is better if you opt for dental implants than getting dental bridge. Implants are the best way to replace missing teeth. If you are in habit of clenching your teeth, then you can get mouth guards for it. Thomas Bird: Whatever you do DON'T GET A BRIDGE! Those teeth they destroy to support the bridge will need to be dealt with in 10 years or less and your only option at that point is going to be a removable denture. Bridges are the biggest ripoff in the history of dentistry but dentists love to do them because they are big cash cows for them. Go with the implant or even a single-tooth partial denture. Trust me its a much better and healthier option than the bridge. I just had a six crown bridge removed and now I am having all my roots yanked out along with it and replaced with a partial denture. And I just turned 44! sqwerl: jessica said:\t\t\tIt is better if you opt for dental implants than getting dental bridge. Implants are the best way to replace missing teeth.

The success  rates are very, very high and they can last longer and are sometimes  easier to take care of than bridges. They keep the place of the tooth in  the old socket and prevent further bone loss. The downsides are they're  expensive and your gums will take time to heal. Obviously, not everyone  is a candidate.Tooth Replacement with Dental ImplantsDental Implants | AAOMS.orgBone loss is going to occur with bridges and partials. Neither option is  perfect and each have their own trade-offs. It's an inevitable fact and  you will end up losing more and more remaining teeth as the bone loss  continues. The primary reason for bridge failure is poor hygiene which  needs to be taken care of and decay between the bridge and supporting  teeth which makes it imperative to visit a dentist regularly for  cleanings and checkups. Pressure the bridge causes on the joining teeth  can also cause them to crack. This can be compounded by periodontal  disease, diabetes, and other disease.

    "dialogue": "Chris: Hi, I'm deaf so please pardon my grammar if it's terrible. I had a tiny black dot on one of my teeth which turned out to be a cavity. I had it for years because my first dentist told me that it was a \"pre-cavity\" and that I didn't really need to have it taken care of. The tooth hurt every time I chewed food and brushed on this tooth but I didn't really complain about it to anyone because it wasn't that bad.\n\nI moved to a different dentist to get a second opinion. On the first checkup at the new dentist office, the hygienist said that I had a cavity and needed to get rid of it. I agreed to have the cavity removed so I got a filling on Thursday, the 20th. I was given Novocaine but I still felt every damn thing. I felt the hygienist drilling on my nerve and then filled the tooth. She told me that the cavity was completely gone. \n\nBefore I got rid of the cavity, it hurt while both brushing and chewing on the tooth. Now with the new filling, it doesn't hurt at all while I brush my teeth but it hurts EVEN MORE than before the cavity was \"gone\" while eating. Every time I have food on this tooth, it hits my nerve. It seriously feels like I was shocked by something. The pain has WORSENED. \n\nA friend told me that it can take up to three weeks for the pain to go away but I just have a feeling that this is permanent damage. Maybe my OCD is just making me paranoid. What could be the issue? Is it permanently damaged? How long should I wait before calling the dentist office again? It's just annoying to have to chew only on the right side of my mouth. Thanks so much for any answers!!"

Filling must be very close to the nerve that's why it must be causing pain. If filling is quite deep, then You may require root canal treatment for it. Liner and base is given in case of deep fillings to provide protection. jzdp: Thanks for the reply and article. Dentist did say it was not a deep filling. From the article, it may be due to polymerization shrinkage tugging at the tooth. thomascarlyle: Hi\n\nDear JZDP, \n\nI would suggest you first scrap your dentist and go consult a good dental surgeon even if he charges more.

Sedation dentistry can be quite complex, and most dentists who are interested in using these drugs must be licensed to do so.

Is it mainly marketed toward those with fear of dentists? jessica: conscious sedation\n\nIf the patient is apprehensive or a complicated extraction procedure is to be performed, then conscious sedation such as laughing gas is given to the patient. If some extensive procedure is to be done in children, then also conscious sedation is given. jessica: Dentist may or may not employ sedation technique. if a simple filling or scaling is to be done, then sedation is not required to be given to the patient."
